CPE_15,"**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we handle rubbish is quite similar. Municipal refuse collection happens regularly, where rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to be disposed of. Economists find this system strange because, in most places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free; the more rubbish people throw away, the more resources are needed for collection and disposal, which costs local authorities money.

The basic economic issue is that if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to charge households for the actual cost of disposing of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling options. However, research by economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman shows that this logical solution can lead to unexpected and sometimes disappointing results.

Their research looked at several American towns that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these tags are collected. In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman examined a scheme introduced in Charlottesville, Virginia, in July 1992, where residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors found that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing, selling, and managing it. 

Although the number of bags collected dropped by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people compacted their rubbish into bags instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfill sites. The actual weight of rubbish collected only decreased by 14%, which is a better measure of disposal costs. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, rubbish collection also fell by 3.5%. 

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. While hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in recycled materials, indicating that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the new fees, as many residents were already recycling voluntarily.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that while pricing does reduce the amount of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to have a big impact. 

It’s also important to consider other factors like income and education. For instance, wealthier towns tend to produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Understanding these effects often requires detailed economic analysis, and sometimes the outcomes are not as positive as we hope."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Simply being successful in your career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even those who are famous often feel bitterness. Until recently, enjoying your work was enough to be part of a lucky few. Now, you must consider how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you dull and unable to connect with others outside your field, or if you are so focused on details that you lack wisdom, imagination, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am trying to find ways for work to prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, help discover hidden talents, and foster diverse human connections. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. This is too simplistic because as more people get educated, they seek jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A lifetime of work should be viewed as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. Even middle-class jobs, like those of doctors, accountants, and architects, often lack the freedom and satisfaction they once had. Doctors may feel more stressed than their patients, accountants question their profession's ethics, and architects rarely get to use their creativity. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, the companies and institutions they work for are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values align with those of their organizations.

I have started a study of various occupations to see how they shape or harm individuals. I have looked at how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I am now focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. While many experts work to increase the profits of companies, we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider the kind of people we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers as an example; 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. There is a vast amount of untapped potential. Many intelligent and energetic people endure low pay and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the Ritz, which represents a 19th-century idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they often have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel managers could utilize the knowledge of their student employees instead of assigning them only basic tasks. By understanding their staff's true ambitions, they could discover many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 

It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and to move beyond traditional categories. For me, work is about relationships. Many people now want work to reflect their independence and personality, so they should have the opportunity to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with minds that may seem very different at first. While everyone acknowledges the importance of communication, true conversation is different. The new kind of conversation that people crave today is more intimate and creates a bond of respect, allowing for a deeper understanding of one another. This type of interaction is not just relaxing; it is the most effective way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation has the power to change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources, like a bucket of seeds, meant for spreading and reproducing.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the start as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible substitute for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published detailed guides on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA and was often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public spaces, especially in Britain and Germany.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. However, these systems did not pose a real threat to the rise of domestic television. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most effective way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of a home equipped for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to more centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable communities.

Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens and helped create a sense of unity within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television.

However, it is important to recognize the positive role of broadcasting in supporting democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries viewed broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It’s natural to want to create a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities, often sending the message that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive advertisements constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all urging us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and ecosystems. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge, which has led to significant research efforts. Their natural presence has been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-experts to understand, but simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience remains essential in turning data into accurate weather forecasts. Observations made by people can offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is mainly about music, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, once a performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.

At any musical event, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the talent of the musicians. A skilled singer or a flawless string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician demonstrates years of hard work. Watching top-class music performances is similar to watching athletes; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate an actor's skill and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though they frequently ask, ""How do you memorize all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often interact on more equal terms, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question arises: does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotion, humor, and intimacy. It can connect with the audience's imagination, both individually and collectively. However, traditional music presentations often emphasize a strict separation between performers and listeners, creating an uncomfortable hierarchy.

On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also interrupt the flow of the performance.

Is there a solution? Yes, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. This experience was not only musically enriching but also transformative for many audience members, who were not just spectators but also participants.

What I desire in music is more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, leading to surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in conventional ways, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.

As an enthusiastic supporter of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to flourish and for more people to enjoy the joy I find in being part of an audience."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I do not enjoy it in its natural form. To me, it is mostly an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can even swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like plaster and is hard to remove, even with a powerful hose. However, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days, you will find it mysteriously falling out of your shoes and spreading more when you take off your socks. Sand seems to linger longer than many illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.

**Lock and Key**  
The desire for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam used to secure doors has evolved into complex electronic locks that use plastic cards with countless combinations. However, the need to keep out intruders remains strong. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locking systems that use smart cards to control electronic locks. But people generally do not like these systems. While you might accept them at work, at home, most people prefer the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt anxious about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Perhaps if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, art is not meant to be analyzed like a school essay. The goal is to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. The new gallery has made an effort to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that provided context and explained the meaning behind the works. Instead of just staring at the art as I used to, these helpful details allowed me to gain a better understanding."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films often requires cutting down and simplifying the original material. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also provide new insights. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary; rather, it reflects the different ways that novels and films engage their audiences.

In novels, certain character traits are often repeated to help readers remember them, and speech tags like ""he said"" make it easier to follow conversations. In contrast, stage plays focus mainly on dialogue, which can sometimes include a lot of unnecessary language that serves only to connect the speakers without adding much meaning.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, viewers can feel completely immersed in the film's world, escaping from reality for the duration of the movie. However, once the film ends and the lights come back on, this illusion is shattered, and viewers return to their everyday lives. Many people do not feel accountable for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality can lead to a lack of serious consideration of movies as an art form. Previous generations, including our parents and teachers, often dismissed films as mere entertainment rather than art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing collection of buildings. The layout was chaotic, with only a few recognizable landmarks like the Script Department. Most rooms looked the same and were identified by a complicated system of letters and numbers, making it difficult to find specific places. The studio had three main entrances, all equally basic, which added to the confusion for newcomers. However, most people who worked there were familiar with the layout, and their teamwork brought stories of romance and adventure to life on screen.

**Film-Makers**

Many people aspire to make movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that reward aspiring filmmakers with equipment. Robert Rodriguez, for example, made his film *El Mariachi* for just $7,000, which launched his career as a prominent independent director. He reflected on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to achieve his breakthrough film before turning 26, just as famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg had done.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to gain experience over time, often working behind the scenes in roles like editing or cinematography before directing their own films. For instance, John Huston was 35 when he made *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, known for *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the backing of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to forge their own paths."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western part of the city, forming rows of small, worn-down homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, unpleasant smells from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, filled the air around the houses. A common sight in the mornings was a paperboy grimacing as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 

There are also other memories, like my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the grand mansion at Earlham. My mother appears in these early memories, and I remember her as a small, precise woman who was often angry. I never fully understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, I sensed that her personality was unusual. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was not common in our neighborhood. This sometimes led to intense spring-cleaning sessions or her telling me to ""behave properly."" I never fully grasped her moral code, which included not stepping into neighbors' gardens or risking their rose bushes while walking down the street. It also meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio shows that my mother enjoyed. There were many rules to follow.

Over time, other figures appeared in my memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends: Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that this trio was not good company. They often talked about their health problems, the weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to.

Reflecting on my childhood, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" was resting on my shoulders, and I felt it was my responsibility to break free from it. However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a predictable routine. Until the age of five, you stayed at home and bothered your parents. I remember long, aimless days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. 

After turning five, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats. My mother usually left me to walk with other children in the street. If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of life outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who shared stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and once, there was a charity event at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were just trying to take your money. 

My mother often spoke about money and had a deep disdain for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she likely imagined it as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with cash from gullible citizens. I may exaggerate her views and overlook her good qualities, but she seemed to lack kindness, as if it had been drained from her. 

To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally, on Sundays, she would take me, dressed nicely, on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms filled with paintings by local artists. Surprisingly, my mother didn’t completely dislike this outing and even began to form opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and joking, ""Well, I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was a rare moment of humor from her."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was settling in, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I was familiar with this side of the street from my childhood; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as memorable to me as the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, marking my path when I rode my roller skates or scooter. 

As the street sloped downwards, I noticed a subtle decline in the social status of the area: the porches became lower, and the front yards shrank. Over the years, changes occurred: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that felt Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, houses I once knew as homes had turned into stores, and surprisingly, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents adapted to these spaces and lived with the lingering scents of the goods that once filled them.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a former curtain warehouse. His flat has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be lifted from trains nearby. However, Gilbert did not want an empty, open space for practical and aesthetic reasons. ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was difficult to relax or focus on work with everything in view,"" he explained. To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic to separate the entrance from the office area. This design also led the eye to the kitchen, which he wanted to be a neutral space for cooking for friends or making coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with both modern furniture and sentimental pieces from his parents or markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life and writing are filled with secrets and complexities, making him a fascinating figure. He was a talented and original writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It reinvented travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the depth of great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he often altered reality to enhance his stories or to convey deeper meanings, suggesting that through travel, one could uncover rich histories meant to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created tiny fountains that burst into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain intensified, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the pool as if it were reaching for the sky. It was during this heavy rain in the summer of 1996 that I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of my routine swimming, like a tiger pacing in a cage. 

Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and interpreted, which can make reality feel less genuine. This is why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path and breaking free from conventional views. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains, that still hold their secrets."

CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We are all aware of global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it impact our lives? Most people have a basic understanding of global warming, but the specific consequences remain unclear. A warmer climate is expected to change weather patterns worldwide. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our benefit, allowing us to grow food, build cities, and support a population of six billion. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the past century, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising gas levels are likely already influencing the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes it difficult to predict future conditions accurately.

Research shows that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have varied in close relation to global temperatures over the last 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface temperature has risen by about 6°C in the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research has focused on predicting the effects of higher global temperatures. Scientists use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climatic factors interact. However, these models simplify reality and have limitations. Their predictions are only rough estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, even though we recognize its complexity.

Despite these challenges, there is a general agreement on a crucial point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. Current predictions suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels may increase by 15 to 95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns are expected. Scientists also predict that extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, will become more common in certain areas. These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on both the natural environment and human societies.

Climate change could alter the locations of ecosystems like forests and grasslands, affect the species they support, and influence their ability to provide essential resources for human survival. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. While some effects may be harmful and potentially irreversible, not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some regions may benefit from climate change. For instance, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to rising minimum temperatures that have reduced frost damage to crops.

However, many predicted effects of future warming are concerning. Even small climate changes can affect water availability, leading to shortages, especially in dry regions or areas already facing pollution issues. The Mediterranean Basin is one such example, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades. In southern Portugal, rainfall has become more concentrated in autumn and winter, reducing spring precipitation.

Another worrying effect of climate change is its impact on glaciers, which will affect ice levels and, consequently, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human infrastructure. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will completely melt, facilitating marine transport and oil exploration but also increasing the risk of icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This will occur due to the expansion of warmer ocean water and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences of rising sea levels could be severe. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, threatening cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees.

The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."
CPE_66,"**Mission to Mars**

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 kilometers above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. 

It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft may succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will help improve future missions."
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences, which complicates our understanding.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of certain artworks create established ideas that can block new perspectives. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When we separate artworks from their origins and their impact on our experiences, we create a barrier that obscures their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then exists in a separate domain, detached from the materials and goals of other human endeavors.

Therefore, anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts faces a significant challenge: to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from human experience.

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion. To truly understand artistic products, we may need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not consider aesthetic. We must take a detour to reach a deeper understanding of art. While it is possible to enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of the interactions between soil, air, water, and sunlight.

To grasp the essence of aesthetics, we must start with raw experiences—those moments and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something distant and special that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 

The arts that resonate most with the average person often do not fit traditional definitions of art. For example, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are more relatable. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the misconception that separates art from ordinary experiences. In fact, the times when unique and distinguished objects are closely linked to everyday activities are when appreciation for those objects is strongest."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a remarkable display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows, surrounding their unsuspecting prey like skilled hunters. They appear to be ideal social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, our perspective has changed. When we began our research in 1978, we aimed to understand why lions cooperate in hunting, raising cubs, and scaring off rivals with their roars. 

If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, cooperation might not always be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping others at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are experts at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, we needed various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the direction of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of melodic local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. 

The album showcased Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as versatile songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more melancholic tracks, such as ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The brilliance of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, setting a record in an era of lengthy CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who held great power in the ancient world. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life.

As an only child, I often felt lonely. When I asked to play with other kids and was turned down, my mother advised me to do something so interesting that they would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the opportunity to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that resonated with me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I refused to visit. I’m mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of others waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. This pile is usually sorted by a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are eager to find something original— the junior hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced one wants to justify their freelance work. 

If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor who champions your work must justify its acceptance based on its quality and potential sales. They also need to assess whether you, as an author, seem like a long-term investment, which you should have assured them of in your letter. Additionally, they will consider how marketable you are, as this is crucial for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising Under Pressure**

If you work in advertising, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in the economy, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, job losses for over half a million people, and many homes being repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with some sectors, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in activity. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.

While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt intense pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping their companies financially, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were expected to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. This shift led to greater recognition of marketing's value, but it also increased the workload for marketing professionals.

Marketing is often mistakenly viewed as a simple solution to problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals intensified. The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the early 1990s marked a significant downturn. This decline was partly due to the economic situation, but it also revealed deeper issues that wouldn't simply disappear when the economy improved. The recession forced companies to reassess their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies struggled to see clear returns on their advertising investments, leading to increased skepticism about its value.

As a result, companies demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best talent working on their accounts and expected outstanding results. While this situation may not inspire sympathy for the advertising industry, it meant that those still employed faced the same challenges as their clients: achieving more with less.

Several factors made effective advertising even harder to produce. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including significant demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising regulations. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising in foreign markets.

These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" The pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising has never been greater. Unfortunately, support for those looking to improve their advertising strategies is not readily available. Companies and agencies have been too busy managing these challenges to share their experiences, and those who have found success often keep their methods secret. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some insights, the available literature on advertising often fails to provide practical guidance. Many books treat the advertising process with excessive reverence, suggesting that all advertising work is of high quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for making advertising decisions."
CPE_18,"**The Allure of Cooking**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers, as cooking was not a popular career. On the surface, being a chef seems unappealing. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university; the work was difficult, and the social scene felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected a deeper appreciation for the art of cooking. I first realized this when I had a meal at a renowned restaurant in London. It was an eye-opening experience. I still remember my appetizer vividly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to kneel and weep in gratitude to the chef. I felt light and joyful for days. This inspired me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree became a distraction from my true passion. I learned about cooking in a chaotic and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The swimming instructor at my school was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he instructed me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson ended. On my next visit, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly, saying things like, ""Don't look down, look up!"" and ""Keep your legs straight!"" 

The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise around me faded, and I felt enveloped in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I landed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disdain, but even he could not take away my happiness. I thought to myself, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveler**

For those of us who value comfort, safety, and the likelihood of living a long life, the idea of a traveler can seem both strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through rough seas, and eating whatever they can find, even if it’s unappetizing. They can live for months in uncertainty. 

It is easy to see these travelers as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While their existence is undeniable, their unusual world feels far removed from our daily lives, which is why we often dismiss it. We can simply return to our comfortable lives, grateful that our risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is likely why he spends so much time on it. He does not consider himself a top sailor, but he is skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell.

Raban's small boat is equipped with a device that accurately shows his location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass harmed the connection between humans and the sea. He argues that since the compass was introduced about a thousand years ago, it has distracted sailors from observing the ocean and understanding its nature. Instead of experiencing the sea, sailors now focus on following a set course, which means they can rely on autopilot for long periods. This might be why Raban has the time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two wonderful pleasures: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books can help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books from the past or from faraway places because there are more similarities among people than differences. In the writings of others, we discover our own thoughts, feelings, and struggles. Authors can express emotions we thought we were alone in feeling, using words that capture our experiences with clarity and insight. What we find difficult to articulate is often expressed beautifully in their work, especially if it comes from someone in a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves better.

Through reading and traveling, we break free from our daily routines. Our awareness is heightened when we first arrive in a new location, just as it is when we read a powerful book that reveals things we might have overlooked before. Our minds become more attuned to the world around us, noticing the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness we didn’t realize we felt.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to restore parts cut by the editor for space, but I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only minor details that I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have been endless. For instance, in my second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer reflect my thoughts at that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in the moment, unaware of what would happen next, focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the essence of modern air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special skills for exploring it other than the price of a ticket. However, I believe my fellow travelers were not completely oblivious. Even a simple postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism terms that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first place. This term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a desire among travelers to minimize their impact while abroad. It quickly became a popular marketing term for vacations. Today, ""ecotourism"" can refer to anything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour boat ride through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of clear regulations and definitions has left many travelers confused in the vast world of ecotourism.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years, but I was lucky to find it a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn’t as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier experience than expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another and often staying for weeks. When I settled down during these long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing worth recording. I was slow to pick it up again when I moved on, and sometimes I only made brief notes instead of detailed accounts. Worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, I added many disclaimers. However, I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I allowed the story to unfold naturally without excessive caution."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought to be a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace its beginnings to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for creating various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more intricate. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly signifies today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writer**

Media reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. In my experience, which is far from being at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work full-time jobs and write in the evenings, ensuring they have financial stability even if their book is not quickly published or made into a film. Others, like me, take on various part-time jobs, such as teaching and writing articles, to get by. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Nevertheless, by balancing part-time work, using credit cards, and often relying on the kindness of those acknowledged in my work, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not performing, it was hard to leave home without being followed by enthusiastic supporters. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, innocent confidence that only those who are shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advancements are changing our lives in many areas, including music. Susan Hallam examines how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a significant increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this growth has led to a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians.

It is clear that access to music will keep expanding, as it meets many human needs. Music is essential for national events and offers many activities for individuals, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether music will exist in the 21st century, but what type of music it will be and whether people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments.

I believe that there will still be a strong interest in learning instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various careers, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, there is growing evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, a measure of intelligence. Although these findings need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might encourage transferable skills. For example, regular practice can help develop good study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can promote punctuality and organization. Therefore, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

Looking further ahead, will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres emerging that blend different styles. Second, technology will play a larger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages may want to engage in music-making, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions. To prepare for this future, the music profession must adapt. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require adjustments to the curriculum and assessment methods to stay relevant for a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be essential. They must learn to inspire and teach students of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community projects. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 

Positively, this change offers a chance for those in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to elevate the importance of music in our lives. Music is vital, yet often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should collaborate to ensure that this perception changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and disdain, often fueled by their own words during interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings about acting, they often resort to clichés and gossip. The dancer Pavlova once said, ""If I could tell you what my dance means, I wouldn't need to dance it."" This highlights how actors should focus on their craft rather than discussing it. Paul Scofield wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. Discussing it can make it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the playwright. After a performance, they often feel empty until the next role.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the transition from boyhood to manhood with simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him to a leading actor. He plays a young man filled with anger, yet he balances this with humor, making him both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting: Is it merely imitation, or does it evoke real behavior? What brings these characters to life, both morally and physically? 

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with a technique called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For instance, when the line is about queuing in the rain, they might visualize a memory of waiting in line. This helps them find the motivation to deliver the line. The director encourages actors to remain open-minded and trust that something will emerge during the rehearsal.

**The Perfect Theatre**

An ideal theatre should make the audience feel their presence matters. Attending a live performance should feel special, and the staff should share this sentiment. It can be alienating if the front-of-house staff seem indifferent. The theatre must foster a connection between performers and the audience, ensuring that viewers feel engaged and not distanced from the actors. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should accommodate the human voice and body. If the space feels too large, it detracts from the drama. Many theatres built in the late 1800s successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that carry a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, which reflect layers of human experience. 

When it comes to plays, it's impossible to please everyone. You cannot predict what the audience will want; they seek something unexpected. If a performance doesn't surprise you, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll in the 1950s**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older generations. This music influenced future rock stars, who listened to it with admiration, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be an important part of their lives. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the United States, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential for many aspiring rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Europe, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show and was ready to move from just listening to creating his own music.

**Snow Experience**

While walking in the snow, I thought I would be fine if I was careful. The strong wind pushed me down as I struggled on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow beneath me collapsed, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between two rocks, and I was surprised to find it. I managed to climb out, feeling shaken and worried about what could have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone half a mile, and it was clear that I needed to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**

Many books now offer guidance on qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. The process of data analysis can seem mysterious. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share their methods. The goal was to provide insights into qualitative data analysis rather than create a traditional guidebook for researchers. This task involves clarifying the often hidden steps in the analysis process. Although this may seem easy, we found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur, pulling the noodles up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he didn’t remember much. There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. While using new technology to teach children is fine, traditional education still plays an important role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film production had moved to Hollywood. The local residents were not happy, feeling their neighborhood in Los Angeles was being taken over by outsiders. However, they eventually accepted this change because success, measured by box office earnings, is a key American value. Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as well-known as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a small village, focused mainly on films. People there talk about movie earnings, celebrity relationships, and industry gossip. Many successful people in Hollywood try to live elsewhere while still working there. Nevertheless, it remains the main place for anyone important in show business.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and light-sensitive surfaces allowed them to create images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could achieve in a long time. This innovation surprised other artists, who initially enjoyed the new images but later claimed that photography could not be considered art. They believed that photography was too tied to reality and relied too much on mechanical processes to be a true expression of creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had developed a new art form. They used their tools to interpret the world, just as other artists have used brushes and pencils.

**Book Illustration**

During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was widely accepted that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, although the number of printed copies decreased over time. Children's publishing remained active, but it was often low-budget, leading to many average-quality works. However, the best artists consistently produced high-quality illustrations. As a result, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less impressive works, making it a great resource for research and exploration. The most valuable pieces are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that interest in this period is growing, and we may soon see new publications featuring classic children's illustrations."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Look where I am,"" you are also revealing your location to many people, some of whom you might not want to meet. This highlights a growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative consequences. 

The internet offers exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this digital world, we often find ourselves overwhelmed and lost in the chaos of sharing personal stories and photos. It can feel discouraging, but there is hope. We can learn from those who explored the internet before us—early bloggers who faced many challenges and learned valuable lessons.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a blog filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. By January 1996, he began posting daily updates, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything, and while some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the artistic quality of his work.

However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video titled ""Dark Night."" Hall revealed that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue of sharing personal information remains.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague shared her blog's address with the company's executives, including those she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. This situation illustrates what experts call the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and took a break from blogging, she eventually got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary tale of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life in a thoughtful way. 

What Armstrong teaches us is important: while the internet allows us to say anything, we should think carefully about what we choose to share."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. This growing interest in sleep focuses on its patterns, benefits, and the challenges people face in getting enough rest. A prominent sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a significant need for rest that they had been missing.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep habits as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a large screen. Participants arrive at 2 PM, during the body's natural afternoon slump, often after little or no sleep. They are asked to drive while answering questions. The simulation creates a long road with bright sunlight and warm air. Despite their confidence, many participants struggle to stay awake. Dr. Reyner has recorded one participant who tries hard not to fall asleep. Initially, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more frequently and nod off. Eventually, he falls asleep briefly, causing the car to veer off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What do we know for sure about human sleep? Like other mammals, humans follow a daily sleep cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during the lightest sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond these facts, many ideas about sleep remain uncertain. Some believe sleep helps repair the body or restore muscles, while others think it allows the brain to rest. However, it might be that relaxation while awake achieves similar benefits.

Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons for this are unclear. Some researchers even suggest that sleep allows us to ""travel through time without injury.""

Historically, sleep patterns have varied. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This break allowed time for reflection, dreaming, or even nighttime activities. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making most people work longer hours in lit buildings.

In many non-Western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. Some people go to bed for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The concept of a solid night's sleep is not universal. In certain tribal societies, sounds from humans and animals, along with the need to tend to fires and watch for predators, make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people worldwide are in great need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about very impressive cowboy boots—really expensive ones. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert. Money was not a concern. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might be seen as a cowboy. But I was not one. It just didn’t feel right. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I did not belong there. 

I had flown in from Denver just after dawn, thinking I might blend in as a cowboy arriving from the sky. That thought disappeared quickly when I saw a real cowboy in the luggage area of Phoenix airport. He wore a sweat-stained shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty bag off the conveyor belt. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and walked out without looking back.

I thought there should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. Something that would make me feel comfortable wherever I went, without the sense that everyone else was moving at a slower pace. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But I no longer race, and I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 

I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have a few backup identities ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. I considered becoming a commentator for races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me for that role. I also thought about starting a business selling classic cars, but that didn’t work out either. The market was slow, and I decided to step back before losing everything.

Being an ""ex"" anything can be disheartening. Who really wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to hear the story for a few minutes before losing interest. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. 

I don’t want sympathy, which is good because I don’t receive any. Why should I? I had a successful career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car, feeling the seven hundred horsepower behind me. I miss the excitement of going from zero to one hundred fifty miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing, where I often came close to serious accidents. 

I miss the vibrant people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. Being somewhat famous had its perks; businessmen and politicians would brag about knowing me, and young fans would sneak under fences for my autograph. Now that I no longer race, my phone hardly rings. I have plenty of free time in the mornings and afternoons. 

I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying overhead—maybe Arizona doesn’t have them. But I noticed a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby, warning me to stay away from their nest. I had never thought the desert could have songbirds. It struck me that a fake cowboy in designer boots still had much to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents enjoy walking through the streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like myself, often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best impact in our work, which makes writing a letter feel less spontaneous. True creative artists, who may rewrite their work many times, do not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not consciously think about how the use of longer words made them powerful and showcased his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big deal. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, making celebrity appearances less necessary. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open a store for free? Last week, while waiting, older people didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. A rumor spread that the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news made those at the front feel proud, while those who arrived late felt envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the potential backlash from William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite positive reviews, the film did not do well at the box office. It was only when it was shown on television that it regained popularity. *Citizen Kane* is often seen as a film that has motivated many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went for it. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who resembled Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he embraced the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t fully understand. “Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.

**Title Race**

Do you mind if I call myself a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator? Human nature often leads to amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more appealing or professional job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overshadows our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator), but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually my main reason for being anywhere. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I was always inspired by how light fell on different surfaces. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I lived by the idea that I might take the perfect photo at any moment, as long as I had film in my camera. I would finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open for opportunities. This had been my approach for a long time.

Once, I took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular, and suddenly everyone wanted it. It was a brief moment of fame, mostly due to luck. They say you create your own opportunities, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed like a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I didn’t mind.

My assignment in Vienna came about by chance. I had previously taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showcasing the beauty of places like Hyde Park and Piccadilly. However, I knew that much of my work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not something meant to challenge people’s views.

After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me his position because they liked my work and I was available, unlike other photographers. I was eager to go, as things were not going well for me at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded like a welcome change.

They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy summer trip with my wife, where we rushed through many sights and I hardly took any photos. This time, alone in the cold of January, I felt it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs, I knew I would enjoy my time there and take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to let it reveal itself to me. 

Photography is about capturing moments, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The overnight snow made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while its massive base dominated the city. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always held a sense of magic, even for those who first discovered it in the 19th century, before the science behind it was fully understood. You can watch a blank sheet of paper transform into a photograph in a dark room, and even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in the way I expected."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed from a serious place into one full of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 

Curator Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying kinetic art, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers a break from everyday life. Some might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and clever comments, rather than his art itself. This raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks depth? Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. However, one could argue that his popularity today is seen as a negative, rather than a sign that his work lacks value. Hockney is aware of his own limitations and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.

**Window-Shopping: An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, it highlights a questionable angle or forced concept. This led me, as a curator, to create a show that opposes this idea. Along with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse space. ""Window-shopping"" was meant to showcase individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. 

For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats playfully chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opening it up and poking around until it broke, creating a flickering display on a monitor. These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other in their contrast. I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is fundamentally an individual activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of simply looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. 

Moreover, pleasure is complex. How we sense and recognize pleasure is influenced by our history and society. Our preferences for certain characteristics in art are shaped not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. While we should not underestimate the importance of instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as a substitute for thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been drawn to metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow pebble and picked it up. This pebble felt different from stone and was attractive. This could be how gold first became important to primitive people. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, adding to the skills that improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We struggled to carry our bags down the narrow, cobbled street leading to the town center, bent over against the strong wind and trying to avoid the icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and every cottage by the water had its shutters tightly closed against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark skies closing in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to join me with the promise of beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who thrived during peaceful times and struggled during hardships are no longer alive. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot rewind time to see what happened. However, computer modeling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities—digital representations that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change factors like rainfall or population size and observe how these virtual cultures and their artificial inhabitants respond."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male who noticed a strange male nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could threaten the dominant male's position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that sounded like a warning for a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The dominant male repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, he made a mistake by calling out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items, leading a professor in America to estimate that all cats in Britain might kill around 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey shows that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, who care for them deeply. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping near their owners, slowly make their way to the distant reed beds. They often groan about their tiredness before the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are so slow that they go unnoticed, but eventually, they swim, appearing almost submerged. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles. Despite their situation, the fish look alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater feel. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including the scales and a chain around one fish, add a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been a powerful tool for capturing all aspects of human life. This relatively short period has seen photography evolve, allowing us to see both fleeting moments and vast landscapes. It has provided images from far-off places, distant parts of our solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most significant ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest known visual records date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We may not know the exact reasons for early cave paintings—whether they depicted real hunting events, served as magic to attract animals, acted as religious symbols, or were simply created for enjoyment—but these images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise an automatic and truthful visual record. The camera was seen as a tool that worked like the human eye, capturing images that closely resembled what we see in reality. The chemical process used to fix these images allowed for the documentation of natural phenomena.

At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long struggled to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. In 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could comprehend a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural boundaries. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as language is? Has our familiarity with photographs led us to overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? Photography is often seen as a convincing form of evidence, making it easy to confuse our perception of the world with its photographic representations. For instance, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change can be partly attributed to photography moving into what might be called ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the society that created them as they do about their subjects.

I aim to demonstrate that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can inspire social and political change. For example, the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century were closely linked to the development of perspective in visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a crucial role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, one wrong move can lead to confusion. Instead of pretending to know everything, I suggest that beginners focus on reading a lot, writing frequently, and letting their imagination flow in a way that feels right, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some write on a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify something. A memory from the main character can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different perspectives quickly, keeping the reader engaged. Avoiding excessive writing is crucial; however, being concise doesn’t mean the story should feel incomplete. A short story should maintain conflict and action just like a novel, but every word must be meaningful in a limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Many chess players make mistakes throughout the game. We may not know everything, but we understand enough to play. We can sometimes predict a few moves ahead, which feels rewarding. As we improve at chess, we realize that it’s more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies. The more we practice, the more we understand the complexities of both chess and screenplay writing.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally communicate, as seen in how children talk. However, no child instinctively knows how to write. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human ability, writing is not. All cultures have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily improve. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. A group of children is unlikely to create an alphabet on their own. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but learning to write is a skill that requires effort and guidance. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don’t know what else to name it. I have a small story to share, and it does not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my readers hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about his life in between our meetings. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I prefer to share only what I know.

To protect the identities of living people, I have given the characters in this story made-up names and taken care to ensure they cannot be recognized. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that his unique way of life and his strong, kind character will influence others, and long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life may find useful information in my book.

I believe my book will be a helpful resource for anyone writing about my friend. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what was important to me. Although I have put these conversations into my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians do by creating dialogue for characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be dull if simply told. I want my book to be engaging, and I think I am justified in making it readable. A thoughtful reader will notice where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.

Another reason I feel uneasy about this work is that the people I discuss come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know someone, and I believe we can only fully understand our own countrymen. People are shaped not only by who they are but also by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. All these experiences shape a person, and you cannot learn them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only understand if you are part of that culture. Because you can only know people from a different nation through observation, it is challenging to portray them convincingly in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general approach. You can give broad descriptions and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are viewed, like my main character, through my perspective."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important figures in retrospect. Currently, the poetry scene is particularly complex, with many different styles, groups, and opinions about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught, as well as the poet's role in society.

In general, the main discussion in contemporary poetry is about the distrust between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in various forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community spaces or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students; and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.

The impact of these events, where poets must perform publicly, is varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is designed for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood quickly; however, their weaknesses become apparent when read on the page. In contrast, dedicated poets, who strive to create deep and intricate works, may not be appreciated by audiences hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their easiest pieces, which may not represent their best work.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to place emphasis. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or is familiar with the poems beforehand. 

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes combined with music (like jazz), is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a straightforward account of their past. In an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and shares their experiences. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status and their understanding of history, which may also affect the informant's perspective. Thus, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from their childhood. The emotions and attitudes expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they might reflect later experiences rather than the actual time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, studying how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who take the whole animal approach look at the behavior of animals in their entirety and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors of animals in the wild. Although these distinctions still exist, there is now a beneficial merging of the two fields. Physiologists often claim their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. Behavior has its own structure and units that must be considered. For example, explaining a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students beginning to study social sciences face a dual challenge. They must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the logical framework of the subject. These two aspects are interconnected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own concepts. These fundamental ideas form the logical basis of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, suggesting his definitions were influenced by earlier Greek thinkers whose works are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best designs for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art form. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple constructions, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures were not artistic, they contributed essential elements that influenced later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, even jumping over a small bridge, which was her only mistake. After driving past the gasworks, which smelled of sulfur, Chen found out and was amused. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip on a Monday next month, the quietest day of the week. They decided to leave early and return by noon to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving.

Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills. Within an hour of leaving home, they were at the English Channel. Lily drove very well, even overtaking some slow cars, which made Chen applaud. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street with empty spaces, unsure about the road signs, so she chose to pay for parking to avoid any trouble.

Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the mirror and decided not to add to her worries. She locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were offended. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to see the sea. He held his son close, and in that moment, he decided to raise him to be successful, focusing on education and business.

As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of emotions and began to plan Man Kee's future. He noticed a trail of smoke on the horizon and then saw a ship shimmering in the sunlight. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. After some effort, he finally spotted it—a rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope and said, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It’s special for people like us. It may look old, but it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee was reluctant to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I once read that if you dig deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, balanced it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t consider that the bucket would be heavier, or that you might not be strong enough or willing to just let things happen. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket away from the well's edge. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, confusing and odd. Later, I connected these lights to the cartoon stars I had seen when characters got hurt. Initially, I felt dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall, worried about what Mother would say. 

You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but your rising panic stopped me. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. After a moment, I quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices from the castle's main door. I ran away, hiding in the shadows by the moat bridge. Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming, waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I crouched in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. 

Then I noticed the drops of dirty well water I had left behind, forming a small pool at my feet. I looked back at the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had noticed them. Mother was now screaming in a way I had never heard before, and it shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but things had become more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank quickly turned into a situation that would lead to serious consequences, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 

Suddenly, an idea came to me like a lifeline. I gathered my courage and stepped out of my hiding place, staggering and blinking. I called out softly, then louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then dramatically fell onto the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. I said the secret passage had collapsed after me, so there was no point in looking for it. I claimed the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 

Looking into my father's eyes felt like staring into a dark tunnel with no light. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing the world from an adult's perspective. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, his tone full of contempt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his expression sad and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved, but because he could see through my desperate lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, confirming that my actions and my father's judgment were serious, affecting me even more deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The moving van was labeled 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed all the fragile items with his large hands, while his team worked less gently. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was particularly focused on making sure Susan didn’t mention the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, helping in her usual bossy way, convinced that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred commented, ""She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry."" Susan was curious, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You’d be surprised. They seem happy while we’re loading the van, but then they start crying in an empty room. They’re fine once we reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""

Susan could understand that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the best room of the house, and they planned to move it last.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, and little Robert watched in awe while Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture, and the next day, a builder removed the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed, and the piano was carefully lifted through the window while the children cheered.

However, the whole process was expensive, and it took months before they could afford to have the piano tuned. Peter had said, ""That’s there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house.

As she thought about the stairs, she noticed the banister rails were still not perfectly aligned. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late now. She felt dazed and panicked. Fred asked, ""Are you all right? Just the piano left, and then we’ll be done."" She stepped away from the stairs, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch.

Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Truthfully, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless items that seemed unimportant while they were in place now felt full of emotion, and she almost cried.

Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out, and they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. 

Fred asked, ""What’s the joke?"" but his question only made them laugh more. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that truly became accessible to everyone: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 

Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, helping potential buyers see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical locations, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced many challenges. With thousands of reviews submitted daily, it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors ensured that reviews followed Amazon's rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that contained offensive language, revealed endings, or referenced other reviews were also banned. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, inappropriate reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This created opportunities for mischief.

For instance, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several anonymous positive reviews to counteract them. His trick worked until he revealed his deception in an article, after which the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this feature to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not verify that these comments were genuinely from the authors, except for well-known writers.

The real drama often came from readers, not authors. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received praise from the press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon saw the high level of engagement from readers as beneficial for business. 

Amazon aimed to keep reviews focused on discussing books rather than casual chatting. They paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One long review even compared the book's plot to Internet architecture, claiming it provided a good overview of networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare.

Most reviewers on Amazon took their contributions seriously. Overall, the reviews offered a surprisingly accurate idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing feelings about books he didn't care about. This highlights why making literary criticism accessible to everyone is a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these views for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to constantly surprise us. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes, techniques, and qualities that are still present in modern art.

We expect artists to be different from ordinary people, possessing special talents and energy that break free from conventions. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and often become frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist selects a text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This may seem simplistic, but bear with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in a simple style, without any decoration. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in plain black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: is this finished piece a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it is often met with disappointment. I am not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer to take safe risks, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different, and it will be interesting to see if he succeeds. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world, resulting in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the intriguing beauty of this hidden environment.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only someone unwell would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I exist in a state of reflection. I mentioned the futility of art but did not speak of its comforting aspects. The true comfort of my work lies in the ability to reshape reality through art. Our everyday actions often hide deeper meanings. For artists, art offers a joyful way to confront the struggles of daily life, allowing us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we cause each other pain?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Listen, this isn't good!"" my dad said. We were driving back to London after he picked me and my trunk up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the award for the best results in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking since he was unusually quiet. Normally, he was very talkative. ""You can't trick me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford."" 

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Couldn’t that be useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My dad knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I’m not so sure about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn’t in the family business anymore. You’ll go to Oxford, and after that, I can’t see you wanting to join us."" 

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my family's expectations. I saw many career options and wanted to explore them. But, like a coward, I didn’t want to upset my dad. I wasn’t as scared of him as my brother Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 

""It’s too early to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you won’t want to join us,"" my dad said, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It’s a shame because you have the talent—the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 

""There’s still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My dad scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my dad raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and since he was motherless, I took care of him. It wasn’t a burden; I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a large house in London, attended good schools, wore nice clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My dad knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and businesspeople—and our home was always lively with great conversations. 

""I have an idea,"" my dad said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the sadness my dad would feel if I disagreed. This was how he controlled us. 

So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 

In my last term, my dad visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 

But then my dad told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the most significant one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It’s really important that I do well, and I don’t want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell my dad didn’t understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined he was—the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and self-control. In his way, he was a genius, and I admired that in him. It made my own dreams seem less significant. 

""Alright,"" I said. ""I’ll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. A home that requires strict budgeting is often not worth the cost. At the time, however, it seemed like a smart and appealing choice. Simon had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly advocated for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate living quarters for an au pair. They could have found these in a less trendy area of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra room. Mornington Mansions was not a fitting address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel it lowered her social and economic status.

Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube rides became a frustrating thirty minutes of resentment and reflection on their problems. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a child, remembering the comforting smells of dinner and his grandmother's care for her husband after a long day in court. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and present at all events, seemingly happy in her role. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which relied on two incomes. Now, their fragile situation could be threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a furious mood, clearly upset by something.

Simon regretted not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened, and Venetia could have had time to calm down. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. She had defended Brian Cartwright that day, who claimed that when Simon was his lawyer four years ago, he knew about jury bribing and did nothing. Simon denied it, but his response felt weak even to him. He felt guilty, and the shame of being caught in a lie washed over him. He had looked into Venetia's eyes and seen her disbelief. He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then or now."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she recognized it. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who appointed Venetia as the moral judge of their legal practice? Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if rumors spread, it could mean the end for him."
CPE_36,"I chose to live in this place because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented homes were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me, even if I try to stay hidden. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some herbs to make room for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. My garden is small, so the plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive.

“Looks like you’ve been cleaning up,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished stories, and sometimes I have to pretend to know about them as part of my job as an English teacher. I have her latest story with me now. “How’s the writing going, Jaz?” I ask. “Honestly, in no other job do people have to explain themselves so many times a day,” she replies, then adds, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in my garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. She knocks on my door. “So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you.” She sits in my chair while I place a cushion on what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, pretending to be young. “I should’ve become a teacher—writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither.

“So, what are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel overwhelmed by the empty days ahead. Hot sidewalks covered in gum, walks to the shops, and sitting alone in the park. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” My heart races as I ask. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were kids.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction.

“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my story?” Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always delivering gifts to others while ignoring her. I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you some advice,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change—people who want to be good. A little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say, sounding a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal? Nice people? Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She once winked at us and said, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly laughed ourselves to death."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel linked to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us make sense of our individual and national futures. Heritage fulfills our desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. While there may be aspects of our national heritage that we do not agree with, it is still a part of who we are, and it is comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. 

In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, modern society has disrupted many communities and families, leading to a loss of this oral tradition. Now, we often rely on historical places and architecture to understand our past. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became significant. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens appealing because they seemed like a blank canvas for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not just flat and empty; they are rich in character and strangely beautiful. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other unique areas have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. 

While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict factual accuracy. However, trying to envision the Fens has its own logic, as they are not just a landscape but also a state of mind, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should offer more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, similar materials have been made available to help elderly people with memory loss.

Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is their strength and sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that museums uniquely offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve our surroundings is not new, but the rapid changes in our towns affect us all. This can lead some people to become passionate preservationists while encouraging others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that those who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily negative if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely mention Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, such as computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being difficult to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to contradict everyday experiences. Einstein was a key figure in a major shift in scientific thought, marking the beginning of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians aimed to develop a new, more logical understanding of the universe by examining the connections between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basic concepts of time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier theories were based on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed framework of space and time. Einstein challenged this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

As children, Lydia and I were skeptical of any book that won awards because we associated 'worthy' with 'boring'. Our mother often criticized our lack of appreciation for good literature, while our father would reward us with small coins for reading certain books. He would also include a few quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, clearly marked as 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter, quality fiction and, on one occasion, to a well-known collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the origin of human language is both secret and wonderful. This intriguing idea has led to many unusual theories. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is quite sad. Early humans, who lived in dangerous environments filled with fierce animals, likely made desperate sounds, and some of these sounds have influenced the words we use today, such as 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" and the Latin word 'mors' meaning ""death"". Many people avoided discussing the origins of language, viewing it as a topic for odd theories. However, in recent years, the study of how language began and evolved has become an important area of research. Language likely developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and played a crucial role in power dynamics. The exchange of information was probably not its primary purpose, which contrasts with philosopher John Locke's idea of language as a major means of sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who practices it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they only remain relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including the writers themselves, believe that reviewing is not a desirable job and is often done out of necessity, such as needing money or because writers cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review of fifteen hundred words in a weekly magazine combines challenges from both short and long formats. Length is not the only factor to consider; the reviewer must also think about their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.

Additionally, a reviewer needs to have a broad knowledge base and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of content. For example, the American novelist John Updike, who is somewhat critical of criticism, still engages in reviewing while writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how brief, into books with modest titles.

Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they wish to have a lasting record of their work, especially if they feel that some of their best writing is found in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own writing. My main work has been academic, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.

In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The stigma that once existed among academics regarding professors who wrote reviews has diminished. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are also less frequent, partly because there are now more reviewing opportunities available for everyone.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and for professors, reviewing helps maintain their mental well-being. It also serves as a reminder that they should communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may feel the need to use complex language among themselves, they must ensure they are understandable when addressing a broader audience.

Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary activity. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in another primary pursuit."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, curious about what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming space where he could focus without distractions. He knew he should worry about possible intruders or leaks, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He grew frustrated with its inability to change.

There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine sometimes blinked to life when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been violently disturbed, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if it had been. From his dreary office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office and starting his bus ride home, he no longer wanted to be alone, even though he often craved solitude while at his desk. The relief of escaping work left him feeling empty, making him question who he really was. 

He would read or listen to music at night, but he began to wonder for whom he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, but he had been so eager to find something meaningful that he had followed the first opportunity that came his way. After university, he tried to plan for a better future, but he found that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, feeling like he was trailing behind them, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work.

He attended one job interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the position—a vague editorial role at a local free newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his potential boss, and didn’t consider the long-term implications of the job. Neil offered him the position on the spot, mentioning that he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was set up for the race, not as formal as traditional racecourses, but similar in that spectators lined both sides of a path where the goats would run. It was challenging to keep a few selected goats in line, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there were no places to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs, and our flashlight batteries were dying. We replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light was just the moon reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone in this. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to achieve."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they require their own time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. However, if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of ""thinking fast"" for quick results can be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different modes of thinking work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds in the mind. 

The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body and mind quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. Musicians and athletes also rely on this quick, instinctive intelligence, which we can call our ""wits.""

The second speed involves actual thinking. This is the intelligence that requires reasoning, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic diagnosing a car issue, a scientist analyzing results, or a student working on an assignment all use this logical thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel in these areas are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and contemplative. In this mode, we might daydream or reflect deeply. For instance, sitting on a beach, listening to the waves, or drifting between sleep and wakefulness puts us in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster ones. Allowing our minds to wander is essential, especially when life becomes more demanding. We need this ""tortoise mind"" as much as the ""hare brain.""

Some everyday problems are better approached with a slower mindset. Complex issues often require a relaxed and open mental attitude. Research shows that patient, less deliberate thinking is particularly effective for understanding complicated situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems, like planning a holiday. But when the situation is unclear or subtle, we need to engage our tortoise mind. 

For example, if we are trying to manage a difficult team at work or considering a career change, it may be wiser to take time to reflect rather than rush for answers. This slower intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and have sought to nurture these slower, deeper ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these less deliberate modes of thought. The field of cognitive science is uncovering how the unconscious mind can effectively tackle complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complicated situations, and resolve difficult issues more successfully than our active intellect."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, and weather experts, all living closely together and helping each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but I struggle with casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings in discussions, and my phrasebook doesn’t help much during breakfast. While this isn’t a practical issue, it did affect my confidence at first. I felt nervous about mealtimes, unsure of which table to sit at, and I dreaded the silence that followed when I spoke. I felt anxious, similar to how I felt during my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes from losing the social confidence I used to have, which was based on my ability to communicate well.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he didn’t pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and would greet me politely when we met, but he didn’t seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to view me more positively. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he didn’t care about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t the message or the performances that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the film itself, regardless of their cultural background. He thought that if a film is made well, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock was very clear and logical in his self-assessment. He was a rational man and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing audiences react strongly. He didn’t engage in speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn’t explore his characters deeply. His focus was on the film itself and the precise, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have transformed how we create almanacs and charts, analyze observations, and publish results. This might be considered the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you may need to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Society is facing a problem of ""overchoice."" There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. In today’s economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products are constantly being introduced, making it hard to keep up. This can lead to confusion, stress, and a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in the new economy, having too many choices can create more stress, less time, and more complexity. As a result, people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a time of excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and calling plans.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a unique group of guests at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants that is often mistaken for equality today. I also find it annoying when waiters act overly friendly, as if they are trying too hard to be casual. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, allowing us to maintain our dignity and privacy, which is rare in commercial places these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
A remarkable production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London, giving me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I underestimated his acting. While I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is exceptional. Notable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers that become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pacing and tension throughout the play are excellent. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life is absent. The exception is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms may exist there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For the past two years, researchers worldwide have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we may soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard an interesting discussion on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to pursue science; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all understand the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to comprehend everything from atoms to black holes. However, these scientists want to explore why we have this desire for knowledge in the first place and why science cannot explain this motivation. I believe it is more important to determine whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in discussions about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Our connection with food is fundamental and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you simply chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boil them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-packaged soup. Instead of purchasing a sugary chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a delightful dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your creations, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our essential human needs, which is why we celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary, nor would many want to discuss business over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy his office, but papers were still scattered everywhere. Tax forms and other documents filled his desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson viewed him as someone from a different world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire inspired her to create her own story, one of uniqueness and strength. In her personal narrative, there were key moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she feared she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, leaving her with just a few stitches that healed into a reminder of her past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, Karen realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was hurrying back to her work across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is thrilling to be the first to learn something important, especially in a small community where life can be quiet. However, she was also deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's illness. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk and that he genuinely wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made him beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, earning him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist, but she has also started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are exciting and impressive, captivating even those who are not musically inclined. Recently, during a concert for kids, a small boy asked her if she could play ""Match of the Day."" This surprised many experienced musicians, but Joanna found it amusing. She realized that, in the boy's eyes, she had to play that song to prove she was a real pianist. 

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how children learn music. She has just published a beginner's piano book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" despite her busy schedule filled with concerts and collaborations. She believes that the first lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on training exceptional talent, but Joanna thinks that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way.

Her own experiences have shaped her views. From ages 18 to 25, before her concert career took off, she taught many beginners. Growing up, she was surrounded by children of all backgrounds who wanted to play different types of music. She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. 

Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage of learning. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like those they see on television. Joanna worries that some parents use music as a way to push their children to achieve, rather than letting them enjoy it. 

When asked if she thinks poorly of other piano teaching methods, Joanna is careful not to criticize. She acknowledges that her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones available to help beginners. To make learning fun, she includes stories in her books and CDs. She believes that learning should be enjoyable and encourages children to improvise and explore the piano.

As children progress, they need to learn to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear when she was younger. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. She encourages children to play pieces multiple times and to set clear goals for their practice sessions. 

Joanna has great empathy for those who struggle with practice. She suggests that whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, it’s essential to know what you want to achieve. She also recommends rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that writing that comes easily is usually not enjoyable to read. In contrast, good writing often requires effort. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent writing by hand. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, the rise of emails has revived the art of love letters, with millions now being sent instead of just casual messages. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meanings. Words typed quickly can lack the thoughtfulness and personality of handwritten notes.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed the disc to him carefully. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound lifeless, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to flip them over like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be playable to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just flip it by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let’s get you seated in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn’t answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point. He said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations, and this attitude is a form of egotism, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly fade away. So far, that has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read thoroughly. Some tech enthusiasts argue that this quick reading leads to new storytelling methods. However, the idea of reading non-linearly is not new; many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a complete text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and found it perfectly organized. The carpet was clear of the papers that had once covered it, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby’s auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their correct drawers, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room's antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any mechanical devices, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-based giftedness, inspired by her. She could easily manipulate software to create something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact, as she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot details because he usually wasn't supposed to be there. However, he had started coming in all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker struggling to keep up with everything, including finding a parking spot in the mornings.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" with ""An Expanded Synopsis"" underneath. Lancelot was not pleased to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already read a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot first bought the company. Ian was one of several friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian's unpredictable nature had only become more pronounced after Lancelot's investment.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and had a tone that suggested lost confidence. Lancelot recalled stories of a famous author whose last book was published posthumously, written chapter by chapter, with payments made along the way. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, contradicting the principle that authors must deliver a manuscript before receiving payment.

Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge, a place buzzing with potential. Ian's peers had aimed to dominate British theatre and had succeeded quickly. However, Ian seemed less motivated. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented individuals found success, Ian withdrew further. Even at the peak of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he wasted the budget for many issues without producing anything. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to rumors about his high pay, which increased in attempts to make him produce more, then even more to get him to produce anything at all.

At editorial meetings, Ian would criticize others' ideas sharply. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was beginning to accept that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively recent development in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

By the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they often overlook other significant social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal first thing in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual elements based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. Throughout this book, we will explore how these factors shape the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers interpret these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may understand the photographs printed on the page without questioning them. However, we might ask if the photograph truly represents the scene as it was or if it reflects the photographer's perspective. Is the specific moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a broader situation in the world?  

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports have always meant more than just playing a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal, putting everything else aside. The world of sports is tough, and no one will achieve success for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport encourages individual excellence while being a team effort, and balancing these two aspects is crucial. This mirrors life: you can achieve personal success, but you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just financially. They have opened doors and provided experiences that many will never have. However, you must also sacrifice a lot to gain these rewards.  

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have insomnia; it was the bird's amazing song that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I was drawn into a surprising artistic experience. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I relied on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel as if I was enjoying an incredible live performance filled with stunning improvisation. I reacted with joy and amazement as each unexpected musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds, whether we love, fear, or admire them. But what does this reveal about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of warning or prophecy. Is it trying to send a message from a mysterious world, or is it simply trapped? Depending on how you look at it, both interpretations could be valid. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Although some old beliefs may have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and lacking. 

This connection likely comes from a rich tradition of stories and beliefs about birds that dates back to when people were more in tune with nature for their survival. As people relied on the natural world, they developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, these beliefs can change over time, affecting how we view different animals. 

Take the red kite, for example. In the early 1500s, visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take food from children. These birds were appreciated as helpful scavengers. But soon, they were seen as pests and nearly disappeared from most areas, except Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation and were reintroduced to help them thrive again. 

Our connection with birds goes back to our evolution. Early humans likely observed birds closely because their behavior could signal danger, bad weather, or food availability. Birds also offered a link to the supernatural. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The ability to fly, sing, and be free captivates us and reflects our own identity in relation to nature. 

Some may think these feelings are outdated, remnants of our past. But like certain body parts that we no longer need, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be painful. This is why, in recent years, birds have become indicators of environmental change, highlighting ecological health. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered, which is troubling not only because we are losing these beautiful creatures but also because it represents a significant cultural loss. 

Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize different kinds of love and magic. Anyone familiar with the works of poets like Shelley or Shakespeare will feel a sense of loss for these once-common birds. However, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 

Folklore is crucial. The stories and legends that endure over time create a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms do. This connection evokes emotions and attitudes that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we find in these experiences cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to express, and the stories we share about them help us understand their significance. 

The wren in the greenhouse symbolizes a link between our present and a distant past, holding onto its song as it moves into the future—a mystery that keeps us intrigued."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The main purpose of a map is to visually show how different points and features on the Earth's surface relate to each other, based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions were more about how easy it was to travel through the local area than about the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the key questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written directions were just as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not always show true directions. 

Initially, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their significance. The way maps were made varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding the specific style used in early maps is essential. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included on maps. 

To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. The understanding of astronomy and exploration helped map the known world. Astronomers later discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, required accurate maps to understand the terrain for military purposes. This need led to the creation of contour maps. Other professionals, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific mapping needs. To meet these demands, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use.

The current appreciation for maps in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival in cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of mapping has not always been smooth or straightforward. There have been times of decline or stagnation, interrupted by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often recognized the need for improvement but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it is easier to create a map by copying an existing one, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be taken at face value as evidence of current knowledge and techniques.

The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought, making them a valuable record for studying human history. This aspect is what makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Tim Rice**

I entered the young man's drawing room, which was a calm and cultured space amidst a chaotic collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour felt like upgrading from economy to business class. This room held the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and the surprising fact that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months to spare before starting, during which he aimed to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star, motivated by the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, unlike Andrew, my dreams were not life-or-death matters, although they might have felt that way if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new, ambitious goal for me—to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein—I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the wider world. I had little to offer in return, except for my immediate praise for his music and a genuine seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded just three months earlier, ending their struggling career. We parted ways, promising to meet again and collaborate. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre very soon. Even if we didn’t manage to compete with the top musical composers, we could aim to outshine the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material.

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the brief excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups looking for a vocalist and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t highlight my vocal limitations. However, it was likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I turned twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, just as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This thought worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be enjoyable to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that mimicked musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. Soon, I was back in his drawing room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages that carry his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn’t truly inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the concept felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, *Oliver*. However, Andrew's strong belief in the brilliance of his music was contagious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, famously said, if there’s a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often provided the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried his hand at it. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be ill, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply integrated into human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This suggests that people naturally know how to communicate, similar to how spiders instinctively know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in construction.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can significantly shape landscapes. For instance, warm and humid conditions year-round support the growth of tropical rainforests, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy regions can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases surrounds a spinning Earth. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but more importantly, I was responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever expected about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I might be assigned to less important tasks again. Fortunately, my boss was understanding. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop the skill."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are ideal for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that successfully capture the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A notable example is Robert Hughes's eight-part series, *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a captivating personality, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to a style of art that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which aligns well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, leading to a decrease in the cost of raw materials. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry; there are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here, and Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches extend for 200 miles, resembling a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay also shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is buzzing with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire leading the way. However, many cyclists find the prices too high, with ready-made bamboo frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This inspired James and Ian to spend years developing a more affordable option in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to not only sell bike frames but also share the joy of making something unique and sustainable.

Now, the Bamboo Bike Club offers monthly courses that provide a computer-designed custom bike frame and a fun weekend experience. James and Ian both have full-time jobs—James works on wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer—but they are passionate about their project.

On the first day of the course, participants learn how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. They start by assembling the front triangle using 40 mm diameter bamboo, then move on to the thinner parts for the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other components that need extra strength. This process requires careful cutting and technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help, ensuring everyone is doing well.

Many participants are engineers, which makes the self-building aspect appealing. Ian reassures everyone that mistakes are normal, and with bamboo, it’s easy to try again since each piece is checked for quality. Participants can choose the look of their frame, whether plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, the focus shifts to building the lugs, which involves wrapping hemp bindings around the joints and using epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without any issues.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional frames, they are unique. James and Ian emphasize that individuality is part of the charm. Personally, I prefer a more relaxed bike for casual rides, so I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth experience. 

I took James’s bike for a ride, and it felt light and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes the real joy of these workshops comes when the bikes are on the road. They are light and fun to ride, and the best part? The cost is under £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first encountered a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She immediately recognized that the title would make it a bestseller, and she was correct. Dr. Gray has since become very wealthy, and Diane has started her own company. Dr. Gray's book, which discusses how to improve communication between men and women, has become a symbol of a growing self-help industry that aims to fulfill many Americans' desires for self-improvement. However, this industry also creates new desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, it has been noted that this genre can produce many questionable and dramatic books, but there are even worse examples. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too niche. This is a blessing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing often takes a backseat to marketability. Key questions include: ""How marketable is the author? What is the unique angle? Is it relatable to a wide audience?"" Diane notes that a catchy title can significantly increase the chances of success.

**Autobiographies**  
There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth will be shared. However, this agreement is often not fully honored. Writers may choose to omit certain actions or thoughts they find too embarrassing or unimportant. There are also more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. An autobiographer might believe that the essence of their story can be better conveyed through invented tales rather than strict facts. Alternatively, they may decide from the start not to adhere to the truth, labeling their work as an autobiography to gain the reader's trust, even if the story is fictional. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective fiction suggest that this genre reflects the societal conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often symbolizes deeper human desires, such as lust or greed, and its resolution represents the restoration of order in society. In Hammett's unique approach, the return to order reveals the underlying corruption of society. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same character. They understand each other and share a strange comfort. The detective straddles both worlds: too honest for the criminals and too shady for the law. His mission is complicated by his awareness of this duality, which can either soften his approach or intensify his desire for justice.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his craft, I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt entirely comfortable in such a pretentious setting. Gould remarked that he could not write in such an environment, unlike authors like Trollope, who understood the culture. He emphasized that understanding the culture is crucial for successful writing. Science is its own world, and only those within it can effectively communicate its ideas. If a writer does not belong to this community, they will struggle. One of Gould's key principles is to never underestimate the reader. He advises against simplifying arguments, stating that while language can be made easier to understand, the core ideas must remain intact. If readers feel patronized, the writing loses its impact."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it feels almost like the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks improved, sundials became mere garden decorations—charming but outdated in our technological world. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint with the same speed I had seen before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another flight. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure didn’t mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they didn’t question their right to the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, when they learned they would be staying there for their entire holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""And we can take a boat to Interlaken."" 

Keith calmly told the receptionist, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I don’t know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you want to change now—"" 

""We haven’t changed our minds. There’s been a mistake,"" Keith said firmly. The receptionist shook his head, unaware of any mistake. 

""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache,"" Dawne added, naming the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said cheerfully. She was the stout woman Keith had seen at Gatwick. On the plane, she had walked up and down the aisle, smiling at everyone. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We’re in the wrong hotel."" 

Mrs. Franks repeated the name of the travel agency and described the bald clerk. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we joined the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left everything to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover,"" Dawne added, mentioning they heard them talking about Darlington. Keith wished she would let him speak. 

""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" Keith said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 

""I noticed you too. I counted you, although you probably didn’t see me. Let me explain: Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many different holidays at various prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 

""What I’m trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course, that couldn’t happen."" 

""We’re not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let’s see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn’t listening. He replayed everything in his mind: handing the tickets to the girl, waiting, the girl leading them to the plane, and the pilot welcoming them aboard. 

""Nice to have some young people here,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith’s thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife, looking as if she were in her eighties, said they had the best night’s sleep due to the lakeside air. 

""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn’t mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they found themselves in a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point was to escape the demands of older age. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for effective management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about his voyage on the Endurance are being published quickly, and the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and draw lessons about leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""we have to lay off half the workforce."" While it may seem challenging to connect Shackleton's survival skills in extreme cold to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton's leadership qualities are relevant. He states, ""Even if a company handles its crises well, poor communication can still cause harm."" Shackleton is admired for his leadership and clear values, especially in life-threatening situations.

One of Shackleton's most remarkable decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice demonstrated his commitment to the safety of his men. In a crisis, people want a leader who takes charge. Unlike some modern managers who avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to face challenges head-on. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton reassured his crew, saying, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" Throughout their ordeal, Shackleton remained a strong leader.

MacGregor notes that Shackleton planned carefully, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible, ready to change plans when necessary. ""We've developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example,"" he says. ""Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.""

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor points out that in difficult times, especially in America, people often want quick solutions. For instance, if you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it's better to hold on rather than sell at a loss. Similarly, if a new product isn't successful, it's wise to stop selling it.

Shackleton led by example. During the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, without gloves. Shackleton insisted he wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn't. Another crew member recalled Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit during a previous expedition when they were starving, saying he would leave it in the snow because it was too valuable to waste.

As Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" notes, ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for today."""
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye, which has a feeding style similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by breaking into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to drill into the wood and its long tongue to pull out the insects. In contrast, the aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unusual feeding method was first noted over a century ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting abilities of two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, along with a female named Samantha and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes he had drilled. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes quickly went for the logs with food, chewing through the wood without needing to rely on visual signs. This raised the question of how they located the mealworms. Further tests showed that they did not depend on smell or sound either. Even when the smell of the insects was blocked, or when the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them.

Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes could sense the cavities in the wood. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and positions its large ears forward, focusing them in front of its nose. Dr. Erickson believes that the aye-aye is using a form of echo-location, listening for sounds that indicate a hollow space beneath the surface. It may also hear the movement of insects when they are disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that search for insects in wood, suggesting that the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously, similar to a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to extract the nut meat."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how well do we really know their lives and who they were when they were young? The few diaries we find often leave us wanting more, and family stories are often only partially remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but rarely do. While we might leave behind videos instead of photos, those images still only show a flat view of our lives.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardcover book of at least 20,000 words, complete with illustrations if desired. Her focus is not on famous individuals, but on everyday people. The idea came to her after conversations with her family, where she realized much of her own past was fading away. ""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now, after meeting people who have interesting stories to share,"" she explains. Many of her subjects say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they also find personal satisfaction in the process.

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share openly. One 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure in his life, said, ""I felt confident to be honest. I was surprised by what came out. Some memories were painful, like my divorce."" He wrote his story for his family, hoping they could learn from it, but he hasn’t yet shared it with his adult children. ""There are things that might hurt them, and I prefer they read it after I’m gone,"" he said.

Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their childhood experiences. ""It’s remarkable how much people are shaped by their parents,"" she says. The messages they received as children can affect their behavior throughout their lives. Some people marry those their parents would approve of, while others rebel against those expectations. Many still carry regrets or unresolved issues from their youth, even decades later. They often seek approval from parents who may never have been satisfied.

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Hannah maintains a respectful distance. ""I’m not there to pry,"" she says. People sometimes share more than they intended and later question whether it should be included. However, most want to be honest about their lives. ""This isn’t vanity publishing; it’s not about boasting. We are losing touch with our past, and these stories help us connect with our roots.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to craft the life story, organizing the events and adding her interpretation. Thanks to modern technology, she can produce everything except the binding, allowing clients to choose the cover color and title. The final product is tailored for a private audience and is well-crafted, reflecting the quality of the subject's life story. Each book costs nearly £3,000, with additional copies priced at £25 each. Although she receives about ten inquiries a week, the high cost limits many potential clients. ""I thought it would appeal to a broader audience,"" she admits, ""but most of my clients are well-off individuals, the kind who would have commissioned portraits in the past."""
CAE_24,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a large collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all replicas made from the originals, mostly created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery that has great natural light. There are many benefits to having plaster casts: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see nearly all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

Cambridge Darkroom is a photography center that has community darkrooms and a gallery featuring a variety of photography exhibitions. We offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows all members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (ages 12 to 16) through our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. Our center has a selection of photography books and magazines, as well as a full range of photographic materials.

The Sedgwick Museum has an impressive collection of fossils, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and regions of the world. It also contains Britain's oldest complete geological collection, created by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare specimens stored in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, greatly expanded the collection during his lifetime, establishing a remarkable museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to trace the major changes in life on Earth over time.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, making it one of the most unique tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, known as facsimiles, to preserve the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates, which served as memorials alongside tomb statues, spread from Germany throughout medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples can be found in Britain, with the widest variety available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, and while I can't say I'm proud of it, I have enjoyed 35 years with young children. This morning, I fed my baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very fortunate with my children. We share a love for opera, theatre, books, and music, which has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I see them more as a friend than a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. Although I have slapped my children in anger, I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them whenever they need me, as long as they reach out first. I believe that chasing them for contact only creates guilt, something my parents did to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young, around 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, and I regret that. However, now I can take them on trips to the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with my friends and attending parties and advertising events without feeling out of place. I think my job, which they find exciting, has helped our relationship.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and I had more children soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political career grew, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can join me. This way, they understand what I do when I’m not with them, and they don’t feel like I’m disappearing. I’ve noticed more politicians bringing their kids to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think deeply about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was present, but like many parents from the Seventies, I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently mentioned that we were too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure instead of being so relaxed. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that sense, your children never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. At 30, I had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, and it is, but it also makes you just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one smile from her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful; it can soften even the toughest person."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked ordinary. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964 and based on the Boeing 707. However, the 13 students from Europe and America were about to experience an extraordinary flight. Inside, the plane resembled a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous young scientists sat, feeling anxious. 

For a year, they had competed with other students to earn a spot on this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. The challenge was to propose creative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas were selected for this unique flight, which could be compared to an incredible roller-coaster ride. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring upwards before diving back down. The goal was to create a brief moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft would rise higher due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. During the few silent seconds between climbing and falling, everything inside the plane, including the students, would experience weightlessness, making them feel closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were thrown around the cabin. Then, the engines stopped, and we instantly transitioned to weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One step could send us soaring towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly, losing track of direction. Only gravity helps us understand where we are and where we can go.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, causing some students to land hard. After completing the first curve, some students felt queasy at the thought of the 29 more to come. Thirty curves allowed for ten minutes of ""space time"" for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to learn how cats always land on their feet. They released a device they built to investigate this, and one student managed to flip it over using a remote control. 

However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on the device, nearly damaging it. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen examined how the quality of metal joints is affected by the lack of gravity, which is important for building future space stations. Another group from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They believe that if they perfect this process, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's energy, similar to how a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not nausea. This exhilarating experience would stay with them for a long time. One student said, ""It was unforgettable. I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I experienced a strange time in my life when I had no summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine consecutive winters. I enjoyed this because I like winter. My parents had the idea of buying a small piece of land for my siblings and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you can plant trees on it, you can have it."" The goal was for us to always have a connection to New Zealand, which is a lovely thought since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees. I have always been passionate about land. I had spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and my family became enthusiastic as well. 

I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres. In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember that time as happy since I was often wet and cold. Each morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting while coming out of the Land Rover, still warm and dry, but facing the rain. My clothes were damp from the previous day, my boots were soaked, and my hands struggled with slippery laces. 

During that first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. I wore a planting bag around my neck, filling it with as many trees as I could. When the bag was full, it was heavy, but as it got lighter, planting became easier. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line to guide you. Once aligned, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back. 

I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, planting trees became almost automatic. You develop a rhythm and learn to use the least effort to dig the hole. This rhythm is common in many agricultural jobs; you train your body to perform a series of standard movements, making the task much easier. You create a regular process: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it was fascinating. My mind began to wander, allowing me to think about life and our connection to nature. Many of my thoughts about the natural world started during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very rewarding. I feel a sense of ownership in how they thrive. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand; such headlines make me anxious. Fortunately, the trees are now 20 years old and doing well. 

I should mention that I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand in 1984 for three months, alone. During that time, I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area remains very strong. It is the place where I feel most connected to the bond between people and the earth, which is a powerful relationship."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, known for caring for orphaned animals. However, the strange noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—caught my attention. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they become orphaned, they often starve and are never found. 

These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still suckling. Although the cubs were healthy, they were cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. I named the two females Primrose and Bluebell, and the male Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth first to mimic their mother’s licking, which helped them relieve themselves. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, albeit unsteadily. They seemed happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize its importance. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that he had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it’s crucial not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, given his small size. Feeling disheartened, I continued to care for the other cubs.

Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about my cubs, came to see me. He had found another male cub abandoned by its mother behind some silage bags. He knew she wouldn’t return, as the area had been disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother had left him; he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day.

By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more variety. At nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year, as the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.

By August, my badgers had started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase each other’s tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with colorful bruises.

During two late-night walks in a dry spell, I noticed other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, as badgers are very territorial and will fight off others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response led us to start a campaign to build a sett for them on the farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate aligned with their nightly walks. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for people to see inside.

As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became so excited about the tunnels that they forgot about their walks. The building costs were higher than expected, but a local bus company, aptly named Badgerline, sponsored part of the project, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a proper home.

One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to check on them and found three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Nowadays, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she has joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before rushing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - The Legacy of Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is working to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, during his time, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" using calculations from his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding this was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley, one of only two people in England paid to conduct scientific research at that time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew issues, but he later embarked on a second voyage that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From this journey, he published a chart in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This early work was essential for sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.

Dr. Clark aims to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 for this expedition, with support from Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while spending two years at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not only an astronomer but also researched geophysics. While serving as Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and pursued other interests.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his work, *Principia Mathematica*, which is foundational to classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, titled ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with more advanced instruments. These measurements are necessary because the Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data collected will help improve the current mathematical model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

Dr. Clark explains, ""It is common to measure the strength of the magnetic field but not its direction. To measure direction, you need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use global positioning satellites to determine true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments, and a Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground-based measurements will be beneficial for comparison.

Halley's journey across the Atlantic was significant as it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue the study of declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to succeed in his journey? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to dedicate eight months to this, so some might see me as obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a strong reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**Power Dressing**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire display their beautiful tail feathers to the often critical gaze of the peahens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could such extravagant features evolve in a competitive natural world? How do these birds manage to thrive despite their showy tails?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, a century after Darwin's death, to find answers. Darwin believed that species evolved through natural selection, where the fittest individuals survive and reproduce. However, he found the peacock's tail puzzling because it seemed to be a disadvantage rather than an advantage. To explain this, he introduced the idea of ""sexual selection,"" suggesting that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be some hidden quality that made those males more fit for survival. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it indicated something beneficial.

Today, researchers still seek to resolve this debate. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging, but the 200 birds at Whipsnade, which live in a semi-wild environment and are accustomed to humans, provide a unique opportunity for research. Petrie and her team are investigating two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most extravagant tails? And do these males possess any additional advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it merely a display, as Darwin believed?

Observations show that the peahens do seem to prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it remains unclear if these attractive males are also superior in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be less likely to carry parasites, and their bright plumage could signal their health. While there is evidence for this in other bird species, Petrie and her team have not yet been able to examine the internal health of the Whipsnade peacocks.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive ones to see if the attractive males' children grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is based on practical benefits.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician and biologist R.A. Fisher, known as ""Fisher's Runaway."" This theory suggests that if a female initially prefers a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that trait, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to increasingly long tails, reinforcing the idea that females might eventually select for beauty alone, aligning with Darwin's original thoughts."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should blend traditional and modern elements. He applied this idea to his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many impressive yachts filled with new technology. Most of these boats are descendants of a major design change that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. Perhaps I am, but I’m not sure.

My boat combines the charm of classic design with the benefits of modern technology. However, while technology is essential in today’s boat design and building, it often separates sailors from the true challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I’m not saying sailors should go back to facing every hardship. I believe it’s important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor.

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change creates a cabin that resembles an ocean liner, with a bed larger than one at home. To me, a boat should always feel like a boat, not a house on the water.

When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that it had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over the years, I learned how true that was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and most pleasant boat I ever sailed.

However, classic boats require a lot of maintenance, and when I injured my back, I realized I could no longer care for Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but found none that met my needs, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design programs, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before moving to the computer. After creating a model, just like boat builders did in the past, we refined the design together. The final version was perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, sails beautifully, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. This may be because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture. This traditional approach works well. In her calm presence, she proves that you don’t need to follow trends to find happiness, and sometimes it’s wise to learn from history. Built with timber treated to resist water, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat while still looking, feeling, and sailing like a true classic."

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to unwind. My room in the large 18th-century house was incredibly comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. Starting on the second day, I participated in various classes like body conditioning, yoga, and stretching. The instructors were very skilled, and I was amazed at how flexible I became throughout the week. They offer a wide range of treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, truly makes you feel rejuvenated. The staff in the treatment rooms were exceptionally friendly and professional. The atmosphere was vibrant and enthusiastic. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer a quieter activity and the weather is nice, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and energized, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to return. This is an ideal getaway for stressed working women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered the reception area. The Hall features a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, allowing you to avoid conversation if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, including an examination of weight and blood pressure. We were all referred to as patients, which felt a bit strange since I am healthy. However, I appreciated that a shoulder issue found during the exam was quickly addressed by the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I felt quite hungry and developed a headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you’re not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day, and additional treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not claim to be one. It is a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food, which features rich sauces and delightful desserts created by a French chef. Fortunately, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, allowing me to work off some of the tempting dishes. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) The spa includes a bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic, where I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed yet elegant. If you want to explore, the surrounding countryside is beautiful.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. The estate features stunning woodland walks and gardens across 376 acres. Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant, serves dishes that are simply delightful. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because of the many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other journalists' reports on fitness assessments and beauty treatments. Cliveden offers all these options if you want to use them before indulging at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It’s the best because it’s the most delicious I’ve ever had, but the worst because it contains 360 calories, which can be a setback if you’re trying to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the treatment, which led to the best night’s sleep I’ve had in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse group, including football teams, mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor, we have not developed significant differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This suggests that the traits that make us human are a recent development in our evolutionary history. Our ability to create art and other unique human characteristics likely come from just a small number of our genes. This is a heavy responsibility for such a limited set of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree rather than kind. For instance, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools; chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a basic form of language, using different sounds to warn of predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. This means that aside from art, there are few clear differences between humans and animals.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. We only have clear evidence of human art, such as cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments, starting around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we argue that our recent artistic achievements set us apart, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three common claims are made: human art is non-utilitarian, it is created for aesthetic pleasure, and it is learned rather than instinctive. 

First, as Oscar Wilde noted, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or reproduce, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art serves a purpose in communication, it is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong has clear functions, such as defending territory or attracting mates, which help transmit their genes. By this measure, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Different human cultures have distinct art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily distinguishable, but these styles are not genetically inherited. In contrast, some bird species are born with the ability to sing their specific songs, even if they have never heard them before. 

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly our styles change. For instance, geese have made the same sounds for 2,000 years, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum visitors can tell that a twentieth-century painting is more recent than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify the time and artist of a painting they do not know. However, even experts might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day for his own enjoyment and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These chimpanzee paintings challenge the distinctions between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the paintings by these apes were not created for practical purposes; they were made for the satisfaction of the artist. One might argue that human art is different because it is often intended as a form of communication, while the apes did not care to share their work with others. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human artworks were also created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth and also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are few big adventures left and even fewer heroes. In the past, children's stories featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and squinting eyes, journeying into the unknown. Nowadays, such characters are rare in fiction and even more so in real life. That was my belief until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's adventure involved leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, known locally as the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of this incredible journey from the comfort of his home. His team included four Britons (one was a medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the harshest deserts in the world, and Blackmore has written a captivating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 fulfilling years. He started the expedition for fun, to find purpose in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t return since no one had ever completed that route; we were going in without any knowledge.""

In the end, it took them 59 days to cross from west to east, and Blackmore described the desert as very kind to them. Anyone reading his remarkable story might question the use of the word ""kind."" The team faced unimaginable hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and the loss of part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn’t encounter the desert's famous sandstorms, and we avoided the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. However, we were constantly battling challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for both us and the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What motivated me most was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely alone. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very afraid of my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to start now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was toned, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the struggle it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to accomplish that. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert doesn’t compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — and the determination it brings. We were uplifted by our sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,"**Text: 'Rediscovering Manual Work'**

Susan Harr decides to unplug her devices and enjoy the benefits of doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing gadgets that simplify our lives and supposedly give us more free time. However, this belief is a form of brainwashing that makes us think technology is essential. Using our hands for tasks does not harm the environment, unlike many gadgets.

After a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost a lot to fix, Susan realized that gadgets often cause more problems than they solve. She began to let her household technology fade away as it broke down. This made her question what ""extra time"" technology really gives us. Does it just lead us to buy more gadgets for new activities? She suspects that marketing tricks us into thinking we need these devices.

When her broken gadget started making strange noises, even after being unplugged, she left it outside, where it now sits quietly. Susan enjoys working without noisy machines, allowing her to focus on her sewing. She feels safer sewing by hand, rather than using an electric machine that moves quickly towards her fingers. Plus, she can easily take her sewing supplies anywhere.

While there are some gadgets she appreciates, like her washing machine, she has found joy in living without others. After feeling too reliant on television, she returned her rented color TV and switched to a small black-and-white one. This change has encouraged her family to spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. For Susan, sewing has become a new passion, and her old sewing machine now serves as a plant table. 

People often think they cannot live without technology, but Susan believes that life was once filled with hard work and struggle. Computers now do many tasks for us, but she finds that sewing by hand is enjoyable and fulfilling. She can listen to the radio or talk with loved ones while sewing, and even watch her favorite shows without feeling guilty, as she is being productive.

Initially, Susan was intimidated by the idea of hand-sewing, thinking it would be tedious. However, she has discovered that it is calming and satisfying to see her work improve. She finds that tasks get done quickly, and she can enjoy a slower pace of life. She also appreciates the simple pleasure of washing dishes by hand, allowing her to daydream.

Now, Susan looks around her home and questions the need for many gadgets. She wonders if they really need a freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. In fact, she realizes they could save a lot of money by living without electric lights!"
CAE_62,"**Text: The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst**

Charles Hurst is a skilled cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It’s hard to tell if he is truly in a hurry or just acting tough. However, looking around his workshop, it’s clear he is busy, with many unfinished pieces of furniture and colorful wooden planks everywhere.

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a strong reputation. His order book is always full for months ahead, even though he doesn’t actively promote himself. People know that if they want a quality cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen unit, Hurst is the right choice. While it’s not hard to find a furniture-maker, finding one who focuses on making well-crafted furniture with simple designs is more challenging. Hurst notes, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers.""

As a craftsman with high standards, Hurst often feels disappointed by modern furniture. He expresses his frustration with poorly made, mass-produced items and craftsmen who create low-quality pieces. His pursuit of perfection is a key part of his success, along with his talent. Hurst is confident in his skills, stating, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" Despite his confidence, he shows some humility towards the end of our conversation.

Hurst is self-taught. When asked how he learned his craft, he replies, ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up."" Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return for more projects. He enjoys completing entire houses for clients, but admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients are unsure of what they want until it’s too late, but he appreciates clients who have clear expectations.

While Hurst is proud of his work, he also acknowledges the skills of others. He says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He criticizes craftsmen who take too long to create a single piece, and he is not fond of degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. He believes furniture should be practical and usable, not just a statement piece.

Hurst may be confident and direct, but he is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" showing a grounded attitude towards his craft."
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping, which suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory suggests that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It argues that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and restore our energy.

The second theory focuses on the benefits of sleep for learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day, and without sleep, we would struggle to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It suggests that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own quirks and peculiarities. These might include a love for entering newspaper contests, a habit of collecting beer mats, or a tendency to write letters to the editor about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality.

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces. One force is called individualism, which encourages us to be unique, while the other is conformity, which pushes us to fit in. For many, the desire to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out and be different. 

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to discuss their shared interests or challenges. The key idea here is 'common.' They seek others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, can be comforting.

Most of us feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While we may follow the crowd, we often resist the idea that we are doing so. We feel a need to express our individuality, like when a man at a bar declares, ""I say what I think,"" or when a newcomer insists, ""You must take me as you find me. I don’t follow social rules.""

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many people succeed in their careers by doing just that. For instance, Bob Dylan, the American singer, has said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it passionately, you will surprise many people."" However, this assertion of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are.

A true eccentric is not focused on what others think. They act according to their true selves. This sets eccentrics apart from enthusiasts, pranksters, clever criminals, attention-seekers, and recluses. These individuals are aware of society and often act in response to it. Some want to impress others, while others want to escape from society. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives freely, without concern for societal expectations."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four prominent naturalists to share the wildlife book that has had the most impact on them.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the privilege of meeting many influential figures in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been central to environmental discussions in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, I found her insights made everything clearer. Choosing her book was more challenging. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*, but I believe *The Home of Man* is her most significant work. It discusses the rapid growth of cities while addressing the larger themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now refer to as ""sustainable human development."" I have not found another book that matches its depth.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book beautifully explains the intriguing world of animal communication through words and images. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos into a well-organized social structure. You can identify partners and family groups. Niko Tinbergen was a remarkable behaviorist who aimed to make his research accessible to everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion resulted in a book that appeals to anyone who loves nature. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, vividly show their behaviors, such as aggression and submission. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
Without a doubt, *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell has greatly influenced my life. It not only led me to a wonderful husband and a fulfilling career in conservation but also solidified my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read this book. After two years of challenges, opening *My Family and Other Animals* at the end of a long day brightened my spirits. It beautifully intertwines animals, people, joy, and beauty, creating a vision of a world worth protecting. While many criticize humanity for its negative impact on nature, I remember Gerald as a child in the book, viewing all living beings as a family, connected and inseparable. This is a vital perspective for us all.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I discovered *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images captivated me. I already owned other bird books and had spent vacations learning to identify birds, which inspired me to start sketching them. However, *The Shell Bird Book* offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a section on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and stunning images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific understanding. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new possibilities for my future."
CAE_37,"**Do Reviews Sell Books?**

We asked five prominent British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here’s what they shared.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are crucial for publishers; they are the first thing we check in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers often take bad reviews in stride, believing that any mention can help sales. They enjoy reviews that reflect their own opinions about a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
While publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, their needs are different. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews today are more varied and accessible than they were 40 years ago, but there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which most people read. Weekly summaries of books are often insufficient, and even original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. However, publishers need reviews to promote books and authors effectively. A lively review from a respected source can boost sales, especially if there are multiple reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, and we rarely advertise, so we rely on literary editors to review our books. Positive reviews are far more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Good reviews can significantly increase book sales, but they need to be combined with other factors like recommendations from readers, support from booksellers, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, booksellers often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes years of great reviews for a good writer to gain readers. Interestingly, some poorly received books or those without reviews can still sell very well. The impact of reviews is unpredictable, although non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for positive reviews, but do they actually lead to sales? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn’t sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer’s name matter? Thirty years ago, certain reviewers had a strong influence on public opinion. Nowadays, unexpected reviewers or particularly clever reviews can also motivate potential buyers to visit the bookstore."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith, one of the few artisans in the country who creates hand-cut weathervanes. Graham designs each piece to meet the specific needs of his customers. He explains, ""This way, I can create a unique, personalized item."" Many of his customers are women looking for special gifts for their husbands, wanting something that reflects their interests in work or leisure.

Graham's work is quite different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made featured a witch on a broomstick, which surprised his wife and impressed their friends. They began asking him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that the subjects I could use were endless,"" he says. This realization led him to focus on his weathervane business.

Before starting this venture, Graham trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Five years ago, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles: she became the main breadwinner while he took care of their children and developed his business. He has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job lacked creativity, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he shares. Graham has now created over 100 original designs, paying close attention to detail. He always seeks customer approval for the design before he begins the hand-cutting process.

Graham also keeps a variety of traditional designs available, as they remain popular alongside his unique creations. ""People are drawn to handmade items,"" he notes. ""They appreciate the chance to own something different."" He has no plans to expand his business, as he prefers to maintain it as a rural craft. ""I have found my niche in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I find great satisfaction in transforming a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he explains.

For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand changes in the weather by indicating shifts in wind direction. Nowadays, as more people move to rural areas, they want to add unique touches to their homes, which has benefited crafts like Graham's. He has become busier, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift that stands out."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

The beginning of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who worked as a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. Things started badly when a film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He felt disappointed and worried because he hadn’t made any money in two years, and this film was his only hope to calm his angry bank manager.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to his previous role as a television executive or started a television project he had paused. Instead, he made a choice that many, including himself, thought was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. It was inspired by a farrier he met while visiting a friend in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive for no reason. Its owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were known as ""horse whisperers."" This story fascinated Evans, and he began to research it, initially planning to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after losing interest in the film industry, he decided to write the story as a book.

Throughout the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing others, but I felt very alone and thought my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was deeply in debt, worried about how to support my children, and questioning if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from his bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for more details, he suggested that Evans might receive a $30,000 advance for the book. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had at least two months of work left. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with the summary, to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""What?"" Evans replied. The agent explained, ""It's okay; I feel something big is happening.""

What happened next became a significant moment in publishing history. Within a week of intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were in shock. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans said. They also didn’t send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for the film rights. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent in the US, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" 

As they agreed on this amount, the studios each presented their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four prominent filmmakers called one after another, eager to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me over coffee on his wooden porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been like a fairy tale so far. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don’t want to become just an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then hear, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll bring in someone else now.'""

He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was uncertain if he wanted to pursue it. ""I think it would be unwise not to write another novel,"" he concluded."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer faces challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Today, chess is increasingly a game for younger players. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and competing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game impressively, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. At 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

Chess has changed significantly in the last two decades. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s mental strength and endurance are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high, with a chess clock ensuring players make their moves in a set time. If they fail to do so, they lose immediately. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also evolved. Much preparation now happens off the board, not just in psychological battles. Players must prepare thoroughly before matches, especially since computers can store millions of chess games and provide quick access to information about opponents. In recent matches, players have used large teams to analyze each other’s strategies continuously. 

The opening moves of a chess game are now studied in great detail, and being well-prepared can be crucial. Today’s chess scene has more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes worldwide. Success requires both mental and physical effort, as a single game can last up to eight hours. For chess masters, this time is a constant challenge, and losing focus can lead to failure. The presence of the chess clock adds to the stress, often leading to frantic moments where players must make quick moves or risk losing. 

In these intense situations, players must rely on their nerves, determination, and strong will to win. At the highest level, the pain of losing is hard to bear, while winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one victory is not enough to win a tournament; players must be ready for the next challenge. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing about 10 kg.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game puzzling. However, it also adds to his legacy. If he has returned for financial reasons, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer genuinely believes he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some of the new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's a low-budget project, but we aren't sure how low,"" he says. ""It definitely won't cost over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Remarkably, Nick had never seen or read a play before writing *Peaches*. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would actually be performed,"" he shares. ""The play is set in a car, which I probably wouldn’t do now because I understand the challenges involved. Back then, I knew nothing."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my work to be performed, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made significant progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just completed a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard, even during his time at Bristol, where he practiced his craft in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, gained public attention as the lead in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he smiles. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that such recognition was likely. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from leading roles in school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid doing homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the accolades to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They expect a hit, but I just want two people to buy it to be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things work out,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel discouraged. Just when I was about to give up, I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt really down, and I had been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has received more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry community, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I realized I needed to after getting bored stuffing envelopes at a theater."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader since that’s all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a bold step. ""My poetry has a structure, which limits the chance of making mistakes. A novel can be any length, so there are more opportunities for errors. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I produce work without caring about its quality."""
CAE_1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, believes she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she wants to avoid the wrong crowd. At 31, she is an art student who loves historical romances and is searching for the right partner, worried that her knobbly knees might hinder her chances. Despite her concerns, she remains hopeful, which ultimately helps her and others in the story. The author writes with lively energy, using a style reminiscent of early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It offers a humorous perspective on radio, seen through the eyes of a clever but timid child named Francis With. Francis works at WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, and soap-opera stars. Set in a small American town, the author skillfully uses dry humor and simple language to transport readers back to the more relaxed days of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores and old Ford cars.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poetess, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poetess writes poor poetry, which bothers Richard, and she seeks his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author unravels these issues is even more captivating. He moves the story forward with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a delightful and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become intertwined in each other's lives for 25 years. At the beginning of this lengthy novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that they both loved a woman who was killed years earlier. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to deeply connect with the characters.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who, feeling guilty about a past mistake, takes on the role of 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is gradually becoming an eccentric bachelor amid the chaos of family life. The story explores deep emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a significant direct contribution to development. While they may help build homes or schools, they often pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the volunteer could provide. This is particularly true for gap year volunteers, who usually lack the necessary skills or experience. Therefore, many studies question whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a genuine desire to help or if young people are more interested in gaining experience that will benefit their careers. However, these projects can help develop individuals who may act ethically in support of those in need throughout their lives.

B. Volunteering can promote greater international understanding, improve conflict resolution skills, encourage participation in global issues through civic organizations, and create international social networks among everyday people. In this way, the overall benefits can exceed the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and host communities, and contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those who lack access to such opportunities. Volunteers may continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities to advance their own goals.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can resemble imperialism or self-serving charity, where wealthy Westerners seek personal growth. At its best, it can provide valuable technical assistance for development. It can benefit both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing power imbalances, poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of personal strategies to help others. These limited strategies, focused on making a small difference, can seem positive in a climate that is skeptical of large governments and businesses. However, they also avoid the need for democratic governance and reduce development to individual acts of charity, often failing to address the root causes of poverty in rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is often misplaced, the act of volunteer tourism can sometimes be seen as simple charity. However, when it is promoted as sustainable development and when gap-year companies market their programs as such, it reflects a decline in the understanding of development issues. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from the social realities of global inequalities and the poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them get out of bed. This is why clock radios are popular. But how do you choose a good one? A panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

One model has a 'dual alarm function,' which I initially thought would let you wake up to a buzzer, snooze for a bit, and then get up. However, the instruction booklet suggests using this feature to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and another for weekends. But who really schedules their life like that? This model costs about the same as another we tested, but it includes a cassette player, allowing you to fall asleep to your favorite tapes and wake up without news. We all agreed the radio quality was excellent, but the size was an issue—it’s as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best in terms of design and overall performance. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I found the digital display appealing, with its stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze button is easy to tap even with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which led to confusion when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don’t have to reset it if someone accidentally unplugs it. Everyone liked this feature, but we found it challenging to set up. Still, mastering it made us feel sophisticated.

Tom Granger criticized another model with a built-in lamp, calling it 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was difficult to position and not useful for reading, as it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed that tuning the radio was difficult. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, its bright colors appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out, unlike the others. It was also the only model we could set up without reading the instructions, thanks to its traditional controls. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin, meaning it might go off 10 minutes earlier or later than set. Paul Bridges laughed at this, calling the model 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it was standard and took up little space, plus it had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said it was easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you can never be sure if you pressed the buttons correctly, which makes it hard to trust that it will work. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for its sharp spines that cover its body. They are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward for protection. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, making them more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using that ability only as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in burrows. While all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; some may remain awake throughout the year if conditions are suitable."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their dreams.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""Flying through the air and landing smoothly feels amazing, but it can also be frightening. Sometimes, I don’t feel well or the weather is bad, making it hard to see, but I push through. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and friendships, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete on the same courses and receive equal treatment—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours daily on the bike, along with stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment required.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because few schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, making it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to a lack of stability in the women's team. Despite these challenges, I enjoy rowing and staying fit, and I appreciate the social aspect of the sport.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how vast it is! I found Britain too confining and safe. I was very determined and disliked being controlled by others. Each walk has been unique. My walk across Australia was the most painful experience, covering 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! I had to succeed because my sponsorship would end after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, making them hesitant to sponsor us.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, which is evident on the roads. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman in racing has its challenges. Men tend to see me as competition, which has led to many tough moments. You need to be competitive and assertive. Earning money in this sport is difficult, and what I do earn goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s encouraging to see more women joining the sport each year. I love saloon car racing because I strive for perfection with every lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 AM three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Sometimes, I even fall asleep at my desk! There’s a lot of pressure before races, and I really push myself during competitions. I often wonder why I do this, and I realize it’s because a) I feel happier when I’m fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also less for women. However, we have established an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he recognized Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person, usually working alone in the hills. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have approached him if my friend hadn’t encouraged me. Nervously, I introduced myself and asked for his signature, which he kindly gave me. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below it. His art often reflected real things, so the lines he drew might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was even worse, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak freely. Still, I managed to tell Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and proudly showed my friend the signature. He noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and urged me to go back and take advantage of the opportunity. He suggested I ask if I could draw Picasso’s portrait.

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided not to ask if I could draw him, fearing he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, set up my pad, took out a crayon, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled mischievously and made it hard for me to draw by acting out funny expressions. He rolled his eyes, stuck out his tongue, and made silly shapes with his hands. Although it was tempting to give up, his playful spirit felt like a challenge. I sensed he wanted to see how determined I was.

Eventually, Picasso settled down and allowed me to study him closely. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his 84 years, with bright, dark eyes that were full of life. I was captivated by his eyes and tried to capture their intensity in my drawing. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed distant and absorbed in his own thoughts. 

When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my portrait, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. However, Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly handed him my crayon, and he made a few swift strokes on the paper. In seconds, he created a lively outline of a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single, joyful line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Looking back, I feel incredibly lucky. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a great deal to me."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This article explains the strategies that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Freshness Factor**  
Supermarkets understand that customers value fresh produce. To create this impression, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance or display house plants. They might also have an in-store bakery that fills the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors used in the store, like green, are chosen to suggest freshness. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, does not match this fresh image.

**B. Strategic Product Placement**  
The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use computerized systems to identify which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit items in these spots, while also using eye-level shelves to catch attention. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters, and complementary items, like desserts near ice cream, encourage additional purchases.

**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to walk past more tempting, higher-priced items. Chain stores may also position popular products away from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them, thus encountering other tempting products along the way.

**D. Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from a crowded display style to a more boutique-like approach, showcasing limited fashion items. This creates an impression of exclusivity, even though their clothing is mass-produced. Their success is due to both effective store design and appealing clothing.

**E. The Impact of Total Costs**  
Food shoppers often focus more on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items to attract customers. They may even sell some staples at a loss to draw shoppers in, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They achieve low prices by buying in bulk and negotiating discounts with manufacturers.

**F. The Importance of Pricing**  
Shoppers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and pay more attention to individual prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can influence buying decisions. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Effective Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, helping customers see the true colors of clothing. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to highlight fresh produce.

**H. Guided Pathways**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers through the store. These paths, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" encourage customers to explore. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use more inviting carpets in sales areas to encourage shoppers to venture off the main paths.

**I. In-Store Promotions**  
As you enter a supermarket, you are often greeted by large, colorful images of delicious food, which can be hard to resist if you’re hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that display advertisements as you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and reportedly increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, aged 58, is famous for reaching the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written several books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail solo around the world in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sailing trip, where I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first experience on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. He moved carefully and quietly.

Eventually, we reached a steep drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before, and he said he hadn’t, so I showed him how. After I finished, he politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit uneasy, but he managed to lower himself safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion that we combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural progression from our Skye adventure.

I was impressed by Robin's leadership. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin consulted everyone first. Although most crew members hesitated to give advice, it felt good to be part of the decision-making. Honestly, I found sailing challenging and somewhat dull. The moments of crisis were easier to handle because they brought excitement. However, I struggled with the long days at sea. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin was a natural sailor who enjoyed fixing the engine and the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless.

The crew was cramped, with six people on a 32-foot yacht meant for four. On a mountain expedition, you can get some space from each other. When we arrived in Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times while climbing when if Robin fell, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be very careful. I also underestimated how difficult the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more remarkable. The first time we tried to reach the top, we were active for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we nearly fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges but completely trusted me and followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted my decision. I knew he was worried about the boat and whether it would make it through the ice, but he still wanted to try climbing the mountain again.

The only time our relationship nearly faced a crisis was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns keeping watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt he didn’t trust me, which made me insecure, and I expressed my feelings. Robin quickly reassured me that I had misunderstood the situation. While we enjoyed our trip to Skye, we truly got to know each other by the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for thousands of years, existing in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they discarded apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and different from the apples we know today, which were called 'windings' in Ancient Britain.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. One dessert apple, called Decio, was likely introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in Britain, and Norman varieties soon became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple types, leading to the apples we have today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
By the thirteenth century, several apple varieties were established in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, giving rise to the term 'costermonger,' which means a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This changed in the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many apple grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them precious. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the well-known apple planter was John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed.' Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans viewed him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees and unique clothing inspired many folktales.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa discovered a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named this apple 'Hawkey.' After presenting it at a fruit show, a judge exclaimed it was 'Delicious!' In 1895, this apple was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples globally.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith, the daughter of convicts. She was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith,' she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she discovered a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she remarked that it was typical of God to create something valuable from what we consider waste, reflecting both the apple and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from northern India to Africa. However, most commercial apples come from just a few varieties, often chosen for their appearance or durability rather than taste. This trend of uniformity is dulling our taste and reducing genetic diversity. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are beginning to seek more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to preserve diversity in apples or other foods. We must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

**Small Groups**

We travel in small, informal groups, usually averaging 16 people, led by experienced guides. This allows you to truly discover the places we visit and connect with local cultures. It’s a rewarding experience for all travelers.

**Variety of Travel Methods**

We use many types of transport during our trips, often on the same journey. You might travel by coach, local bus, train, minibus, boat, canoe, raft, camel, light plane, or even on foot. Each trip reflects the character of the local environment.

**Who Travels with Explore?**

Our travelers are interesting individuals who are ready to embrace new experiences. Most come from the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the USA. Our trips are designed for anyone in good health who is reasonably fit and adaptable. Most participants are aged between 25 and 55, with many couples and solo travelers.

**Activities and Interests**

Each trip with Explore Worldwide is unique, so we categorize our adventures into eight different themes, highlighting key activities and interests. Each category showcases special features of a tour, but many other factors contribute to the overall success of our trips, such as unique locations, cultural encounters, and personal involvement.

**Cultural and Adventure Trips**

Most of our trips have a strong cultural focus, with some tours emphasizing local cultures, ethnic groups, and historical sites. Destinations of cultural interest include Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Belize. Many trips include short walks to visit lesser-known sites.

**Wildlife and Nature**

Our wildlife safaris take you to some of the best game parks in the world, allowing thrilling encounters with animals in their natural habitats. In Africa, you might have the chance to explore the wild on foot, tracking animals like the rare silver-back mountain gorilla or going on bush walks with local guides. Most safaris involve camping, but some offer hotel accommodations.

**Cultural Encounters**

A highlight of our adventures is meeting ethnic and tribal peoples, such as the Tuareg of the Sahara, the Maya of Mexico, or the Huli of Papua New Guinea. Many of these groups have traditional lifestyles that are under threat. We travel in small groups to promote understanding and respect for different cultures while minimizing our impact on their environments.

**Easy to Moderate Hiking**

Many trips include easy walking through beautiful countryside, often staying in rented accommodations or hotels. Some involve village-to-village hiking, where you may stay overnight in local homes or simple huts. Destinations for these hikes include Spain, Italy, Greece, Morocco, and many others. On longer hikes, your main luggage is transported separately, so you only carry a small daypack.

**Major Treks**

We offer a few challenging treks for experienced hikers, sometimes at high altitudes. These trips may involve staying with local people or camping in stunning mountain ranges like the Himalayas or the Andes. Support vehicles and porters are usually provided, so you won’t need to carry heavy gear.

**Wilderness Experiences**

Exploring remote wilderness areas is an exciting adventure. These places, like the Amazon Rainforest or the Sahara Desert, offer unique experiences for adventurous travelers.

**Sail and River Journeys**

Our sail and river journeys are some of the most relaxing holidays we offer. We use local boats to explore places like Upper Egypt and the Galapagos Islands. River trips can vary from short paddling excursions to thrilling whitewater rafting experiences. No prior experience is needed, and safety skills are taught quickly. Our river journeys provide a unique view of the beautiful landscapes and wildlife."
CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top long-distance runner from Britain, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a beautiful mountain path leads from a quiet road in Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. This stunning but remote place, called Nanyuk, has been my training base during the winter for the past three years. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners until my recent trip. 

On this fourth winter training trip, I decided to change my routine. I participated in my first race in Kenya, where the air is thin, and I stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I received an invitation from the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss. 

Training at high altitudes increases the number of red blood cells in the body, which helps carry more oxygen. This has contributed to the success of many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa, which took place in Nairobi, was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. It was a humbling experience for me, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, and only three were not Kenyan. Despite this, I felt I had performed well.

However, I believe that Kenyan runners' success is not solely due to the altitude. They have a straightforward and enjoyable approach to running. Their running style appears effortless, their diet is simple, and they seem to genuinely enjoy competing. One important aspect of their success is their training methods, which I learned about during my time at the training camp.

The national team camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and lush vegetation. The facilities are basic, with athletes living in shared dormitories with college students. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training in the late morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. Each day starts at six in the morning, with a briefing from the coaches. We were reminded to take it easy during the morning run because a tough workout awaited us later. 

On average, we covered about 40 kilometers each day, which is just under a marathon distance. Sundays were easier, with only one scheduled run of 20 kilometers. Life at the camp was simple. Pre-breakfast routines involved just splashing water on our faces and brushing our teeth. Breakfast consisted of tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After our runs, we would drive to a stream fed by the melting glaciers of Mount Kenya for a proper wash.

By the end of my stay, I gained a deeper understanding of why Kenyan runners are so successful. Their achievements cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simplicity of their mountain lifestyle, their intense training, and their passion for running might be the true reasons behind Kenya's dominance in long-distance running."
CAE_7,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

As many people know, advertising is struggling. This issue is not just due to the recession; advertising began to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are deeper and are happening globally. The sad reality is that advertising has not adapted to the fast changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as brands and media options have increased, target audiences have become more diverse. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not. This is a major reason why advertising is not effective.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only purchase a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen each year, and for cars, you typically buy one every three years. You may not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even when you consider all the different products and services, it is likely that you do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In contrast, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we focus on the 9,500 brands that are actively promoted, the average person only buys about 400 of them, which is roughly 4 percent. This challenges the common belief that half of advertising is wasted; in reality, it could be that 96 percent of advertising is wasted, but no one knows which part is effective. 

When you watch TV, try to count how many commercials are for brands you actually buy or might buy in the future. Most people find that only about 6 percent of the ads are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent of the commercials are likely wasted. Many people believe they are not influenced by advertising, but the truth is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. 

Waste is a natural part of advertising through media. The idea that every person who sees an ad will rush to buy the product is unrealistic. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many ads have shown that they can work. Advertisers need to reach a large audience to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as they cannot predict who will be interested in their products.

Even with careful targeting, advertisers cannot eliminate waste completely. For example, even the best direct mail campaigns do not get a 100 percent response rate. This is a key difference between advertising through media and personal selling. A salesperson might successfully sell to every potential customer they meet, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would communicate with them directly instead of using mass media.

Any advertiser who can attract one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is considered successful. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled to gain a million new customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can reach more than 2 percent of the population is seen as very successful, and this represents a small portion of the overall audience. While mass media can be an effective way to reach these customers, for advertising to improve, it must focus on more specific target audiences than ever before."
CAE_43,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Explores Britain's Most Eco-Friendly Home**

Charles Clover visits a unique home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, known for its environmental friendliness. This area is home to Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral famous for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is considered the greenest home in Britain.

The Vales have created a house that uses rainwater for drinking and washing, recycles sewage into compost, and heats the home using waste heat from appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house, which looks traditional with its clay tile roof, is located 300 yards from the Minster and blends in with the local architecture. It was approved by planners even though it is in a conservation area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice complete silence. The house is extremely well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Inside, it feels peaceful, especially on a sunny summer day when the windows are closed and the conservatory warms the air. Robert shows how the house has clever ventilation systems to create airflow, as it is designed to be airtight. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to environmental issues since the 1970s when they wrote a book called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to eliminate the need for mains water. They installed composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and special gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. They also let water from washing flow into the garden, as they do not use a dishwasher due to their beliefs about strong detergents.

Robert explains that they want to show that it is possible to design a house that is much less harmful to the environment without sacrificing comfort. The only medieval feature of the house is its design, with a hall that reaches the full height of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their electricity usage was only nine units a day, costing about 70p, which is much less than typical four-bedroom homes.

Soon, they will install solar panels worth £20,000 in the garden, which will allow the house to generate more electricity than it uses. They will still draw some electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances, but they expect to have enough surplus to charge an electric car in the future. The only source of heating is a small wood-burning stove, which they rarely use except during the coldest days.

When Clover visited in February, Robert mentioned it was too warm to light the fire, with the first-floor temperature at 18°C, which is comfortable despite being lower than usual. He explains that comfort depends on factors like insulation and the absence of drafts. He compares this to an Edwardian woman who felt comfortable at 12.5°C due to her clothing. He suggests that people living in older homes should adapt to similar conditions, though this idea may not be popular.

The house's success lies in its simplicity and low-tech design, using materials from local builders and craftsmen, making it affordable to build. This approach has faced resistance from commercial building companies, who are not keen on this model."
CAE_51,"**The Camera Never Lies**

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a rational person and even a scientist. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article, accepting fairies as supernatural beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out images of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges a fundamental idea about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In reality, it can, and it always has. Nowadays, we often use computer software to edit our digital images, and it is a misconception that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths, who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths held a respected position, similar to doctors and astrologers, as they were the only ones who made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture were crafted by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used the beautiful wrought iron features. In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more open approach to interior design. Still, much of the new work seems repetitive, with manufacturers labeling their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks and similar items.

Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and several events in the coming weeks aim to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be entering a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are becoming more aware of the craft. Modern power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to shape metal without the hard labor of the past. Dawson explains that these artists now have the tools to express their creativity.

The exhibition features about 250 pieces, including bookends and a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90 and going up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual artists, but a portion will be kept by the Association to promote quality ironwork. Dawson's own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a hand-blown glass shade. He describes his style as allowing steel to bend and take shape when heated, comparing it to drawing with metal in space.

Many artists are drawn to iron because it is a challenging material. Unlike other metals that are easier to shape when cold, iron and steel require more skill. Susan May, a trained jeweler, finds it magical that iron is soft when hot but becomes hard and unyielding when it cools. Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs resembles a ball and chain, while another looks like a Celtic cross. She appreciates the cold, hard nature of steel and its permanence.

No other metal has provided as much visual enjoyment or a sense of security as iron. It is likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for many years to come, as long as we can avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**

I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying, and I still find it strange. 

The session I attended to stop smoking was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I hadn’t planned to quit, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. Plus, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lifestyles.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session in Birmingham called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I clearly stated, ""I won’t be trying to stop; I’m here to write, not to quit, so it wouldn’t be fair to expect your method to work on me."" I felt very reasonable because I genuinely enjoyed smoking; it brought me real pleasure.

The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of quitting began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, unrelated to anyone else. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, similar to hunger, faded after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it turned out to be fine. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was just relaxing at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I’ve come to realize that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to adjust to—eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre intermission. These are all moments when I would have previously smoked."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been testing my friends to see if they recognize her. When I tell them I am writing her biography, if they respond with excitement, they pass the test. 

Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She deserves recognition simply because she is the only British woman to win a Nobel Prize in science. If someone had the same achievement in literature, they would be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person, much like the complex crystals she studied. Her life reflects significant changes in the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend and worked in the same field. I went to a local bookstore, but I found that there were no biographies of Pauling available. I was surprised that Pauling, a highly influential chemist and Nobel Prize winner, was not considered interesting enough for British readers. 

Even scientists sometimes think that biographies of scientists are not engaging. Peter Medawar, a Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers do too. This attitude reflects a common belief that there is a big gap between the arts and sciences, which still exists in literature. Only a few famous scientists make it into biography sections of bookstores. 

It is not true that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. For example, a well-known geneticist said he would be happy to discuss his work but did not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This reluctance to share personal stories can create a false image of science and may discourage young people from pursuing scientific careers.

Fortunately, this is changing. Nowadays, scientists often appear in public in ways other than just scientific interviews. For instance, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help make scientists more relatable to the public.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be dry and overly respectful, often ignoring the personal lives of scientists. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been portrayed with their flaws on display. Readers find it interesting to see how creative geniuses deal with personal challenges, even if those challenges seem unrelated to their scientific work.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her research. She made significant discoveries, including the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She achieved these successes by pushing scientific techniques to new limits. However, she also balanced her career with her family life, raising three children and being married to a husband who was often away for work. While her personal life may not directly relate to her scientific achievements, it shows her ability to integrate different aspects of her life.

There is much in Hodgkin's life that is universally interesting, but it is important to recognize her scientific contributions as well. Scientific inquiry was her passion, as it must be for any successful scientist. The challenge for biographers is to convey this passion effectively. Many readers may not have the scientific background to understand complex ideas without extensive explanation. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that educated people who would feel embarrassed for not knowing a famous literary figure often remain unaware of the rich legacy of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for her unique ability to find water. She uses a forked hazel stick to detect underground water sources. Farmers whose wells have dried up often seek her help. Along with her husband, she runs a well-drilling business that uses modern equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, when it comes to finding water, she relies solely on her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This skill, known as dowsing, involves locating water, minerals, and lost items underground. There are various theories about how dowsing works, ranging from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One of the more believable theories suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, with water vibrating more than other substances. It is thought that dowsers can sense these vibrations while standing on the ground. Some dowsers claim they can ""feel"" water, while others say they can ""smell"" it, as smell is a very sensitive sense.

In recent years of drought, Margaret has been very busy, sometimes having a waiting list of nearly six weeks. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells, as wells typically last a long time, meaning she only sees each customer once. Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns, which are now used as holiday homes, where installing long water pipes is too costly. There are also golf course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret usually looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She emphasizes that wells cannot be drilled where there is a risk of contamination from waste. The water she finds is usually in cracks in solid rock, and if it is brought up correctly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, where they work, there are many minerals, so they must be cautious about iron in the water. Additionally, electricity is needed to run the pump, which can be expensive if the well is far from power sources.

To begin her search for water, Margaret first studies a map of the area and uses a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map; it swings when she is above a water source. After identifying potential areas on the map, she walks over the land with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation and sways slightly. Once this feeling passes, she uses the stick to find the exact drilling spot.

Holding the two forks of the stick, she pulls them slightly apart to create tension. If water is directly below, the straight part of the stick will rise. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates; even a small mistake can mean missing the water entirely. Margaret and her husband often dowse the same area, and they usually agree on where to drill. If they disagree, they will continue searching until they reach a consensus.

Margaret's skills are not just a local tradition; they have intrigued anthropologists and writers for a long time. She describes her ability as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. Without this ""sixth sense,"" it would be difficult for her family to sustain their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be exciting to try something completely different. We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, 23, is a young mother with two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, 30, who works as a waitress in a fancy London restaurant. 

Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and crowded, which was very different from her hometown. She felt nervous and overwhelmed. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when she tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and reassured her that everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line of customers was waiting outside, and Amanda felt anxious about remembering their orders. Luckily, the ordering system was automated, so that was one less worry. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she struggled to hear customers over the loud music. She often had to ask them to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and just wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, which surprised Amanda. She realized waitressing was much harder than she thought. She used to think it was an easy job, but it actually requires a friendly personality and the ability to handle a busy environment. Amanda felt too shy to work on a Saturday night when it would be even busier. She was also disappointed with the tips she received, especially from wealthy customers. In the end, she was happy to return to her children, as being a mother felt much easier after her day as a waitress.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy, who is 30, was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She had heard that Amanda's daughters could be mischievous, but she thought she could manage. 

After Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have three hours of peace. But she was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded her that she still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry. 

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, quickly shopped at the supermarket, and took her home for lunch. However, when she brought Sophie home from school, things got chaotic. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and played a loud game. Cindy tried to stay calm, thinking they would tire out soon, but they had more energy than she expected! After much effort, she finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the real challenge began. The girls kept asking for glasses of water, which was just a trick to get them downstairs to watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. She realized that taking care of two small children was much more tiring than she had imagined. There was no time to think about herself, and the responsibility felt overwhelming. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, 30, a primary school teacher. 

On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt luxurious! She was unsure how to dress for school and hoped she wouldn’t stand out. At assembly, she faced about 400 students and hoped to blend in. 

In math class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from her own school experience. She helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There was so much to do before classes resumed. She attended a staff meeting and ended up helping with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which she enjoyed, followed by a French lesson where the children practiced on her, revealing her rusty French skills. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, she was exhausted, while the children seemed full of energy. Speaking in front of the class was the hardest part for her. Although teachers have more holidays, she decided she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! Rosemary's farm is large, with 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream for sale.

Hilary spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, bottling milk and making ice cream. It was hard not to taste the treats! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are not helped within 12 hours, they can die, so daily checks are essential. 

After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children, as animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of farming is the constant work; cows must be milked twice daily, making it hard to take time off. Rosemary only gets about three days of vacation each year. Farming may seem romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is unstable, and she wouldn’t want to rely on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many successful musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a remarkable trumpet player by the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new compositions. When you meet him, he appears youthful and energetic, reflecting the lively sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a television feature was made about his career, filmed in both London and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo and began his musical journey with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but enjoyed Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother arranged for him to take lessons from the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, someone who was passionate about the trumpet and always seeking new ways to improve.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to create a perfect one. There will always be some flaws, and no two mouthpieces are identical. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them. From the start, he had a unique sound that was recognizable, which he considers his first achievement. Unlike John Wallace, a prominent British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and collected his records. His parents supported his ambition to pursue a career in trumpet playing.

At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson suggested America, it was considered too far and risky, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud reinforced Hardenberger's belief that playing in an orchestra was not for him, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience. Thibaud encouraged him to participate for experience. Hardenberger prepared for the first round and advanced to the second, where he was familiar with most pieces. However, in the final round, he faced a challenging concerto that had intimidated him before. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even when he felt he played poorly, people were still engaged.

Hardenberger's honest view of his talent might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what makes his communication with the audience special, believing that trying to explain it could diminish its power. He feels that the true strength of music lies in its ability to move people."

A. The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insights, making it a challenging but rewarding read.

B. Harriet is a composed, middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe, although physically recovering, becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him consumes her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

C. This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, vividly imagined through the daydreams of the young protagonist, Throfinn Ragnarson. He suddenly disappears from the story but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

D. After his recent success, the author has written a sequel filled with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's outlook on life remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie supports her in her entertaining manipulation of friends and suitors. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the underlying sadness in everyday life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright moments.

E. Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time adrift on ""the desert cities of waves."" The author employs striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which can be both isolating and enlightening."
CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who share their experiences in different professions, discussing the positives, negatives, and their daily routines.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7:00 am, and arrive at work by 8:00 am to start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries last about three hours, but some can take all day. There have been times when I’ve worked for ten hours straight without a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about the next day’s tasks. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it is incredibly rewarding, making up for the times it doesn’t. From 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain procedures to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to communicate with them, although time constraints can make it challenging. I usually leave work between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm. I am on call some nights and weekends, always carrying my bleeper. During holidays, I often worry about my patients for the first few days and dream about surgeries at night. I struggle to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. I work in a team of three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My work is mostly about production, with only 10-15% being actual design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, and deadlines are always tight. Lunch is at 1:00 pm for an hour, but I often work through it with sandwiches. It feels great when clients appreciate my designs, but it’s disappointing when they reject my hard work. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be much later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7:00 am, but on days when I meet long-haul flights, I get up between 4:30 am and 5:00 am. I might go for a bike ride or swim around 10:30 or 11:00 am. Since chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I pay attention to my diet and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. Clients often ask for recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing me to plan my routes. While most passengers are polite, some can be rude. I have built good relationships with my regular clients. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11:00 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7:00 am, leave home by 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11:00 am, we take a break for a big breakfast at a local café. In summer, I may work until 10:00 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden design, I usually schedule a consultation in the evening. We focus on using old materials to create gardens that look historic. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren’t appealing. However, it’s very rewarding to see a garden we designed bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, leaving me exhausted at the end of the day.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. As the assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I ensure that contractors follow the schedule and safety guidelines while minimizing environmental impact. I coordinate with site professionals and solve problems as they arise. The contractors start work at 6:00 am, so my first task is to check in with the clerk of works about what happened overnight. The rest of my day involves responding to their updates, reviewing paperwork, and answering design questions. I usually take a half-hour lunch between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we monitor the contractors' work, it can lead to conflicts, so maintaining a good relationship is crucial. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but I act immediately if something urgent arises. I typically leave the site around 6:00 pm and am always on call."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Discuss Their Typical Workday**

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am to reach the office by 7:30 am. My job involves managing customer development programs for our credit card users. I launch and oversee the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I maintain contact with current card users, attract new ones, and build partnerships with companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle advertising for the membership program across Europe, meeting with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have many meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to address any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by reviewing the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes daily, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these represent people's hard work, so I aim to provide constructive feedback. I can tell if the sound fits our record label. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, selecting songs, producers, and additional musicians. I also share my vision for the album with the marketing team. I manage budgets and expenses. I leave work by 7:00 pm at the earliest, and I often attend concerts in the evenings, sometimes seeing up to five new bands in one night. After a concert, I might visit an artist in the studio. Most of my social life revolves around my work, and I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail, look at my schedule for client meetings, and see who shows up. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and love making sales, knowing the furniture will go to a good home. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, sourcing them from auctions, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with our full-time restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the industry and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle the accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I leave work at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working about an hour and a half at one station, then taking a half-hour break before switching to another station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle around 1,000 movements daily, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic regulations between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. This job requires full attention, so if I feel unwell, I don’t hesitate to take a sick day. The work can be stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. My first task is to start the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate lunch breaks for staff. In the morning, I assist customers in finding and ordering books. I enjoy helping customers, although it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss upcoming titles with them. I need to estimate how many copies of a new title we might sell. When we want to feature a new title, I ensure it arrives on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, during which I shut down the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, warning clients about potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly to gather information. I write the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on specific events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax afterward; I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Charge of Your Work Life**

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others, drives change, and guides people towards a common goal. Leadership is not about physical traits like height, nor is it just about being smart. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about getting things done through enthusiastic and engaged people. A key part of being a good leader is being able to express your ideas clearly and confidently. Dixon emphasizes that a leader should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born with the ability to lead; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve those goals? A good leader motivates and supports you, while a bad leader makes you feel unimportant and withholds information. The good leader leads effectively, while the bad leader simply manages poorly.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers prefer to work within established limits, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, states that a good manager can keep a struggling company running, but a good leader can revitalize a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, improving your leadership skills can be beneficial. Here are some important lessons:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and values. When you feel inspired, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a valuable part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is important, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, take the lead instead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

F. Leadership doesn’t just happen; it develops through taking initiative, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will automatically win over your colleagues; it might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Understand when your leadership is crucial and how you can help others grow as leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine trapped deep underwater. The interactions and modest bravery of foreman Bud and his team remind us of similar heroes in Howard Hawks' films. The film's design and special effects are outstanding, but the dialogue and character development are lacking. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the Guadalcanal battle, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different perspective compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is more traditional, focusing on a single soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife, which is portrayed more harshly than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
This entertaining swashbuckler, loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, stands out among musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a cunning villain, while Vincent Perez is a lively hero, even if his role is brief. Daniel Auteuil, though perhaps too serious for a light-hearted film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama clichés with such charm and energy that it doesn't feel tiresome.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film tells a somber story. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a historical exhibit. Jan Decleir portrays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless in evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the plot, but the filmmakers focus too much on period details, neglecting the dark and powerful story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill, especially in sound editing, where every sound is clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever there is a quiet moment, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
Promoted as featuring ""forty-eight international stars,"" this three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck involves four directors and 23,000 extras, making it feel overly ambitious. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news of the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is an impressive logistical achievement, it is best experienced on the big screen. The video version loses much of its impact."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**: *Compelling Evidence* by Steve Martin is truly engaging. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to establish his own practice after leaving a prestigious law firm. He unexpectedly ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are gripping, with uncertainty about the outcome until the very end, and there is a surprising twist in the final pages. This is an impressive debut in a competitive genre.

**BOOK B**: *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement, introducing Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church intrigue, and serious murder, but we are confident he will uncover the truth. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit lengthy, but it remains very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**: *File Under: Deceased* by Sarah Lacey features a unique new detective, Leah Hunter, who works as a tax inspector. She finds herself in a position to investigate when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing criticism and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, Leah proves to be resourceful and impressive.

**BOOK D**: *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker follows Spenser, a clever private investigator, as he helps his friend Hawk remove drug dealers from a struggling neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is sharp and quick, and while there are fewer deaths than usual, the story includes more philosophical elements. Parker consistently delivers high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**: *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn as they investigate a burglary and attack at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's straightforward writing style and keen observation of unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F**: *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by the husband-and-wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, leading the lawyer to become a victim as the story unfolds. The novel skillfully combines elements of romance, wealth, and violence to create a captivating suspense story.

**BOOK G**: *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw introduces actor Philip Fletcher as a potential victim. A humorous cast of characters comes together to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels uncertain about the direction of his career. While Shaw usually entertains, this shift from dark comedy to farce does not quite meet his usual high standards.

**BOOK H**: *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best work in a while. It follows Canadian police as they pursue a clever bank robber who targets female tellers. The story builds tension slowly and effectively, and the portrayal of the intelligent, troubled robber elevates it above the typical detective novel."
CAE_57,"I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but at 34, I feel nervous. I have traveled before; after university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened: I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my paycheck. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 

Now, I have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship and don’t have strong career ambitions, so I feel I should make the most of this freedom—if only for my friends! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the football season to start?” 

Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their established lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says there’s a growing realization that adventure is available: “People who always say, ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are realizing they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.”

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a last chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I return, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!” 

For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was transformative. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.” While there are many reasons for traveling at this age, some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today’s workforce is more flexible. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Larger companies are even allowing career breaks, knowing that trained employees will return instead of going to competitors.

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of ordinary travelers, notes that more thirty-somethings are reassessing their lives. “If you’re unhappy with your job—and many people are—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t for life. Travel allows you to step back and think about your life.” 

Is this desire to travel just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he’s running away. “It’s more about running towards something. I want to pursue my own interests.” However, he does feel some anxiety about leaving behind his comfortable routine of going to the office, greeting everyone, and enjoying a cup of coffee.

I share Ben’s concerns about leaving a structured life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, “This is common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel.” It may have taken a nudge to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll take pride in having embraced life fully. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"**Transforming Home into a Workplace**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the technological changes in the field. In this piece, she shares how she turned her home into an effective workspace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was fading away due to technology. Looking at my resume, I saw that I was stuck in the past, using a typewriter, which felt outdated. I worried that no one would trust me with a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I lacked. I felt more likely to host a seminar on nuclear physics than to design a page on a computer. I was known in my family as the technophobe; even basic calculators confused me, and I struggled with the video timer.

I knew I had to act quickly to fill the gap in my career. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a local newspaper competition and, surprisingly, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with people from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I created a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. This setup allowed me to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

My children were already comfortable with computers from school, while I was more cautious, fearing I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn't very skilled, I learned the basics, and it turned out to be logical and straightforward. With persistence, I improved a little each day. I recently began freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to balance both work and family life.

How has the computer helped me? In school, my desk was always messy, and I often lost important notes. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. I use spreadsheets to track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, seek information on forums, and discuss working from home with others globally.

However, working from home has its downsides. It can be isolating, and household distractions often take priority. When the children are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Yet, many people in my neighborhood are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment, but also for the convenience of avoiding daily commutes.

As we move into the next century, a report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical home computer user as 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have additional devices like CD-ROMs and laser printers. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the curve. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities in cyberspace are endless."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened.

You can't miss the new Museum of Scotland, located at the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh. It features a large yellow sandstone tower and unique, wedge-shaped buildings topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more cautious or even critical. Now, as the inside prepares for opening, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.

Forget debates about whether the museum tells a national story or follows a timeline. The answer is yes; it presents a rich tapestry of stories linked to valuable historic objects, with a timeline to help visitors navigate without restricting the displays. Importantly, it does not let national pride overshadow its treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the silver from Holyrood chapel.

The main concern is whether visitors will find the museum engaging enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes a visit should be enjoyable and visually appealing, aimed at those with little prior knowledge. Despite this openness, Clarke insists on authenticity in the exhibits. He rejects overly imaginative recreations of the past, stating that they misrepresent history. The public deserves the truth.

At this museum, what you see reflects what experts know. The challenge for visitors is whether the stories of the objects can be communicated effectively through explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, with only about 30 computers available throughout the museum. With less than three days before the opening, it remains uncertain.

Some aspects are clear, though. The stunning views of Edinburgh Castle are breathtaking. Inside, the layout is striking, with galleries connecting in various sizes and shapes, featuring pale walls designed to resemble large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light pours in through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space where visitors can reflect on each item.

Thanks to a 12-member Junior board of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum includes a Discovery Centre. The group wanted a way to interact with the displays. While they didn't get that, they did secure a dedicated hands-on area for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition gallery. Consequently, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, set to change every three years. It features a mix of items chosen by Scottish people and notable figures that have significantly influenced life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions ranged from electric guitars to televisions and favorite toys. While this idea is entertaining, it feels somewhat superficial and does not fully address deeper issues. However, the computerized collection of personal stories and memories will launch next week, which may add depth.

Overall, Dr. Clarke is correct in saying that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it is impressive from the inside and top, but whether it fits well in its location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"**The Future of Print Media**

The term ""transition"" suggests a smooth change from one state to another. While change can be intimidating for some, it usually implies a gradual movement from the present to the future. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and often uncomfortable. Many believe this change is inevitable, as print newspaper sales are declining while online visits are increasing. For instance, major newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, while their website traffic continues to rise.

Yet, the situation is more complex than it seems. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers revealed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies daily. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. Interestingly, news and current affairs magazines, which many thought would struggle in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend is seen in the book industry. E-readers like Kindle are becoming very popular, with significant sales growth this year. However, when bookstores assessed the value of physical books sold in the past six months, they found only a slight decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that both digital and print formats can coexist.

The idea that young people are completely abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe show varying trends: Britain has seen a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, while Germany's decline is only 7%, and France has experienced a mere 3.1% fall.

These differences indicate that the situation is more complicated than the advocates of digital media suggest. In the past, analysts believed that rising online advertising revenues would support the transition to digital newspapers. However, with digital ad revenues now declining, this assumption seems outdated. Many US newspapers have introduced paywalls to charge for online access. Interestingly, offering a print subscription along with digital access appears to be an effective way to attract paying readers. Print remains an important tool for selling online subscriptions, as print ads generate significantly more revenue than online ads.

Maintaining both a print edition and an active website is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print media still holds significant visibility, while gaining attention online can be much more difficult."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most fascinating subjects for photography. A photo that includes a person is usually more interesting than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes change how people behave.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Have people stand at different angles and distances, and if possible, at different heights. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious you are. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their photo taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel flattered but can also become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, and they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to maintain this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to capture a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of direct eye contact, you can have the subject focus on something in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it allows the viewer to see what the subject is interested in. Candid shots can be very engaging, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be striking, the background can add context and interest. When including a background, avoid irrelevant details or blur them to keep the focus on the subject. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people are interacting—talking, laughing, or working together—can lead to great photos. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams in action make for appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical connections, like a hand on an arm, to show relationships.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the entire background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. An elevated camera position can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed photo against a nice background is good. However, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, creating lasting memories."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her unique perspective on art.

Unlike many artists, Sarah does not sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes that the artwork itself is what matters, not the artist. She is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting interview, as she admits, ""I just don't like to shout about myself."" When asked about being photographed, she reacts with surprise.

After some time, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the conversation turns lively and entertaining. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, following two years of intense drawing at art school, where she learned valuable skills. Although she studied graphic illustration and worked in publishing, she found her true passion in trompe-l'oeil after working with a well-known decorator, Jim Smart. He encouraged her to try this style, and she quickly became dedicated to it.

Sarah emphasizes that trompe-l'oeil is about observation and life experiences, rather than formal teaching. She believes that one never truly masters an art form, as there is always more to learn. She is candid about her weaknesses, such as her struggle with painting bread, which she feels never looks right. She also admits to having difficulty with measurements, especially when working on a large project like the ceiling of a chapel.

Despite her self-doubt, Sarah's talent is undeniable. Her trompe-l'oeil works are exceptional and stand out from others in the field. She has completed many significant projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her art is inspired by architecture, such as a dining room designed to resemble a Venetian palace or a painting that creates the illusion of additional rooms in a flat.

Sarah understands that trompe-l'oeil must do two things: first, it should draw people in and trick them, and second, it must engage their imagination. She believes that the artwork should also reflect the client's personality. She enjoys collaborating with clients, as their ideas often inspire her work. Many of her clients become friends, especially since she spends a lot of time with them during projects.

Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who take risks by allowing her creative freedom. Despite her modesty, she is always busy with new projects. She reiterates her preference for being understated, saying, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" However, her work is anything but quiet; it deserves more recognition, and I am happy to share her story."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the essential 'people skills' needed to succeed in any profession.

A. The workplace is changing. We are now evaluated by a new standard—not just our intelligence or qualifications, but also how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly important in hiring decisions and promotions. It helps identify who is likely to excel and who may not. Regardless of our current jobs, these skills are vital for our future employability. This new measure is different from what we learned in school, where exam performance was seen as crucial. Now, it assumes we all have the necessary knowledge and skills for our jobs. Instead, it emphasizes social skills and personal traits like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—collectively known as emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For years, these qualities have been referred to by various names, such as 'character' and 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This term generally means the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and those of others, using emotions to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people mistakenly think it only means being nice. However, it can also require being direct and honest, even when it’s uncomfortable. Emotional intelligence is not about expressing feelings freely; it’s about managing them effectively to help people work together towards common goals.

C. More companies recognize that fostering emotional intelligence is vital for effective management. In complex jobs, emotional intelligence becomes even more important because a lack of these skills can limit the effectiveness of a person's technical knowledge. While some individuals have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that promote teamwork gain a competitive advantage. In today’s work environment, which values teamwork and customer focus, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job worldwide.

D. Unlike IQ, which remains relatively stable, emotional intelligence can grow throughout our lives as we learn from experiences. Research shows that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and developing empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often referred to as maturity. Not only can we learn emotional intelligence, but we can also add these skills to our toolkit for navigating the workplace. This is especially important in a time when job stability seems uncertain. While emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human element can hinder overall effectiveness."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media profit from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has truly changed how citizen photography works. As news often breaks on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms for images during fast-moving events. However, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without getting permission first. Although there is guidance stating that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, the question of whether this is ethical remains debated. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, highlighting the significant role of UGC in the future of media. To maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that individuals are fairly compensated for their work and that permission is always obtained.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that has been around for two thousand years. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, physical manipulation, and exercise. While acupuncture can treat various health issues, it is particularly noted for its effectiveness in relieving pain. Many general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it for this purpose.

**Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine**

Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, known as Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to a specific organ, and many smaller ones that distribute Qi to every cell. When the flow of Qi is disrupted, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a consultation, an acupuncturist will assess your Qi by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and looking at your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and lifestyle habits, including diet and sleep.

**Acupuncture Points**

Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body, which are linked to the meridians. These points may not be near the area of pain. Patients often report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is adjusted, which indicates that the needle has reached the Qi. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more used less frequently.

**Scientific Understanding of Acupuncture**

While Western doctors may not fully accept traditional Chinese medicine, many acknowledge that acupuncture can help relieve pain. Scientific studies suggest that acupuncture may work by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain or by releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Acupuncture is often sought by people with chronic pain when other treatments have failed. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-surgery pain. Acupuncturists also claim it can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Applications of Acupuncture**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over two millennia, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped some Western doctors recognize its potential. In China today, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, including tonsillectomies and heart surgeries. It can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or alongside medications. While some patients report significant pain relief, experiences can vary. Acupuncturists argue that acupuncture has fewer side effects than traditional anesthetics and allows for quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**

Evaluating acupuncture through clinical trials can be challenging, but studies indicate that 50 to 80 percent of patients find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate, although they recognize that it may not work for everyone. They suggest that patients with long-term pain may need six to seven sessions to feel significant relief, though some improvement can often be noticed after just two or three visits.

**A Holistic Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine have different perspectives on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering not just the symptoms but also the overall health of the patient. They spend time diagnosing the underlying issues affecting the Qi and consider external factors that may worsen the pain, such as weather conditions. This comprehensive view is not typically taken by conventional medical doctors.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using the principles of traditional Chinese medicine can lead to deeper healing, which is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist who can refer you to a medical doctor if further investigation is needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she carries an air of quiet confidence. One can easily imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she had not chosen to write detective stories filled with unexpected twists. However, it quickly becomes clear that her confident demeanor masks her shyness. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is somewhat based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh prefers to solve crimes alone, just like James prefers to write in solitude. She needs complete privacy to write, no matter where she is.

Despite her success, she is too humble to agree that she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, even though millions enjoy her twelve major detective novels. She admires the work of her close friend Ruth Rendell, especially her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. The books she enjoys most are often by female authors like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers great novelists.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up in Cambridge after her family moved there when she was 11. She met her husband, a university student, in Cambridge, which is why she chose it as the setting for one of her novels, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman. She shares that her life has had its challenges, including the struggles she faced when her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II in poor health. To support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane, she worked long hours, which left her little time to write, despite having many ideas. Fortunately, her husband's parents helped care for the children during those tough times.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent eleven years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. During her time in forensic science, she became accustomed to seeing dead bodies, but her interest was not in death itself. Instead, she was drawn to the structure and craft of writing a crime novel. She has always loved reading detective stories and knew she wanted to be a writer.

James did not want to write about her own traumatic experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a valuable training ground for becoming a serious novelist, as it allowed her to explore human nature while keeping her own life experiences at a distance. She believes that writing detective stories helps bring order to chaos. Solving a crime affirms the value of life, even if that life is not admirable. Ultimately, she notes that no one truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can significantly influence whether you are considered suitable for the position. Handwriting analysis, known as graphology, is recognized as a legitimate science in many places. Researchers suggest it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can also reveal emotional and psychological states. 

Graphology is increasingly used for career guidance and as a supplement to job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to evaluate the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the effectiveness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes it deserves more attention. She argues that handwriting can reflect psychological traits and some medical conditions. According to her, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental abilities, whether someone should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a deceitful or honest character.""

Ms. Marne claims that graphology can be particularly useful in identifying potential criminal behavior. She notes that criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly formed and sometimes illiterate. Many criminals come from challenging backgrounds and show signs of emotional development issues, which can be reflected in childish handwriting and repetitive letter formations. 

She states, ""I can determine if people are honest, manipulative, or trustworthy."" For example, young male offenders often have tall ascenders in their writing, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and aspire to great success. Graphologists can also predict if someone is under extreme stress or has violent tendencies, and they can even identify potential suicidal thoughts. 

Ms. Marne explains that heart and lung issues can also be detected through handwriting. While one sample may not provide enough information for a diagnosis, changes in handwriting over time, such as a previously stable signature becoming shaky or disjointed, can indicate serious problems. A significant emotional disturbance may also temporarily alter a person's signature.

She describes various handwriting traits that reveal psychological characteristics. For instance, people whose letters connect like threads may be clever but deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting shows confidence and creativity, while disconnected writing often indicates a solitary personality. Small signatures can reflect feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter ""i"" may indicate a desire for attention. Heavy crossings of the letter ""t"" can suggest intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Ms. Marne believes that it takes six years of study and experience to accurately analyze handwriting, along with empathy and intuition. She feels more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific discipline, and she is optimistic that this will happen soon. She claims, ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without needing to ask potentially misleading questions.""

Despite these intriguing claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the writing style taught, and that it holds no deeper significance."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and comfortable chairs are essential for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a recent survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies work conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their assessments.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very basic; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly onto the street. Surprisingly, the small team of seven people seems happy and has few complaints. They adapt to the weather by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to how they would at home. This may be the reason for their contentment: they have created a cozy work environment without unnecessary rules.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and often leads to poor posture. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule that includes office tasks, client meetings, and presentations, which helps prevent fatigue and boredom.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Employees enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They feel the office is ""just the right size""—small enough to know what others are doing, yet large enough to focus on individual tasks. The office is attractive and promotes both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, partly due to a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, and the chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are excellent. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with plain grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most employees have been there for over five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by rearranging desks to facilitate information sharing and displaying project updates on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** Reactions to this office are mixed. It feels like being in a glass case, surrounded by many similar spaces. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers, the air quality is surprisingly good.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and uninspiring. The desks are barely adequate, and not all chairs meet ergonomic standards. Many computer screens are on low desks, which is not suitable for modern equipment.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. The office has many awards on display, but the wood paneling and brown carpet create a dull atmosphere. However, the office is lively and busy.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many issues. The air conditioning is poorly controlled, leading to uncomfortable temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most desks are too small. Dust is a problem, as it collects in many areas.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is more suitable for a workshop than an office. Many chairs are old and do not support proper posture, especially for shorter users. 

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is filled with old brown chairs and dirty carpets. There is a lot of room for improvement—cleaning is needed, individual achievements should be recognized, and air conditioning must be fixed, especially with so many smokers. During our visit, there were few conversations, and everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, accessible to everyone, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks daily. This ancient practice has turned into a large industry. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but since it is considered food, it must meet the standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today’s gum is mostly made from synthetic materials, including pine resins and softeners that help maintain flavor and improve texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women particularly liked mastic gum for cleaning their teeth and freshening their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, marking the beginning of commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and elastic, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, efforts to grow sapodilla commercially have not succeeded. As the demand for chewing gum increased, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, live a difficult and dangerous life. They trek for miles to collect sap from scattered sapodilla trees in very humid conditions. The environment is harsh, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One particularly troublesome insect, the chicle fly, lays its eggs in the ears and noses of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros can quickly climb a mature tree to create a path for the sap to flow into a bag below. They then carry the sap back to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is formed into bricks.

Life at the camp is also tough, with a boring and often inadequate diet based mainly on maize, accompanied by a local alcohol made from sugar cane. Despite these challenges, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.

As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have shifted to synthetic ingredients to lower costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps with relaxation, boosts energy, and reduces stress (soldiers in both world wars were often given gum). The most significant claim is that it helps reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, can harm teeth. Our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, acting as the body’s natural defense. Gum manufacturers suggest that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva production.

Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to create the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - Ghanerao Hotel, Rajasthan**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the peacefulness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The amenities are basic, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - Hermitage Hotel, Mount Cook**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I discovered it by chance while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we had to walk down. To my surprise, we found this hotel at the bottom, set in stunning, wild countryside. Arriving exhausted and finding luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter, was an unforgettable experience.

**C. MAURITIUS - Paradis Hotel**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. Although the hotel is large and offers many free water sports, you can easily find solitude on its nine kilometers of private beach. Swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, and the hotel becomes hidden behind palm trees. In the evening, as the sun sets and everyone leaves, you can feel completely away from it all.

**D. ST LUCIA - Ladera Hotel**  
Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most stunning views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and remote, situated 1,000 feet high, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel features colonial-style decor, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture, and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - The Splendid Hotel, Istanbul**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is an ideal escape from the noise of Istanbul. Just an hour by boat, the islands are peaceful, with no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings from the 1920s. The hotel, painted white with red domes, resembles a historic hotel from the French Riviera. Although it is a bit worn, it still retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - Chateau d'Etoges, Epernay**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau surrounded by a moat with swans. This chateau, which was a family home until recently, has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, along with complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - The Fairview Hotel, Nairobi**  
The Fairview Hotel is a rare find in Africa, offering comfort without excessive luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers recovering from safaris and planning their next adventures. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and inviting rooms, and decide to stay longer. The hotel has apartments for those who want to settle in for a few months. Set on Nairobi Hill, it feels far removed from the busy city center, making it a perfect spot to enjoy the stunning African sunset while sipping beer and anticipating a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - Hotel Splendido, Portofino**  
The Hotel Splendido was first signed into by the Duke of Windsor, and since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet wealthy guests, but the hotel, which was once a monastery, remains splendid. It offers simple yet delicious food and features beautiful Persian rugs and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"The Hotel Inspector, Sue Brown, evaluates hotels as her job. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection. Just one minute into the annual check, problems arise at the Globe Hotel, although the staff are unaware. The receptionist is busy quoting room rates to a potential guest and ignores Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue comments quietly. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake during the arrival phase, one Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't just any three-star hotel,"" she argues. ""It has three red stars, so I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide published by her organization.

Even before the cold welcome, the atmosphere feels off. Access from the parking lot is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor to the hotel entrance. ""Again, not what I expected,"" Sue remarks. Could it get worse? Yes, it can. The receptionist cheerfully informs them, ""We have no record of your booking."" It turns out that out of the 15 rooms, 12 are empty that night. One available room is on the top floor, but it does not meet Sue's standards: it feels stuffy, and there is a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

When she started her career, she earned a reputation for being tough. ""I was known as 'The Woman in Black,'"" she recalls, ""which is funny because I never wore black. And I’ve never been too tough."" However, the next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. His face shows fear. Before she says anything, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think there's a blocked drain,"" he sighs. ""The whole floor might need to be replaced.""

Sue kindly suggests that, in addition to fixing the plumbing, he should guide his staff to avoid directing guests to that lounge. ""It might be better to lead them to the other lounge,"" she advises. Greaves nods sadly and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback is meant to help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who provided information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the standards to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, encouraging Greaves to ask, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue's response is, ""Don’t serve a collapsing pudding."" Greaves’ brief excitement fades.

Sue's job is to express the complaints that many customers are too afraid to voice. ""Sometimes, it can be very sensitive. I remember a woman complained that I got her son fired. All I could say was the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers."" She receives letters with false accusations, from being overly critical to demanding bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says.

Sue must not only share her findings verbally with the hotel manager but also send a detailed written report. After all, the hotel pays for her insights (there is an annual fee for being included in the guide). However, being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. It is good news for Greaves that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to ensure improvements have been made. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,"**Seven Summits: A Mountaineer's Journey**

Doug Scott, an experienced mountaineer, shares his incredible experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit, Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, discussed sleeping bags, which seemed odd since they were alone. Doug attributed this to a lack of oxygen and even found himself talking to his feet, which were getting cold. He remembered climbers who had lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Their main concern was not just survival, but how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug reflected on their time on the summit ridge and felt grateful to be climbing with Dougal, who inspired confidence in him. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Considered one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier in April 1976. They spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized the challenge ahead. They followed a route established in 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. Climbing ""alpine style,"" they carried everything on their backs. After facing tough conditions, including a wet sleeping bag and strong winds, they finally reached the summit, feeling victorious.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro due to a free ride. They got lost in the dense jungle, which was concerning because water was scarce. On the second day, they found a rock pool marked by rubbish, which was a relief. They attempted a challenging climb but decided to take a safer route to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met fellow climber Phil Erscheler. Phil suggested they join his group climbing via the Polish Glacier, a less crowded route. After waiting out bad weather, they set off. The glacier was icy and treacherous, so they chose to take the standard route instead. They faced strong winds but successfully reached the summit and met other climbers who encouraged Doug to pursue the Seven Summits goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never set, creating a unique atmosphere. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite harsh winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg and traveled to Terskol, near Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they took a cable car to 3,900m and walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they had reached the summit but discovered there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team aimed to establish a new route and connect with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of potential danger from bandits, they set out to climb. On May 12, the weather improved, and they reached the summit by 11 am. Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit, marking the end of his incredible journey."
FCE_15,"**Style Merchants**

Style influences many aspects of our lives today, from clothing to home decor and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest trends for fashion enthusiasts this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to steer clear of traditional, stiff designs and overly frilly styles, opting instead for simpler looks. Ingham has been sketching and designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he attended fashion school, where he learned how to cut and sew clothes. However, you don’t need to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening gowns, updated with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, Ingham offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, a staple in women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh, contemporary twist.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail, who previously worked for an art dealer, has no formal training in jewellery design. She began creating her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked, which led her to start her own design business in 1990. Now, her jewellery is popular among many celebrities. Her signature style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond, and that is when I began working with them.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Just four years after entering the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson has had two of her handbag designs chosen for a major exhibition, despite only having taken an introductory art and design course. Her bags, handmade in the UK, are not just functional; they exude glamour, whether made from luxurious calfskin or rich silk. The combination of style and quality makes a Grimson bag truly special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous individuals. He understands that most women want a natural look that they can manage at home. His unique approach ensures that clients don’t look like they just left a salon. However, this relaxed style comes at a price—£250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Leveraging his celebrity status, Peter has launched his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who can’t visit his salon to achieve their desired looks at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and serves as a floral consultant for a large supermarket chain, providing floral ideas for top restaurants. Remarkably, she has no formal qualifications in floristry and left her teaching job ten years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern and simple floral arrangements have won numerous design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also enjoyed successful lecture tours in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements today should be simple yet striking, avoiding excessive leaves, which can be too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, she emphasizes that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses, a project that took nearly two years and involved extensive research into what customers want. This approach has allowed the hotel to install advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to keep track of their preferences. This system helps the hotel provide a special experience for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will particularly appreciate the technology in their rooms. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables and renting televisions and DVD recorders, allowing for easy upgrades.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel features 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are inviting and cozy. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The dining experience is also exceptional. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who previously earned two Michelin stars for his restaurant in Dublin, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change allows him to create a modern kitchen and offers better parking than his previous location. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant adds value without financial risk. With its combination of technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_24,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to create detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days, and then I bring in another one to continue the painting. Sometimes, it can take a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and it's a hectic time,"" she says. However, she finds the gradual decay of flowers fascinating. For instance, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, and after a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always had an interest in plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really into gardening back then; I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in some flower shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden features many plants from distant lands, yet they thrive just as well as they did in places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed approach to her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she understands that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

In March, strong storms caused many trees in the Brackham area to fall. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. This change upset many residents who preferred the town's traditional look. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, he was too ill to notice because he was suffering from bronchitis for the first time in his life. 

When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. But Pelham, believing the police needed him, ignored her advice and tried to keep working. This decision made him forgetful and irritable. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor, and he had no energy left to argue. Soon after, he was at the pharmacy getting antibiotics and then back home, where Molly sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the night, Pelham was too weak to fully understand. Later that evening, he asked if the house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then covered himself with the sheets. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics started working and he felt better, that he noticed how much the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room.

The Pelhams lived in a large house with a big garden, which they had bought without regrets. The garden had given them a sense of privacy. Before the storm, the walnut tree had provided a nice view from the living room, creating interesting patterns of light and shadow that hid the worn furniture they had brought from their old home. Now, without the tree, the room felt too bright, exposing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was also unpleasant; the tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its unattractive purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham asked his wife weakly. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. ""I've been saying this since we moved in. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. That year, storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. This snow almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. However, in the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. The wind blew fiercely up there, while in our valley, we only felt sudden gusts that made the trees sway, but their branches remained strong.

Despite the inconvenience of the snow and wind, we were more worried about the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by the dams built many years ago. Soon, the snow began to melt, and we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These ominous grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and rising, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we focused on the river, which was becoming fuller and more turbulent each day. The melting snow was washed away by heavy rain, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and nearing a dangerous level.

Then, it happened—after many years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a mini Niagara Falls as water surged over the dam and rushed into the stream below. The river became wild, with water pouring down towards its lower stretches. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it, threatening to overflow its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay within its limits. Thankfully, our hopes were fulfilled as the dam held, and the water levels began to drop.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amounts of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stay behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the impressive clouds above the valley and appreciate the river's power without fear. Thanks to the dam, we feel our home in the valley is secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing film articles for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviews of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but since Tom was not mainly a journalist, he was not very careful in choosing his team. 

Initially, he wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need special knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to discuss which artistic works we should review, and there would be guests to keep the atmosphere friendly. At that time, it felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. I even thought a millionaire was helping me personally and pretending to hire me, reflecting my low self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with my review, I felt embarrassed.

Tom's idea of a team of critics for the arts did not work out as planned. Although it was a good idea, we didn’t meet as intended, and everything was done over the phone. It turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so I chose to specialize in film. Without Tom's initial support, we might not have developed the current system, where I write a detailed weekly piece, usually about one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn’t have enjoyed the typical film critic role, which requires reviewing every new film. That routine would quickly make me feel bored, and I would dread sitting through films I didn’t like.

The freedom I have allows me to expand my arguments or, during a dull week, to create something interesting from little material. But what is my role in the public eye? I believe people choose films based on stars, marketing, or the director. There is also loyalty to certain genres. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a critic's opinion. So, if a film review isn’t really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel I need to be “right” about a movie, nor do I think there should be a set number of “great” or “bad” films each year. My job is simply to present an argument. I am not a judge, and I don’t want to be one."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably female. This is a chance to work with someone who could be an Olympic champion. The partner should be very enthusiastic about distance running (regularly running 15 kilometers), distance swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (a love for cycling 100 kilometers is helpful). It is essential to be able to do all three activities without taking a break.

Triathlons are becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. They attract large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. While it may be exciting for spectators, what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, has not yet learned the common phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes use when asked similar questions. She explains, ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike while still wet. Of course, you get cold. After the 40-kilometer bike ride, you have to run 10 kilometers, which feels long when you are tired. But it's really fun, and it's all worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 years old. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we found ourselves at the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried the whole time I was running.""

Despite this setback, she is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would end, but I fear that if I stop just once, I would want to do it again."" Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, while most people would stop when they realize they can't go any further.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That's why I'm working hard to improve."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will pay £1,300 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (which is on sale for £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, there is a cost to her dedication. Her intense training has made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she admits. ""I'm not really into parties. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do keep in touch with the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we discuss our times and achievements.""

Where will this strong focus lead Melanie? She has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" which involves swimming 750 meters, cycling 20 kilometers, and running 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher competitions than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's interesting, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember: only collect items you truly love.

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans collected pebbles, which they wore as necklaces. These pebbles, admired for their shapes and colors, were among the first objects gathered for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, this desire to collect has not changed. Children today still collect stones and seashells simply for their beauty.

I have been a collector all my life, gathering everything from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I attended a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by others. I was captivated by these items. Interestingly, I am not alone in my interest; many adults share this passion. 

People collect for various reasons, and one idea is that for some, collecting is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, it is simply a joyful activity. One notable collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and man-made curiosities, like coconut shell cups and carved ivory beads. Another famous collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. 

You don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected diverse items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, always searching for unique examples. I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. 

I once collected 350 American rag dolls, exploring the USA to find different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, looking at the ruins of my furniture and collection, unsure which loss hurt more.

I find it fascinating how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet adds value to items traded in markets. As certain small objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now considered valuable, especially if kept in their original boxes. Sadly, I discarded both the boxes and their contents!"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work**

Four people discuss their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This involves planning, designing, and promoting the exhibition. I research the exhibition topic and talk to key people to identify the main themes and goals. I decide which objects and images to display and ensure the public understands the exhibition's purpose. This includes planning interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I also coordinate with engineers and electricians to ensure the exhibition is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform the public.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents to help students learn the routes needed to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, around 50 students are in class, figuring out the best routes, including one-way streets and turns. I step in when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they approach the test, I give them a simple route but challenge them to find alternatives due to road closures. This encourages them to think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job involves answering phone inquiries, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. I occasionally visit our main office, but I mostly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about marine life. I take them out to sea to help them understand the underwater environment, which often changes their perspectives. I feel fortunate because conservation is my passion, but working for a charity means I constantly seek funding, which limits what I can achieve.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is diverse. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain a stock of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and sales with co-publishers. I work with a dedicated team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, leaving less time for more interesting tasks like product development and design."

Every June, we traveled to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a large house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did so very tastefully. Strafe discovered Glencorn for us. He found an advertisement when the Malseeds were still promoting their place. One evening, he suggested it to us and read the details. The previous summer, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was a disappointment because the food was terrible. 

The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. My real name is Dorothy Milson, but they call me Milly. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, as the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to where the Malseeds used to live in England. We often think it’s a funny coincidence.

“Welcome back!” Mrs. Malseed said, smiling as she greeted us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall, which always smells of flowers. “Arthur, take the luggage up,” she instructed the old porter. She named our rooms after flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when few guests come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that, while her husband handles repairs and redecorating.

“Welcome, welcome!” Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. He greeted us warmly in the Irish way, smiling with his twinkling brown eyes, making us feel special, not just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was perfect. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. “You look younger every year!” she said, making everyone laugh again. 

Arthur led us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other guests at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. 

In the morning, we planned to walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this routine well because over the years, we had developed this pattern. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."
FCE_67,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in traditional wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views her job as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a great way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. After having her own breakfast, she prepares a hearty meal for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. Once breakfast is finished around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski, enjoying the slopes until about 4:30 p.m. 

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner, taking a shower first. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., followed by coffee at 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes starting the next day with a messy space. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make the week enjoyable,"" she notes, while acknowledging that some weeks are less pleasant.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start their night at a place called Bananas, then move to G Jay's, and finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, especially when she has to cook breakfast with a headache.

On Sundays, breakfast for departing guests is served by 7 a.m. After they leave, Sarah quickly cleans the chalet, stripping beds and preparing for new guests. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new arrivals, who usually come around 4:30 p.m. They often seem confused and full of questions, which Sarah finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, she helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. As dinner time approaches, she prepares for her next shift, sometimes enjoying a drink afterward, but often she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she claimed to be six years older. One day, she visited his factory wearing overalls and large shoes, with her curly hair framing her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

Several times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed particularly serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to learn how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how fascinated Marie had been by the steam-heated brass hands used to shape the gloves, which she called ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" she said. 

""You should visit one if you want to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. They are basic places. The technology has improved, but it’s not much different from what it was hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; there are artifacts from 6,000 years ago found in Turkey. The first clothing was just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is an expert on leather; you should talk to him. He can talk for two days about gloves. Glovemakers are passionate about their work. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?""

""I can't say I have,"" she replied.

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" he asked.

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child.""

He laughed at her answer. She was innocent and eager to learn, reminding him of Marie, who was much taller than Rita but shared her good-natured intelligence. 

""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will take you through the entire glove-making process. Come on! We’re going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""
FCE_71,"**Is It a Tough Job?** Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she must travel around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss, but there is one small issue: she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she confesses. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde, which felt too cramped with its small windows. When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London, handling routine tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, and planning travel. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her working behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he prefers caddying because golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which averages between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You're not just carrying bags; you're giving advice, using your knowledge, and trying to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, which made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are valuable to TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to taste food at top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most beloved children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. Having been a farmer, I understood the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called *The Fox Busters*, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work for them,"" he explains. ""I usually write in the mornings, but I don't wake up at dawn. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning—all with one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop, which I dislike. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to respond to all of them, but I now have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were processed into boards for building, there stood an old two-story brick building. Surrounding it were large piles of soft sawdust, creating golden mounds that extended to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs dangling over the edge, gazing at the lake. Suddenly, Michael challenged them, saying, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he leaped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted, calling them cowards to encourage them to jump too.

Still laughing, he watched as they hesitated on the roof, looking nervous. One by one, they jumped down, relieved to land safely. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, sharing jokes until one of them suggested they go back up and jump again. Although they were not very excited, they climbed back to the roof and began jumping off in a determined manner. Soon, only Michael remained, while the others called up to him, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?""

Michael wanted to join them but stayed at the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning foolishly, wondering why the drop seemed so much longer this time. For a moment, they thought he was just joking, but then they noticed him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten before jumping, but when that didn't work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. As time passed, the boys grew impatient and started to laugh at him, tired of waiting and aware that dinner time was approaching. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't move, they began to leave, still teasing him.

""Who started this?"" he called after them, but he remained on the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He stayed there alone for nearly an hour as the sun set, growing larger and more orange as it sank beyond the lake. His clothes were damp from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was silent; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone.

He arrived so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you won't come home, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a hint of gray in her hair, and a patient smile. Although she spoke firmly, Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, barely heard her; he was still imagining the grinning faces of his friends and hearing their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change their careers seek help from a careers adviser. You will need to write a brief personal history and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. Afterward, you will receive a summary of the results, along with career suggestions and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organization that provides career advice. Taking the career test felt like being back in a science exam. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I reminded myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was difficult to see how the psychometric tests could accurately represent me. The tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long discussion with an adviser. Based on our conversation and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, although I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m glad I never became a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean a complete shift. Last March, after losing her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney sought help from Career Analysts. She said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to reflect on my career. I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial situation,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, she decided to use her existing skills and transition to a role that suited her better. She is now a Public Relations officer. While she believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, they helped her clarify what she truly wanted to do. She has recommended the service to several friends, all of whom are satisfied.

Not everyone finds success with career advice. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I was at a point in my career where I felt lost. I hoped a careers adviser would suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either meant a significant pay cut or required a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had shared the same information with a friend, they would have given her similar advice."
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental clinic in Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he examines their teeth. Jerome points out that ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain, instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has worked to create a space where people feel comfortable. For instance, he decided not to wear a white coat, as many associate it with pain. He believes dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This approach may surprise many, as most people think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome explains, ""If patients are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his innovative relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the initial check-up, patients sit comfortably on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then, the headset switches to a special camera that gives them a visual tour of their mouth.""

Interestingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their dental visit. Another important aspect is that the clinic smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it has a pleasant orange scent. Jerome explains, ""When people enter, I want them to realize through all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the clinic very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the top priority. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It may feel a bit unusual at first, but as long as patients are relaxed, it is not painful.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned is that when you make it easier for the patient, it also makes it easier for you,"" he says. He believes his patient-focused approach is part of a gradual shift towards a less formal style in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this luxurious treatment, and it’s easy to see why. The clinic feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is now a major global industry worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, accounting for eight percent of all chocolate sales. Only Christmas sees more chocolate consumption. 

Although large-scale chocolate production started in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often mistakenly called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also referred to as cacoa and cocao beans.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it more enjoyable when mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but this recipe did not reach the rest of Europe for another hundred years.

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made by melting solid chocolate blocks in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids, leading to the creation of milk chocolate.

At the turn of the century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French elegance. However, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising that linked it to the health benefits of milk from the English countryside, making it a competitor to luxurious French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain seems to have stabilized at about four bars per week. This has prompted manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One recent strategy is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are transformed into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who are bored with traditional snacks.

On the other hand, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, consider the challenges faced by those who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a skilled artist. He still has many interests, such as paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating beautiful objects from shells, a skill he has enjoyed developing over the last ten years. As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is clearly the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them,"" he says. ""I never intended to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so others could see my art. They even spoke to a gallery owner."" This led to a successful exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday, featuring 86 pieces, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Cooke claims he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes his work is unique, and the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

Cooke wishes he had started this art earlier in life, as he feels he could have created even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels physically limited compared to when he began. However, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own techniques and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he explains, yet the detail, color variations, and symmetry in his work seem very intentional.

Cooke's search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him beyond his local beaches in Norfolk to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of damaging the environment. ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them much faster than I can gather them. The sea also breaks them up. I would never take shells with living creatures in them or dive for them. Once the creatures have left, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty he creates from the shells he collects."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who models and appears on magazine covers. When she is not working, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

The receptionist at Kira's agency told me she would be late. I thought about all the negative things I had read about models, like being difficult or vain. I worried she might not show up at all. But when Kira arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, accompanied by her mother. She wore a simple black dress and trainers, showing no signs of being spoiled. Kira seemed friendly and approachable.

Since models under 16 must have an adult with them, her mother was there, looking proud of her daughter. Kira seemed a bit surprised by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter a modeling competition. Kira initially said no, but her sister sent in some photos anyway. When Kira learned she was a finalist, she was at school. This achievement boosted her confidence, and she performed well, winning the competition. The Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Kira now faces the challenge of balancing her modeling career with school life. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some classmates make rude comments about her success, saying she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this unfair, as she remains humble despite her achievements. She explains, ""People think I’ve changed just because I’m a model, but I’m still the same person, just more confident.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day, making it hard for her to make plans with friends. However, her friends understand and don’t complain about her busy schedule.

Kira has the talent and support to have a successful career ahead of her, even before finishing her school exams. As I wrapped up the interview, I asked her what she would do if she didn’t have her looks. She paused and said, ""I’d like to do what you’re doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the warm lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are sure they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more metres to where it is concentrated.""

They have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their journey began when Terence read about gold deposits worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While studying 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the most promising land to explore. After clearing away plants and discovering gold pieces in the rocks, they spent the last ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft.

Now, they are running low on money. Having spent their savings on this dream, they need to convince an investor to contribute £50,000 to dig a bit deeper to reach the gold. Chris Madden mentioned, ""At the moment, this looks doubtful, although we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys last week, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold seekers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are right, it would encourage more visitors here, but if they find gold, I hope millions of people don’t come and disturb the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has significantly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the opposite side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It’s adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I’ll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which involves studying the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she descends into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration, diving three kilometers down to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are accustomed to these cramped conditions, where they cannot stand or move freely, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last up to 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency and they need to ascend quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. Rachel notes, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.""

Rachel recalls her first experience in the vehicle. She climbed in on a ship's deck with an instructor, who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would handle being in such a confined space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands, where there is a large area of underwater volcanoes emitting black smoke. The Russian team was there to drop off scientific equipment for a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on the 'black smokers,'"" another term for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel describes a frightening moment during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion, creating a loud bang that shook their vehicle. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were overwhelmed with relief— they were still alive!

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, witnessing something no one else on this planet has ever seen. I studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD, and seeing them in person was an incredible experience."""
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with foreign schedules, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I told myself as I returned home. I repeated this every year after. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. 

Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. Carrying all your belongings in a rucksack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be set aside along with your paperback and socks. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. 

A system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is quite special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize the full potential of this train ticket; we thought it was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of continuous travel was too appealing, as there was always another country just beyond the border. And the extra miles? They cost us nothing. 

We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. In planning our own schedule, we focused only on the most accessible sights. It was a chance to avoid guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to get by and enjoy ourselves, just like most other Inter-Railers with whom we shared train corridors, food, water, money, and music. 

The thrill of travel comes from experiencing a place that was once just a name. It feels like the city you arrive in didn’t exist until the train pulls into the station, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by witnessing Europe firsthand, observing the changing landscapes and different lifestyles, can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means little until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be dull. While the train journey may not reveal new discoveries in the world, it offers a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail provides the best chance to appreciate this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."
FCE_37,"Text: 'Arriving at an airport in another country only to find that your luggage is missing can be very disappointing. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. If you are in a different climate, you may have to wear clothes that are not suitable for the weather. While airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, it is common for travelers to experience this issue at some point. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it is not always possible for them to ensure that your checked luggage travels on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Airlines require passengers to check in early to give enough time for luggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to switch between flights, and these are often extended to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well, but extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which may disrupt the baggage system. Human errors, such as losing a destination label, can also happen. These problems are more likely at large airports, known as 'hubs', where many bags are handled. For instance, last year, Heathrow airport in London served over 41 million passengers, with nine million transferring to other flights. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to walk a mile between terminals.

Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have issues. The risk of losing luggage during plane changes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers make quick connections to Latin America. To reduce the chance of losing your luggage, choose direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight, and make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, including flight numbers.

If your luggage does go missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a stunning blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a peaceful atmosphere, much like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, leaving a strong impression despite its small size. 

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep affection for this bird is evident in his struggle to explain what attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess transformed into a bird. Another story suggests that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this tale. Although kingfishers display various shades of blue, they do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers. Their vibrant colors, combined with the fact that these birds are shy but can be observed from a distance, create a perfect opportunity for photographers. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he draped over himself while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him four more years to capture his first good photograph. During this time, the European kingfisher became a central part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream filled with kingfishers, but school limited his time with them. He missed classes and considered himself an ""academic failure."" Nevertheless, his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, did not go unnoticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, later becoming an assistant editor, and eventually a freelance wildlife cameraman.

Now, Charlie dreams of creating the ultimate kingfisher film—one without narration, just beautiful images that convey everything. He prefers a simple approach and enjoys photographing parts of the kingfisher's wings. His thoughts drift as he reflects on the colors of the bird he has spent over half his life observing, which still captivate him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that his work can never fully capture the depth of his connection with the kingfisher."

Giving directions to an orchestra is challenging. Anne Inglis interviews five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna and unexpectedly ended up filling in for an absent assistant. This led to her conducting an orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. ""I wasn't nervous,"" she said. ""I have always felt confident in front of an orchestra."" Manson, originally from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after two unsuccessful attempts. Reflecting on this, he feels fortunate about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have been forgotten."" The competition opened doors for performances and an assistant role with a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being labeled as a competition winner. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned,"" he said. Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra have invited him back, which is crucial for his career.

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she said. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. A turning point for her was starting lessons with Sian Edwards. ""I realized she was my size, unlike the larger conductors I had learned from before, which made a big difference."" Kani appreciates the complexity of opera, noting the various personalities of singers and the many challenges involved.

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, describes his journey into conducting as surprising but fascinating. He began as a resident musician at an opera house and learned from skilled conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's *Agrippina* from the piano at a festival, an experience he had never tried before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like,"" he explained. Vignoles values every experience he has had in music and is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys.

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, then a young assistant conductor, and recommended him to his agent. Now 32, Marshall found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He faced challenges, including professional musicians who were too relaxed during the performance. ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best outcome,"" he said. Marshall believes many musicians do not need much guidance from a conductor, but he is not afraid to express his needs. ""I've never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to do it, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are considering taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids enjoyed the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young children, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere and better scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were unsure what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still felt there was more to explore. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, which looked like it would get you wet, but it didn’t. Toy Land was also a lot of fun for younger children. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not boring. It was very clean, and the staff were excellent. When I couldn’t sit with both girls on one ride, a staff member kindly went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am quite timid, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t try the Big Leap, but it looked thrilling if you are brave. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it less exciting, but they were the right age and enjoyed it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we definitely felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie found the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on multiple times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We noticed that the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World, and we wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting businesses in rural areas.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and employs four full-time staff. She moved from London to the countryside with her husband when their children were young. Christine wanted a job she could do from home, so her husband suggested she start a design business. Although it required a lot of money and was challenging at first, she managed her finances carefully and communicated with her bank manager about spending. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. Her business remains small, and most customers pick up their orders directly.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum, but after moving to the countryside, she decided to start her own business. She creates a collection of 50 cards that she sells to museums. Although working from home means there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn, she enjoys her independence. She relies on word-of-mouth for customers and does not advertise. While she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more benefits than drawbacks in her situation.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing, and her income increased significantly in the first two years. However, due to an economic downturn, she had to let go of her six employees, which was difficult because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and collaborates with women who work from home. She must be flexible with her prices and explore new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago to save money and because she loves rural life. She enjoys the freedom to work at her own pace, although 80% of her income comes from international deals, requiring her to take calls at unusual hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to separate work from home life. Tessa publishes children's books from various cultures and initially felt isolated after moving from London.

E. **Meg Rivers** operates a cakes-by-post business and a shop that generates £250,000 a year, employing six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. After receiving requests from friends and family, she began shipping cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where all baking is done, and she now manages the business side rather than cooking. Her main challenge has been financial, as she started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are talented composers and musicians, while their father, John, makes musical instruments. 

John and his wife, Hetty, are schoolteachers in South Wales. When they needed a cello for their son Paul, who was ten at the time, they found that buying one was very expensive. John thought about making a cello himself. He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years. 

After trying to make violins and violas, John successfully created his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers that it turned out great. John made another cello for Paul later, which he used until recently. John has now retired from teaching to focus on making instruments full-time, creating up to twelve violins each year. One of his violins was even sold to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo, which he considers a great achievement.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano: ""As soon as I could reach the keys, I played,"" he recalls. However, he soon became interested in the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin because John played the viola and needed another violinist for his music group. Paul tried the violin for a short time but preferred the cello after being inspired by a cellist in his father's group.

Huw, now 22, also found his own path in music. He appreciates that his parents were supportive without being pushy. Instead of feeling overshadowed by Paul's achievements, he saw them as motivation for his own success. Huw is now making a name for himself as a pianist and composer.

Paul has achieved great things with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. He played his father's cello until last year, but now he has a new cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 

Paul jokes that his father's cello might need 50 to 100 years to develop the same power as his new one, which is already 304 years old. Soon, he will perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. He believes that his performance style will remain unique, regardless of the cello's history.

However, Paul won't be able to watch his performance on TV because he will be playing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills because they interact with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies regularly. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden position, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. He says, ""It helps that I still farm with my parents, so I understand farmers' issues and they can't fool me!""

His farming background also prepares him for the physical aspects of the job, such as building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers, butterfly larvae, and birds' nests as a child and now realizes how farming has changed the countryside. He believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government instructions.

When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. Both groups wanted things done in their own way. Now, they are communicating and understanding each other better. Gareth says, ""We are at a turning point, and it only takes a small step to bring them together.""

Gareth's work focuses on conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting and caring for trees, and working with tenant farmers. He aims to complete tasks efficiently and enjoys seeing projects finished, although he spends about half his time on paperwork and bills.

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys every moment, especially interacting with the public. However, he finds some visitors frustrating. ""Some people come in, demand everything, and leave as if they have a right to it. Being polite to them can be annoying!"" he admits. But, as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense.

If you have plenty of common sense and enjoy outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just be aware that there may not be a position available on the Lleyn Peninsula for quite some time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. When I spoke with her, she was busy preparing for the World Championships next month. Her day included teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her if people stared at her while she trained. She replied, ""I’m so focused on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slowing down out of the corner of my eye, but that’s it.""

Kendra explained, ""My life right now is all about being at my best for the Championships. I follow a strict schedule to get as fit as possible."" This will be her fourth World Championships, which will be the largest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always won against them, but they will be exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" Currently, the England team is ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only get one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become more intense and faster. Players are now more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose. But once the game is over, we become friends again."" 

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It’s crucial that we think and train like world-class players. As captain, I believe it’s important to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra mentioned, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned. I decided a while ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their abilities. Some parents might not recognize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help academically gifted children, musically talented kids often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is seen as less important.

Children who are musically gifted, or whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established recently. These schools create a supportive environment for children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their musical skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend about one third to one half of their day on music-related activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their day is filled with a limited academic curriculum focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with small class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which allows them to spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some drawbacks. One major issue is the cost, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 a year for boarders. Each school tries to help families with scholarships and financial aid for exceptionally talented children. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question whether it is wise to admit children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

It is important to note that separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some children may lose their musical abilities during their teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide support when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some have concerns about the limited academic focus, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before pursuing a specialist education. Children who are also academically gifted can thrive in a regular school with a strong music program or by combining a standard school routine with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, along with orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to create detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes, it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and it's a hectic time,"" she says. However, she finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For instance, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, and after a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they transform with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in florists. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden features many plants from distant lands, which thrive just as well in her garden as they do in their native environments, like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she understands that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in traditional wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views her job as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she explains.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. After having her own breakfast, she prepares a hearty meal for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. By 9:30 a.m., after the guests have finished breakfast, she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By around 11 a.m., she is ready to ski herself, enjoying the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids napping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, which consists of three courses, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee follows by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes starting the next day with a messy space. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week fantastic,"" she says, noting that some weeks are not as enjoyable.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start their night at a place called Bananas, then might visit G Jay's and finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, ""when you definitely don’t want to be cooking breakfast while feeling tired.""

On Sundays, Sarah starts work earlier, needing to have breakfast ready for guests by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast, stripping beds, and preparing for the next group. If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which she finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she may chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_12,"**Changing Lives with a Stranger**

Mandie Currie, a zookeeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my outfit for Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. I first went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and I felt rushed here when I could be quietly spending time with an animal. Some fashion team members seemed stressed, but my job is not very stressful. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I found it funny to think that I would normally be cleaning cages or handling rats. I am interested in how magazines operate, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. They gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While petting an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably organizing clothes in a cupboard. By five o'clock, I was dirty but had a fantastic day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I enjoyed being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was a lot of fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn’t include hard physical work or careful planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so I don’t plan to leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and distributed medicine. I thought I might faint during some tasks, but I surprised myself by handling it well. The camaraderie among the nurses was great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less meaningful compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn’t pleasant, but it gave me a strong sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I wore it, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage them.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I noticed that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has motivated me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Memories**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as possible. There is a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It offers stunning views of the sea, and no matter the weather or season, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see beautiful gardens and homes, making you feel like you are peeking into the lives of the wealthy. The passengers are always lively, a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking scenery.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many wonderful train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I had never been on a train. London Waterloo was the first station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On that train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was lovely, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unpredictable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. The driver often waited for passengers, even if it took days. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen, like a dream.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains as children, but that’s not my story. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire, mostly filming on an old, well-kept section of the line maintained by volunteers. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, everything felt the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Are you trying to get your work published? If you’re unsure where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" One important thing to remember is that you need to research your target market and learn about publishers while also improving your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world.

No matter what type of writing you do, it’s essential to know the markets you want to reach. You can do this in several ways, but the best method is to read as much relevant material as you can. Visit your local library and explore nearby bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what types of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

As time passes, you should keep updating your knowledge because new publications are always emerging—editors change jobs, and magazines shift their focus. Publishers are always looking for fresh talent, so as a writer, you need to provide what they want. 

If you’re unsure about what to write, for example, if you think you might want to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories, a rather limited market today. Get recent copies of those magazines and learn about the types of stories they buy, paying attention to their readers' expectations. The editor’s goal is to meet the needs of their audience.

Writers often ask me, ""This has been rejected three times—am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone, but it’s likely that the work isn’t ready for publication. I try to give honest feedback while remaining positive. Many new writers are too eager to submit their work before they are truly prepared. If you’ve only written one story or article, it’s very unlikely to be published. This is rare. When you hear about someone’s success, they often have years of experience in publishing or journalism behind them.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, start writing more while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will improve your skills, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your confidence. Instead of discarding any of your work, focus on improving it. I also recommend not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before achieving success.

Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for creative writing courses in your area. If you can’t find one, consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence by connecting with other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible."

On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The usual clean and bright atmosphere of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had left their bags all over the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. 

He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" The girl replied, ""I’m going north, but to New York."" ""Thanks anyway,"" he said and moved on. Now I was really paying attention. 

He asked an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" When she said she was going to Wilmington, he just walked on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia, and I wondered why he didn’t ask me. I guessed he thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He seemed stressed now. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you’re going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five, and looked like a school teacher. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 

They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags like pets on leashes. I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia, not knowing what to do."" 

The woman nodded sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet to see where this was going. ""So I told her to stay put in the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" 

I thought this story sounded suspicious. Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? The woman asked, ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" 

""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" I thought this was a weak excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a simple envelope, but a padded one, the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! You couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. I silently warned the woman to be careful."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, shares his thoughts about his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef. John believes that everyone has opportunities in life. For him, it was running a restaurant, and for Gary, it was cooking. When John found out about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it, even though it was in poor condition. He thought it was just right for his plans.

Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembered feeling sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. This made him want to ensure his family had time together. While John managed the restaurant, his wife took care of their children and handled the finances. They lived above the restaurant and always made it a point to have meals together, which helped their sons, Gary and Joe, grow up confident. From a young age, they would interact with regular customers, giving them a strong start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and accidentally knocked himself out. As he grew older, he earned pocket money by doing small jobs. By the age of ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he always had money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone contributes, and John appreciated Gary's help.

Although Gary did not excel academically, he was very talented in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John realized that Gary had a future in catering. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one goal at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told him that if he wanted to achieve something significant, he needed to do it by the age of 30.

At 17, Gary attended catering college. On his first day, while other students struggled, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his tasks in just an hour. He even helped his classmates. John is amazed by how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become and feels very proud of him. He has always encouraged Gary to work hard for what he wants because nothing is given for free. Gary recognized the opportunity he had and took full advantage of it.

As parents, we hope our children listen to our advice. Even if they only remember a small part of what we say, we should be grateful. John feels that Gary has listened and learned from him."
FCE_7,"Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult, almost like finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place is through personal connections. If you know someone who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if, like Jo, you have just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have those connections. You have to stay in a hostel and search for a place. For Jo, Dublin felt completely new and unfamiliar. She felt like she was entering a new world when she took the train to work there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone she knew from school expected her to leave. Who would want to stay in a small, remote town? That’s what she had heard for years. Her friends wanted to escape, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates had moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel run by nuns, believing it was safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm, as they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying a whole week in a hostel. However, Jo was unaware that they were still thinking about her as she responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her workplace and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive. There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary—a red-brick terraced house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. 

""Desperate place,"" she told Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt."" 

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up. 

""Hello,"" said the girl wearing a T-shirt with ""Nessa"" on it. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, looked like a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 

""I’m Jo, I work at the post office and called about the flat,"" she said. 

Nessa mentioned they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs—one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" 

""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People have a strong affection for dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society reports that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds discusses the decline of dolphin populations.

Dolphins are special to us. They are among the smartest animals, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with thoughts of freedom in the ocean. Our love for dolphins has been fueled by television shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest,"" featuring a dolphin named Darwin. Yet, these cheerful images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished waters.

For example, the population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by laws and cared for in marine reserves, but this is not happening. The lack of protection for dolphins could lead to one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.

There are forty different species of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common types are striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two types usually live far out at sea and are rarely seen, so we know little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once frequently seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in small numbers in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few remaining dolphins show signs of stress, such as skin injuries.

Understanding why dolphin numbers are declining is complicated. Overfishing is drastically reducing fish populations, which threatens both local fishing industries and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not have enough time to find food elsewhere. They also risk getting caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing methods often use large nets that can trap dolphins. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on beaches in France and Cornwall, with injuries indicating they were caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also accumulate harmful substances from the sea in their bodies. For instance, pesticides can dissolve in fat, allowing dolphins to absorb them. This can lead to female dolphins producing milk that contains high levels of these toxins, which can poison their young. There has already been a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s contaminated milk.

Another significant threat to dolphins comes from human activities. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels more effectively underwater than in the air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.

Exercise improves your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries and improves specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Additionally, exercise benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something that might catch your attention: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it helps regulate your sleep. It is also effective in managing stress and can relieve certain medical conditions. 

If you’re still not convinced, just think about it—common sense tells us that exercise is good for us. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, and weight training. However, be careful not to overdo it; training too hard can lead to injuries. It’s wise to start slowly and consult your doctor if you’re unsure about what’s best for you.

Good posture is crucial for improving your body shape. Poor posture can make you look unattractive and can drain your energy, making you more prone to minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, picture a helium balloon pulling the top of your head upward. This can help you lift your chest for better breathing and make your body appear slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It increases flexibility and helps you move easily, while preventing injuries from overuse. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, done slowly and carefully.

The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their comfortable homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, Amanda and Owen are some of the hardest to find. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost constant rain, leading to unexpected challenges. Newman mentioned that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their collaboration has produced some of the best wildlife films on television, including a well-received documentary about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time tracking the shy jackal.

This kind of travel is common for filmmakers, who have been exploring the world to capture exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke with Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we usually resolve them quickly."" Neither sees themselves as the leader, and he believes their strong partnership comes from their shared perspective on animals. ""When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But this time, we are more stationary, so we prepare tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packaged food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so meal preparation can be stressful,"" Newman explained. 

Although their lifestyle can be tough, the chance to be in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. He recalled a time when they were filming a lion family, and one lioness would often wander off. When she returned, she would greet all the pride members, and eventually, she included their vehicle in her greetings.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in the field to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" Newman said, ""because we share the same ideas and vision. We aim to create films that are rich in atmosphere, capturing the true spirit of the place and its animals, and that resonate emotionally with viewers. I believe evoking an emotional response is more impactful than simply appealing to logic."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. When I spoke with her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket parking lot. I was surprised by her choice of training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slowing down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra explained, ""My entire life right now is about being at my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to achieve maximum fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra noted, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they have a lot of talent."" Currently, the England team is ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra emphasized that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only get one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become more intense and fast-paced. ""You don’t train hard just to lose,"" Kendra said. ""But once the game is over, we become friends again."" 

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It’s crucial that we all think and train like world-class players. As captain, I believe it’s important to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra mentioned, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned."" She decided some time ago that this competition would mark the end of her playing career. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her last major event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears of joy, knowing her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of her time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which involves studying the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she descends into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration, diving three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, Rachel explains, ""The space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

If there is an emergency and she needs to ascend quickly, Rachel can press a panic button. This action releases a small escape vessel that rises to the surface quickly, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. Although no one has tested this escape method yet, Rachel doubts it would be a pleasant experience.

Rachel recalls her first time in the vehicle, which was on a ship's deck. An instructor guided her through emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a confined space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands, where there is a large area of underwater volcanoes emitting black smoke. The Russian team was there to drop off scientific equipment for a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on 'black smokers,' another term for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion, creating a massive bang that shook their vehicle. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, the relief was overwhelming—they were still alive!

Diving to the ocean's deepest parts is an adventure for Rachel. Each time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before."" After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in person was an incredible experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to become a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believed being on time was very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who worked at the school told her that the Head Teacher commented, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, explains that candidates who take care of their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. While many believe that what matters is inside, it is essential to present yourself well in an interview.

Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Movement and gestures also affect how an interviewer perceives a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our words and facial expressions send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal signals. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also crucial not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, had a great interview for a promotion and was offered the job immediately. She was very excited, but her enthusiasm led the boss to offer her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what you say and how you say it can greatly affect your interview success. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can provide insights into the company's activities. Mentioning an area of interest during the interview can show your enthusiasm for the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall advises preparing a few questions and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She states, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators use short sentences and highlight key points."""

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the City, it became boring and no one was enjoying their work anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, my life hasn’t changed much: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""I started painting as a hobby and found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to leave my job and become an artist felt like the right choice. A career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business from her flat in London. She shares, ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were awful. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even longer hours, so I decided to leave. Many people thought I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. In the fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier and less stressed now, but I do miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He says, ""I was in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found it fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I chose to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I figured out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and spoke to their owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Eventually, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, which is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports**

Four young athletes share their experiences.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many, but I excelled in football and athletics. At 14, I had a chance to join a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn’t attract much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to gain sponsorship, as training can be expensive. I train at home during the winter and then spend three weeks in Florida before the season starts. It’s enjoyable because the facilities are excellent and the nightlife is fun. However, I must be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I didn’t have to, but dedication is essential in this sport. My main goal is to qualify for the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it’s worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. The sacrifices pay off in the long run, as winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I suppose I’ve become somewhat of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Being on a boat with my teammates is always fun. We have a traditional way of celebrating our victories. Some say we act a bit immature when we celebrate, but we don’t seek media attention. Often, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to return home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. It’s important to have a balance; you can’t be focused on sailing all the time. I’m recognized in the sailing world, but thankfully, I’m not often recognized in public. I wouldn’t want to be a celebrity. I do receive many nice letters from fans asking for autographs, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It’s always exciting to step onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. However, at my last tournament, things got a bit overwhelming with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its challenges. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I received too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that contributed to our breakup. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you must be serious and professional. I’m focused on my game now and plan to enjoy other aspects of life after I retire, which comes relatively early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it's the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty for buying unhealthy items but also hates saying no all the time. This makes her feel frustrated before they even leave the house. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but worries that she is not letting them learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when faced with appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance states that most parents care about their children's diet and have ideas about healthy food, although these ideas may not always be correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, as children who only hear about products from advertisements get a very limited view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they must decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but still feels uneasy about how she handles their requests. She has talked to her son about advertisements so much that he now thinks they are not trustworthy. As a result, they have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, explains that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, while they themselves buy rich foods like double cream and chocolate. He finds it enjoyable to buy nice things and understands why children want to share in that. However, he admits that his mood affects how he responds to their requests, making it hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from a six-year-old could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_20,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses, a project that took nearly two years and involved extensive research into what customers want. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to track guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide a special experience for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the standard 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will particularly appreciate the technology in their rooms. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. 

As technology evolves quickly, the hotel has prepared for future upgrades by installing extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy replacement with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated as needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished rooms that are inviting and cozy.

In addition to the rooms, the Merrion features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden. The food is also a highlight, with Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, running the restaurant. Moving his restaurant to the Merrion has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant adds value without financial risk.

With its combination of advanced technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need challenges and learning new things to feel energized. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing, which is very expressive and uplifting. If I'm bored, I feel drained and life seems pointless. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a burden. Enjoying what I do helps me feel good, even when I'm tired. I need enough sleep to feel my best. Exercise also boosts my energy, but I sometimes struggle to find the motivation. I do yoga once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, my mood improves a lot. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't rely on healthy eating for energy; I think it's about having natural enthusiasm and a positive attitude. I dislike negativity. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the past two years have been exciting. Being around lively young people energizes me. I enjoy taking photos, even if I'm not great at it, and I like writing lyrics for fun, which helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and being positive in life. Working with kids is energizing because they are resilient and full of energy. Communicating with others boosts my energy—just smiling at someone can create a wonderful feeling. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is transforming a wasteland into a garden. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also motivates me. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if caught, I playfully act surprised, which feels fun and childlike.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""It's important to have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don't enjoy drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found their demands exhausting. You have limited energy, so focus it on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron skates appeared in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the wealthy in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating very popular.

Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. The way you position your body is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is essential in skating, more than in many other sports.

To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outward. As you push off with your back foot, make a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you can keep this up, you can gradually make your movements longer as you gain skill. Learning how to fall safely is one of the first things a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall without getting hurt, stay relaxed to reduce the impact with the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel and then stand.

Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you’ll be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle.

If you watch skilled skaters, you’ll notice how relaxed and fluid their movements are. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise routine. Skating with a tense body can be risky, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent fitness program for overall health."

Seeing a talented child receive a medal can bring tears of joy. Julia Gregson spoke with three young achievers and their mothers about the joys and challenges they face.

A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""Training is very demanding right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I’m extremely tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off, or your body gets stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother**: ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen parents try to push their kids, but it doesn’t work. Competing at Annika’s level requires a lot of time and energy, so she has to want it herself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from around the world and gained confidence through her success.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at age ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents enjoy show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement and fun of show-jumping. Even without my parents, I would still do it because I’m determined. I’m happy they celebrate my wins, but I’m not doing it for them. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team, and my big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's mother**: ""From the moment Sarah first sat on a horse at age one, it was clear she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is very organized and feels completely at home on a horse. Watching your child succeed in something they love is incredibly rewarding.""

E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is Britain’s Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should; I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant, and I don’t talk about my success at school because I dislike feeling embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's mother**: ""Jane played her first game at age five. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. I’m proud when she wins, but if she decided to quit tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to discourage her because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors were. We are starting to recover from the effects of poor diets over many generations. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health and growth. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when they started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be a blessing, turned out to be a health problem, according to some experts. Despite this, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland could support many more people than hunting and gathering could.

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to keep changing their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

Some experts, like Robert Fogel from the University, think we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and shorter, even with good food. If the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be part of an audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this topic. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of television, yet many of us find them mysterious. When we see people getting excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Among all types of live entertainment, studio audiences are often seen as the least important. Some people in the television industry even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience; they come from various backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows aim to attract different audiences for different programs.

Many of us who prefer watching television at home question why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and endure hours of discomfort just to see what they can watch at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on television, which I doubted until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason is curiosity about what happens behind the scenes. However, the most common reason I heard was simply, ""a friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it’s like. We imagine sitting close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and we respond accordingly. While this may be true for some shows, it is not the case for all. As one studio manager said, ""We believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""

But is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed the feeling of being part of live television. She mentioned seeing her favorite comedian live, saying that watching him on TV at home misses a lot of the experience. I, on the other hand, missed seeing the live actors because I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were filmed far from my seat, so I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters most. For many in the audience, it was simply a fun and free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,"**Favorite Places**

**Bruce**  
I prefer landscapes that have some human presence. When I travel, I am drawn to charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. At the age of eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham, located in a beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape school. I enjoyed exploring the rugged hilltops, sheltered valleys, and ancient villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit it today. I used to write about my adventures in a private diary, which was my first attempt at travel writing, a field in which I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by enthusiasts. I always choose first class because it costs only a little more than the regular ticket. The scenery is not breathtaking; the train travels across Romney Marsh with its sheep and alongside a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to—when the train takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers get a glimpse into people's lives as they make tea, wash dishes, or set up deck chairs. I see myself reflected in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage looking into their homes. It is the simplicity of the landscape that captivates me—just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me pay closer attention and search for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coastal area. The beaches are hard to access and filled with rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to admire the power of the sea. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a vast moorland perfect for hiking. There are few residents and visitors, making it a quiet and remote area, which I enjoy. I discovered this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these trips even more special, and it saddens me that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream home—magical, secluded, and romantic. Here, you can only hear the sea, the wind, and the birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals of all kinds. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had prepared a special tank for such visitors, allowing us to admire them and look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their room. The chaos involved our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca, which I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the flailing arms of the children.

In the midst of the confusion, I tripped and fell. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat continued to jump around in a wild, noisy mess. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. 

I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, this same mouse was caught by Domino three more times during its life but eventually died of old age. Feeling encouraged by my success, I examined the snake but found no weak points. 

I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, but without music. Gradually, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked wary. Slowly, I lifted the snake and stood up, walking to the end of the garden. I pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would find a new home.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to attack, it instead slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter. We stood there in the fading light, with my four children, myself, and the snake. My eldest son, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""

I asked the children to gather at the snake's tail and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son, Clay, sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"**Drop Me a Line!**

In our fast-paced world filled with phones, fax machines, and computers, the traditional practice of writing letters is in danger of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter offers a unique joy that no other form of communication can provide. There is a thrill in its arrival, the delight in seeing who sent it, and the pleasure of reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It likely started with the small notes I wrote to my mother. She always encouraged me to write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts, no matter how short or messy they were. When I moved away at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. My father occasionally wrote, and his long, funny letters were always a treat. Most of the letters from home shared everyday happenings about my parents and their friends. While we also made phone calls, it is the letters that I cherish the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. During my youth, I often connected with people who had to work or study far away, and we kept in touch through letters. Surprisingly, this strengthened our relationships. I found it easier to express my thoughts in writing than in conversation. I especially love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. While short notes are nice, receiving a full year’s worth of news is even better, especially when it arrives in an airmail envelope with lovely stamps.

I receive letters from friends around the world, including Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend from my training over 20 years ago, and penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There is also a woman in France who writes to me. If we hadn’t met by chance in a restaurant after a holiday, I would never have had her address to write to her. Thankfully, she replied, and now we have a regular exchange of letters. This helps me improve my French since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited her twice, and she has stayed with us as well.

My greatest letter-writing achievement happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met in person. Everyone was surprised that our correspondence lasted so long, and the local newspaper even featured our story on the front page.

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did for my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into rocks at a significant tourist site in France are being slowly destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on the rocks in Mont Bego, located in the French Alps, are being harmed so quickly that they may not last for future generations. This mountain, thought to have been a place for prayer and worship, features drawings that are around 4,000 years old. These include images of horned cows, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being damaged by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, explains that many visitors believe these ancient images will always be there. He warns that if the damage continues at this pace, there will be nothing left in 50 years. He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and blurs the artwork. Some visitors even break off pieces to take home as souvenirs. Clottes notes that when people cannot take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer. The weather naturally polishes the drawings, but if the sun is shining and visitors cannot see them well, they often rub and scrape them to make them appear fresher.

Other researchers have observed that some people arrive with long sticks that have sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the entire mountain a restricted area, allowing public access only through guided tours. He argues that without such measures, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will suffer.

Clottes disagrees with de Lumley's strict proposal, stating that while it may be effective, it will likely lead to protests from local residents. He emphasizes that the site has been recognized as a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and efforts must be made to preserve it. David Lavergne, a regional architect, also prefers not to close the site. He believes that while it is important for people to see the area, the large size of the site makes it hard to prevent damage. He suggests that financial issues are a major concern, as there are not enough funds to hire the necessary security. Charging an entrance fee may need to be considered, but government funding seems unlikely.

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to access—tourists can now avoid a long walk by using vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the best solution is to cordon off the area and provide guides. She insists that the lack of funds should not stop the plan from moving forward, stating, ""Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing these drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it's the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty when she buys them these things, but she also hates saying no all the time. This makes her feel frustrated before they even leave home. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but worries that she is not letting them learn how to make their own choices. It feels like a no-win situation.

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain items, and arguments about the health risks of sugar are not convincing when faced with appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance states that most parents care about what their children eat and have their own ideas about healthy food, even if those ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, as children who only hear about products from advertisements get a very limited view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother mentions that she tries to discuss food with her children, and while her son is aware of advertisements, he is critical of them. They talk a lot about different products and read labels together. Because of this, her children rarely ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, explains that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, yet they buy rich foods for themselves. He finds it reasonable for children to want nice things, but he still feels annoyed by their requests. His willingness to say yes often depends on his mood and how well things are going in his life.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any lost sales."
FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

In the past, climbers would go to mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches closely as French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is better known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. The ability to hold such events is thanks to new and rapidly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it became essential for top climbers to stay fit. Since they couldn't use cliffs for much of the year, they started to train on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them strengthen their fingers and avoid boredom from not being able to climb.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls specifically for training, using bricks designed for climbing. One of the pioneers was Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He came up with the idea of embedding natural rock into concrete blocks to create climbing walls. Throughout the 1970s, many similar walls were built in sports halls across the country, but they had clear design issues. These walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Additionally, once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to experiment with panels on steel frames. Unlike concrete, which was too heavy for overhanging walls, steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"So, you want to be an actor? If you tell someone about your desire to pursue acting, they will likely mention how risky it is. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are many more actors than there are roles available. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were close friends may think you are making a mistake, while others might support you. Everyone will have different opinions, but this is a personal choice, and you alone are responsible for your journey and achieving your goals.

There are no shortcuts to becoming an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee of success in the industry. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors and fresh talent, along with the excitement and potential rewards that come with the profession.

Many people ask what talent really is. I believe talent is a combination of natural ability and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves courage and confidence in what you are doing and how you present it. 

Where does the desire to act come from? It can be hard to explain why you want to act. In theater, the key moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform, no matter where they are.

When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often don’t have a clear answer. They understand their own skills and techniques, but they don’t take anything for granted. They know that their success depends on their current work, and fame can be fleeting. 

Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. One month, you might be unemployed, working in a store or as a waitress. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. However, no matter how much you want the job, it might not be yours. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of getting roles. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection, which is something no one enjoys. 

From the moment you start auditioning professionally, you are putting yourself out there, showing that you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the role. Ultimately, it is up to you; if you don’t care enough about your career, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago. 

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

Research in Ohio showed that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be beneficial, it turned out to be harmful to health, according to some experts. Despite this, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland could support many more people than hunting and gathering could. 

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to resemble those of our ancestors again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have not changed since 1860, remaining at 190 cm. Additionally, legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing companies must constantly adjust their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

Some experts, like Robert Fogel, believe we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even with good nutrition. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He explains, ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City became boring and no one was enjoying it anymore. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, my work hours are still long, around 80 to 90 hours a week, and I’m still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He shares, ""I started painting as a hobby and found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and pursue art. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business from her flat in London. She says, ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were awful. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even longer hours, so I decided to leave. Many people thought I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. In the fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier and less stressed now, but I do miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He explains, ""I was in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found it fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I chose to resign and travel for a year instead. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and spoke to their owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Eventually, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, which is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**A Winning Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, enjoying their past. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, an ancient game they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and shared it with his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played together, and as Dave recalls, ""we had the best time ever."" 

Later, the family moved to New Mexico, but they kept playing pichenotte using the board their grandfather made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed their old pichenotte board was damaged, so he decided to create a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative wanted one, then a friend asked for another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People watched and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon, they couldn't get up from the table!"" Dave said.

When people began asking about the game's history, Dave researched it. He found that its origins might be in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This game evolved into 'squails' in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. 

Pichenotte can be played by two to four players and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks,' which they flick across a wheel-like board using their fingers. Scoring 20 points is achieved by getting a puck into a small hole, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasse brothers made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity soared. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, leading the brothers to start a full-time pichenotte business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have produced over 450 boards. Made from birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12 kg and is 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable and can handle a lot of use."" 

Each board is sold for $595 on the brothers' website. Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage, but the brothers believe that one day their garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE

When you enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was an empty, overgrown piece of land. For a long time, it was seen as useless. However, through careful planning and hard work by one man, with the support of his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful village you see today. 

During the construction, many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you now enjoy. While machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of manual labor was also involved. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, chosen specifically for this area. Only plants that could survive the salty air near the sea and withstand strong winter winds were used. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who spent nine years creating over 100 models since the village opened in 1972. These models are made from various materials like stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics to endure different weather conditions. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how materials would last over time, but he quickly became knowledgeable himself. 

You will notice that a consistent scale has been maintained, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details in the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and upkeep. The methods used here have inspired other model villages in England and have even been included in college courses on modeling.

All the buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific location. One of the most impressive structures is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower, reflecting the style of manor houses found in the West Country. As you explore the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini-golf course, which is the latest addition.

We kindly ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can lead to hours of repair work for us. You are welcome to take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are allowed on a short lead.

To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these will make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we would appreciate any feedback you have. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more diverse and interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations, as we are constantly updating and replacing them.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"
FCE_69,"Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish photos that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of conduct. While some pop stars do pose for photographers, this is not the norm. More often, individuals in the public eye suffer when their private moments are displayed on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to address such problems. These intrusive photos rarely serve the public interest. For example, how do intimate images of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a photo of a famous actress on a hotel balcony contribute to public safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos, and since she was in a hotel—a place where privacy is expected—she had valid reasons to complain, but she did not take action. It is scandalous that the PCC did not investigate this matter. 

The PCC should also look into a recent scandal involving a pop star's private life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead in addressing these shameful invasions? This seems like a good idea, as it could result in many rulings against newspapers. Such rulings would be reported by competing media, and the public would likely not support the tabloids, forcing editors to stop publishing such content. Photographers would also be affected, as they might no longer be able to afford to hide and take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities.

If the PCC took on the role of enforcing privacy, it would face several challenges. How would it decide when to investigate? Should it encourage victims to file complaints? If a victim chooses not to complain, should the PCC still act? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect the PCC to address any story about them, and they could be upset if it does not. The task is too vast for the PCC to monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines. 

There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is violated, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Many might prefer to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying silent, such as fearing that a worse story about them could be revealed if they complain. In this way, the PCC could become seen as an enemy.

A British comedian faced similar issues when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, nor did he when a photographer took pictures of his family during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper would publish the photos again with a new story about his anger, claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would find it funny. This fear is understandable; many believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. Finding a simple solution to this serious issue is difficult."
FCE_38,"Many college graduates receive advice about starting their first job. This article focuses on what to consider when moving to a second job. We will not discuss those looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those who leave a job shortly after starting. Instead, we will talk about those who are ready to take a significant step in their careers. You have gained some experience and skills, and you have a clearer idea of your career goals.

When choosing your second job, think about your long-term goals. Do you want to specialize in a specific area, aim for higher responsibilities, or explore a broader field? It is important to choose this job carefully, as you should plan to stay in it for two to three years. Future employers will look closely at this job when you apply for your next position. It should demonstrate that you have thought seriously about your career. Most importantly, this job should help you grow, develop new skills, and take on more responsibilities.

If you feel the urge to travel, now might be a good time to do so. You can work temporarily when you return and then find your second job. Employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are less likely to leave again soon.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after graduating from St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors. It was a good first job because they were supportive, and she learned how to navigate an office and improve her word processing skills. However, there was no opportunity for advancement. Eventually, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more capable, and my job has really evolved. From the start, my boss was eager to help me grow. My job title is the same as when I began, but my responsibilities have changed. I now handle most of the correspondence and budgets, and I deal with various inquiries, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own businesses. Brenda includes me in all her work and also assigns me specific projects and events to organize."""
FCE_17,"**Text: The Secret of Confident People**

What is the secret of confident people? They may seem naturally confident, but many will say it is a skill they learned over time. Nina Hathway interviews five individuals to share their experiences.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter’s school. I was nervous but surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I felt very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was a turning point that helped me in many areas of my life.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became overly aggressive and impatient, thinking that was how confident people acted. Eventually, I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work becomes too overwhelming, I don’t feel guilty about postponing some tasks. When facing challenges, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can undermine confidence, so I often have quiet conversations with myself to overcome those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as confident, but the calmer I appear, the more nervous I actually feel. I had to learn to look confident because it is crucial in my job in TV. Interviewing people made me realize that everyone gets tense in important situations, but we feel better when talking to someone friendly. My mother once told me, “Who’s looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about their own appearance.” I find this advice very helpful. I also believe that facing your fears builds confidence. I was very nervous during my driving test, but after passing, I felt I could handle anything.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am well-liked in the restaurant, but I know that not everyone will like me. I focus on liking myself for who I am, rather than trying to meet others' expectations. My company offers many training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. Setting achievable goals helps a lot; it’s better to reach small goals than to aim too high and achieve nothing.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up, even when I disagreed. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.” I also found it helpful to write down points to refer to, like a comfort blanket. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking publicly. The real secret to confidence is reminding yourself repeatedly, “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's a tradition—if the line breaks, the finders keep it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a line of tense competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites shot into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying ability. ""Flying kites isn't too hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how."" I received five invitations that day and decided to accept his.

At his house, I enjoyed cold milky tea and fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he invited me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A narrow boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" It would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was steep and slippery uphill.

When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and thousands of creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First came the wind, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. As I slid downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being washed away (which can happen) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track.

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I will always remember it for the kindness of its people."
FCE_48,"What kind of shopper are you? Shopping is something we all do, whether we enjoy it or not. There are various types of shoppers. Do you know which type you are? Abby Edwards asked several people about their shopping habits:

A. Melanie, 22, dancer: I love shopping! I can't resist spending money. When I have cash, I go shopping and it makes me happy. I find it hard to walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We are both addicted!

B. Brenda, 40, office manager: I don’t like shopping much. My husband does most of the grocery shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don’t spend much time shopping for clothes either. I take my son and daughter shopping, but we all have different tastes, which makes it hard. I rarely buy things for myself, and when I do, I feel guilty and often tell my husband I spent less than I actually did.

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager: I only shop for what I need. I dislike shopping and only go when necessary. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and won’t settle for anything else. Shopping exhausts me, and I’d rather be doing something else.

D. Anita, 35, TV producer: I enjoy browsing occasionally, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and prefer to shop quickly. However, I sometimes make mistakes with my purchases, so I guess I’m a careful shopper who occasionally buys the wrong things.

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary: I really don’t like shopping. I find it hard to find clothes I want, and the shops are too noisy and messy. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often since I receive many of them as gifts. For groceries, I go to the supermarket once a week and get it done quickly.

F. Lisa, 22, actress: I would say I’m a happy shopper. Sometimes I go shopping with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I’ll buy it.

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant: I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t go overboard. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often regret spending too much.

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker: I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too crowded. I consider myself a careful shopper. I have a good idea of what I want before I go, and I take my time to find the best deals.

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager: I don’t enjoy shopping, maybe because I work in the city and the shops don’t excite me anymore. When I have to shop, I go reluctantly and don’t bother trying things on because it’s too much effort. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I prefer to make a few mistakes rather than spend too much time shopping."

**New Artwork**  
The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch painter Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) depicts flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years, as they wait for specific flowers to bloom in different seasons. This artwork was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is currently displayed in Room 25.

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometre. The key difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of money, known as 'currencies', to facilitate more exchanges. Eventually, these different currencies began to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."
PET_46,"**Write a Winning Story!**

You have a chance to win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in *Keep Writing* magazine. Ten other winners will receive £100 each. We are looking for people who can write great stories. The judges include novelist Mary Littlejohn, television reporter Michael Brown, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of *Keep Writing*. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winning story was a love story.

You can write about anything, but here are some tips to help you get started:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, many stories focused on love, family, and friendship problems. However, you should make ordinary situations interesting so that readers want to keep reading. Try to present everyday topics in a new and surprising way.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: If you describe a place or explain something technical, make sure your information is accurate. Only write about things you are sure of.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an engaging way and end it with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your plot carefully and think of something unexpected for the conclusion.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using descriptive language. Help the reader connect with them.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a new rule. Your story must not have been published in any form, including on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. The entry fee is £5, which goes to the Writers' Association. Please make your cheque payable to *Keep Writing* and send it along with the application form and your story to us.

The closing date is July 30, and we will notify the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited chances to study.

After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly gained fame for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have copies of her books, we know she wrote several important works on mathematics. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created various scientific tools to assist her in her work.

During her time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants on Earth. There are more than 9,000 types of grass, and they can be found in every part of the world. Grass is unique because it can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass for food in some way.

One of the remarkable features of grass is its ability to recover quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike many other plants, grass grows new leaves from below the ground rather than from the top. This allows many animals to live together in the same area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh food source."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion and recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since childhood, she has enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never shared her dream of making fashion her career with her parents, who run a supermarket. She believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.

After finishing her studies, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. Although she attended many industry events, she could not afford the designer clothes she admired. To solve this, she began making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends noticed her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. This led her to find a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. The clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned, which motivated her to leave her advertising job. She took out a £20,000 loan to start her own womenswear brand.

Kal's parents were supportive of her decision to change careers, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels grateful for her success, saying, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,"**Sunningdale Hotel**

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has provided excellent service to guests from around the world, welcoming people of all ages and nationalities. Over the past 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed at Sunningdale.

The hotel is located on a main road that leads to the town center. It is about a 20-minute bus ride from the center, and many buses stop outside the hotel. Guests should avoid buses with a blue ""Express"" sign, as they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 well-furnished, centrally heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are located at the end of each corridor. The hotel also features a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are eight pianos available for guests to use. Parking spaces for cars are available in the hotel driveway. Daily newspapers are provided for free, and stamps can be purchased at the office.

Guests staying for long periods must pay for their accommodation weekly in advance and must give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests are given priority for room assignments.

Meal times are as follows: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. For those studying or working late during the week, dinner can be requested until 11 pm by signing up on a late list or by calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices available for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires of any kind (for cooking or heating) are allowed, and guests are asked to be considerate of others' comfort. If you have tapes or CDs, please keep the noise to a minimum, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. Guests arriving by train are advised to take a taxi to the hotel, as it is some distance from the main railway station."

PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway took a train journey from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train travels across the Australian continent, moving from the warm northern coast through vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but this name is somewhat misleading because the train is known for being late.

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide began in the 1920s, with a line built from Adelaide to Alice Springs. However, this line often faced serious flooding, which made it hard for trains to operate. A new line was finished just a few months before my trip. The railway was designed for speeds of up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. Unlike luxury trains like the Orient Express, the Ghan does not focus on providing luxury, although the food on board is very good.

Originally, the railway was built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to Australia’s southern cities via Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent. Completing a transcontinental railway is a rare achievement, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south railway.

As I waited to board the Ghan, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Many of my fellow travelers were Australian retirees who were particularly eager to get on the train. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip in the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Nowadays, climbing the rock is discouraged, and few people do it. Our group simply walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers choose to stop there. The scenery from the train after Alice Springs is not very exciting; it mostly consists of flat land with cattle. However, on the third day at dawn, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was coming to an end, and although the train did not meet all the expectations set by advertisements, it had taken me to some of the most incredible sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be extremely cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first major winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high, making it the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries,' which are large bowl-like areas cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are essential on Ben Nevis because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. 

Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect with no strong winds, there was still a sense of nervousness as we began our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always challenging.

As we climbed, the path became steeper, and my legs felt heavy. Being the least fit member of the group, I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes paused to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start climbing again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the summit of Ben Nevis. This path is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops steeply on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. Unfortunately, we were not so lucky, as a mist had rolled in.

Getting back down to our camp can be just as difficult as climbing up. It is important to read a map correctly because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns navigating. It was only when I was safely inside the tent that I could truly say I enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, similar to our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The construction took several months, and we watched it all happen. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant some beautiful open space was lost. The noise from the construction machines was quite loud, and the builders often had to stop working because of heavy rain. At times, we worried that the building would never be completed.

Now, we have five large classrooms, much bigger than those in our old school next door, which was very old. We also share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a lovely dining room, and spacious changing rooms that we are eager to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, the first thing you notice is that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the students, teachers, and the computers we use. The building is designed so well that it keeps all the heat inside. It also holds sound very well, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof, as it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for our lights and computers comes from a wind turbine located on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very quickly. It is so large that it can be seen from far away! We took some pictures that we plan to share on our website.

Even though we are already using the new building, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. However, the new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

PET_2,"A month ago, I never imagined that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was basic, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn were with Amanda. We all came from different places and none of us knew the area well. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren’t sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing. We switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went caving first. Climbing out was more difficult than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally made it out—covered in mud but happy and excited about our adventure."
PET_23,"Letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday afternoon, I accidentally left my handbag on the bus. Inside were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized my mistake, it was too late to do anything. I felt lost and worried because I am 72 years old and far from home. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what had happened, and he kindly gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he told me I could keep the fare. I made it home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that operated the bus where I left my handbag. He informed me that they had found it and offered to bring it back to me.

I was amazed to get my handbag back with everything inside still there. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me that day. Their kindness and honesty meant a lot to me.

PET_60,"**Sharks**

Sharks are among the most intimidating animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes them very dangerous to smaller sea animals that they prey on. 

While sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are quite different. For instance, most sharks must keep swimming constantly to breathe and survive, which means they hardly ever sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can become completely still. This is a useful method for researchers who need to study sharks, as it helps them learn more about these intriguing creatures."

PET_53,"Joining the Kirov Ballet

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they switched to English, so we were able to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I can understand my teachers.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mother stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I was feeling lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes here in Russia are much tougher, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence to meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. Now that I have settled in, I feel really at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was incredibly cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the locals said that was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

Currently, we are preparing for a new production, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very fortunate to be here."
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to experience the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, it was decided that the long, dark winter could be seen as a positive thing. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a structure made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors.

One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous worldwide. When winter arrives, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the globe come to Jukkasjarvi to construct the hotel for that year. As each section is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first section is completed in December, and each week a new section opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully finished.

Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date depends on the weather, which can lead to changes in the schedule. In spring, as temperatures rise, the hotel melts away. Inside the hotel, the temperature stays between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing, such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves, as part of their stay. It is also wise for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose shoes that are slightly larger than usual to fit thick socks.

If you plan to visit the hotel, you can purchase warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items along with your booking, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture store, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store. There were many special deals, like a leather sofa for £45 (available only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only from 3 am to 8 am). The store's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours. Unfortunately, it had to close just half an hour after opening.

A police officer who was called to the store said, ""We knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly for their turn. Another issue was that there was a long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. I was shocked that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store, which blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were very calm and explained the situation. They had no choice; it wasn't safe. I will return when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had previously dived deeper using a balloon, this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the first woman to break a world record previously held by a man.

A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. Despite concerns about the dangers of free-diving due to several serious accidents, Tanya believes that safety is the most important factor, followed by proper training. While most free-divers focus on one or two events, Tanya maintains a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training occurs in the gym, with the remainder split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her cardiovascular fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, opting instead for fast walking.

When preparing for dives, Tanya usually travels away from home, aiming to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is crucial for her to avoid fatigue, as it could jeopardize her preparation. When not training, she often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research and film projects.

Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, Tanya spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. She feels that her current life reflects her childhood dreams. Being well-known in some countries, she believes people are willing to listen to her views on environmental issues. Looking ahead, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she began free-diving at the age of twenty-five, she is eager to emphasize that she does not plan to retire from the sport anytime soon."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few restrictions. If you can draw something, you can animate it for the cinema. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting for audiences of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry believed that cartoons were only for children. However, soon after, a few directors introduced original concepts. They showed that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Not every cartoon film was a hit, though. For instance, *The Black Cauldron* did not succeed because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this experience, and film companies started to earn significant profits again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson discusses her first role on television. ""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to adapt the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to audition for the role. At first, my mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. Filming started a week after the term began, so I asked the university for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was exciting. It was an incredible experience, and I feel very lucky. After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I don’t come from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I have auditioned for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I felt a bit lost. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I’m going to Greece for the summer with friends."""
PET_8,"When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, my main goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a fast-growing international company. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is shared in this book. I believe our company has valuable insights on how to run a successful business while staying true to our beliefs. This is not just a typical business book or a memoir; it conveys the idea that to succeed, you must be different. Business can be enjoyable, run with love, and contribute positively to society. In both business and life, I want to feel joy, a sense of family, and excitement from unexpected events. I have always hoped that the people working at 'The Body Shop' share these feelings. This book aims to share my ideas with the world. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' or to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."

PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid created by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. To make just half a kilogram of honey, bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers. The color and taste of honey vary depending on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder flavor compared to darker honey.

In ancient times, honey was the primary sweetener because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and enhance athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used to soothe sore throats and is included in many skin and hair care products."
PET_7,"**Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had become one of England's largest towns. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a significant center for various religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be recognized as a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city in England. For the next 300 years, it continued to grow and prosper, becoming known for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days.

Currently, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. The city has a growing student population and is a modern commercial center, being the largest hub for insurance services outside London. Today, Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and several arts and leisure centers. The local football team, known as 'The Canaries', wears green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, residents dealt with a large construction site in the city center as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with water features and many trees. Fortunately, the old open market remains in the city center, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich successfully blends its historical charm with modern advancements."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown significantly. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to participate at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The balloon pilots communicate with each other via radio and light up their burners at the same time, creating a beautiful display known as ""balloon glows."" These glows are great for taking amazing photographs, but you need to arrive just after sunset or before 5:30 AM to see them as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, and even popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will especially enjoy this.

In the afternoon, you can experience a balloon flight over the desert by booking a ride with one of the many companies that offer this service. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a stunning view of the festival.

There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for ballooning. The Sandia Mountains shield the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival entrance. Dress in several layers of light clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but you will need sunglasses and sunscreen during the day. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."
PET_51,"The Eden Project, located in the south-west of England, has become one of the UK's most popular tourist destinations since it opened. The large 'biospheres' on this former industrial site resemble something from a science-fiction film. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, highlighting the important connection between people and plants. It is fascinating to realize how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. The project cultivates over 135,000 different plant species. Regardless of the outside weather, computer-controlled heaters maintain the ideal temperature for the plants. In the Rainforest Zone, the environment is consistently humid due to a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the climates of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone soon."
PET_11,"Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I find it hard to understand why. After all, 500 pages of high-quality original writing for just £6.99 is quite impressive. The majority of the book consists of fiction, including both excerpts from novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable contributions from well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have focused on food in their pieces. I recommend being cautious with Jane Harris's story, Those Nails—it is best not to read it right after eating, as it contains some very disturbing scenes. The collection also features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Additionally, there are excerpts from works in progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, the collection includes a bit of non-fiction, such as a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and a remarkable personal piece by Ursula Owen. Overall, this is an outstanding collection, and I am eager to see what next year's edition will bring."
PET_14,"**No Title**

Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher, believes that the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. She explains that this is when children are discovering the world around them. Living in London, Margaret usually accepts students who are three or four years old, but she has made exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds.

When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class included her children’s five-year-old friends. Margaret teaches her students in groups of about twelve, with each lesson lasting one hour and occurring every two weeks. Additionally, each student has a weekly individual lesson with her. It is also necessary for parents to attend these classes, as their involvement is crucial for the students' learning.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play music by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years, and there is often a noticeable difference between their playing skills and their ability to read music. Margaret emphasizes that her teaching method is not designed to create expert violinists. She often advises students who excel to leave and pursue more traditional violin training."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" follows their previous album, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott has joined as the new bass guitarist, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Additionally, Tom Simpson is now playing the drums.

From the first song, which is a dance track, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance track and is even louder and more energetic. Most of the later songs return to the band's usual slower style. These two dance tracks may surprise many fans, but either could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford showcases his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should appreciate that he recorded these songs before experiencing throat issues, which led to the cancellation of their upcoming tour. However, anyone who has purchased tickets need not worry, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.

In this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in various styles, from the slow songs we know to upbeat tracks that make you want to dance. I did feel that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Nevertheless, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big success and will bring more recognition to the band."
PET_36,"San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, San Francisco Bay, which is a beautiful natural harbor, was discovered by land instead of by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest individuals were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large homes on a hill known as Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous attractions like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the old prison."

Pepys discusses significant events of the time, such as diseases, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his own flaws—like often falling asleep in church or admiring pretty girls. He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they reconciled, as well as his concerns about her health. In addition to reading, he enjoyed music, theatre, card games, and lively parties with good food. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles; he served as a Member of Parliament and was the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not focus on making shoes comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people wrapped around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. 

Originally, all shoes were handmade. While some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are now produced by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to create many more shoes at lower prices, making them available to a larger number of people."
PET_20,"Title: My Journey to Encourage Women to Run

After injuring my back, I had to pause my running career. I wanted to help more women discover the joy of running and build their confidence to participate in the sport. Frustrated by the attitudes of many race organizers, who often complain about the low number of women in running while failing to provide proper facilities for them, I decided to start a running club for women in my community.

I created posters, and soon, 40 women of all ages and fitness levels joined. Most were interested in losing weight, but I don't think many had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't realize that running could be enjoyable, filled with conversations and smiles in beautiful locations, like along a river.

Initially, the women could only run for a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about nutrition and fitness from each other. I wanted to make a positive impact on women's running, and it has been incredibly rewarding to witness their progress—almost as much joy as they have experienced themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns quickly developed, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this, a winter trail was built in 1910 for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothing to gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced dog teams and steam boats as the main transport. However, in 1925, dogs gained fame again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The medicine needed to treat the disease was located in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. At that time, airplanes were new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in the cold. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away on a trip. Therefore, it was decided to transport the medicine using dog teams.

The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail, and took twenty teams just six days to complete. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to navigate through the heavy snow, and Togo proved to be an excellent guide. The final part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another lead dog, refused to go further, preventing the team from falling into icy water. Thanks to this effort, the diphtheria outbreak was controlled, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous 1925 journey. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite the cold, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to experience one of Europe’s most unique hotels. In this hotel, everything—eating, drinking, and sleeping—takes place in rooms made entirely of ice. You can even have a wedding there. The bar is also made of ice, so it is not advisable to place hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags designed to keep them warm in extreme cold. If needed, suitable outdoor clothing can also be provided. The hotel lasts no longer than six months because it melts in the summer, and it is rebuilt each winter. Constructing the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."
PET_29,"**Maria Mutola**

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized she was very fast. 

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand at first because I only knew about football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help improve their financial situation. They agreed to let him take her away for training.

In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had previously refused because she was worried about missing her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother."

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and especially to enjoy the stunning views. The view is enhanced by the Skywalk, a glass platform that extends over the canyon. The Skywalk is 1,219 meters above the canyon floor, allowing visitors to see the beautiful rock formations below. It can hold up to 120 people at once. Since its opening in 2007, thousands have experienced it. To protect the glass surface, visitors must wear special shoe covers. Walking on the Skywalk gives you the sensation of soaring like a bird high in the sky."

The Rocky Mountains stretch nearly the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest but are also found a few hundred miles from the center in the southern regions. While the Rockies are not as tall as the Alps, they are equally impressive. There are many roads that cross the Rockies, but the best way to experience them is by train. 

You can start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful cities. This city is unique because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes away from the city center. 

In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver daily for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains each week, but the journey remains an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you will see some of the most stunning landscapes at night."
PET_42,"**Zoos**

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years, starting with a large zoo in China called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals were trained to perform for visitors, but this practice has stopped. Now, the main goal of zoos is to allow people to observe animals in their natural behaviors. Most cities today have a zoo or wildlife park.

However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters argue that zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, which would be difficult without them. Conversely, critics believe it is wrong to confine animals in cages. They argue that poorly managed zoos can lead to animals living in unsanitary conditions and being fed inappropriate diets."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all experienced performers, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially considering our young age. Musicians from each band even made up new songs right on stage. It was thrilling to watch, but even more exciting when my band performed!  

Our school has a fantastic jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often hang out after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps around the country; I’ve attended a few and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music while also connecting with its rich history, just like the great jazz musicians before us. Our school is fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without their help, we wouldn’t make progress in our music!"
PET_54,"**Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is rare, and when it does occur, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Despite the lack of rain in many recent winters, when it finally rains, the local people appreciate it. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they are sustained by a system of underground channels created in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains throughout the year. Areas that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases.

Traveling further south from Marrakesh, one reaches Skoura. In Skoura, every piece of land is divided into small sections by water channels, which are used to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter provide a beautiful backdrop to this landscape."

When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time work in the circus. They both found jobs with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown, calling himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and return home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away. 

Kath admits, ""I can't say it was easy. There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving our nice house behind. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths."" 

Gareth shares, ""People ask about my education, but from the start, someone has always come to teach me wherever we go. I use the same books as my classmates and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind."" 

As for the future, Kath says, ""It was a tough decision, but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" Gareth adds, ""One day, I'm going to be the main clown in a circus, maybe Bippo's circus."""

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here, you will find all the information you need before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. These flights take you over Antarctica and back. The exact dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the journey, we usually start seeing sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is also a camera near the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit throughout the flight.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot will fly in long 'figure 8' patterns over interesting sights so that everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain will check the satellite images of the clouds and choose the route that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Absolutely! You are welcome to bring all types of cameras. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothing."

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it even better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to enjoy the food we've made together."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She shares, ""I love cooking. I prepared a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of just staying home on weekends. At first, I wasn't very interested, but I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, explains, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents encourage their children to cook when they are young, they will have the skills to prepare meals for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Driving in winter can be dangerous because conditions can change quickly, leading to accidents. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill, and ice may be hidden under melting snow, which can cause you to lose control of your vehicle. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. You can think of it like driving with a full cup of hot coffee next to you—drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to stay alert to potential dangers. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Practice how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Be aware that you might be driving faster than you realize. Generally, you should allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times that on snow, and even more on ice. Always try to keep control of your car to avoid accidents."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London with the plan to study law, but instead, he chose to attend art school. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government supported him financially to study art, which sparked his interest in early Italian artists. This influence can be seen in some of his artwork. He was inspired by the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he aimed to capture this light in his paintings. 

To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark, but he admits he never knows how the final result will turn out. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start with yellow, knowing what I will add on top."" Like many skilled artists, Aitchison makes it seem simple. He believes anyone can use colors since they can be bought, but he focuses on how colors interact with each other.

Unlike some artists, Aitchison does not create sketches before starting a painting. He feels that making sketches might make him lose interest in the actual painting. Instead, he often changes his paintings multiple times before they are complete. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, Aitchison has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any artistic tradition; he simply paints in his own way. Nevertheless, his work continues to inspire young British artists."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" Eventually, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you need to think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever they practice, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit unusual, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical talent—after all, I didn't expect my parents to enjoy the same music I liked as a teenager—but they do perform regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but that hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. This college offers students valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to prepare for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from various countries, study in the mornings. In the afternoons, they participate in meaningful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for individuals with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the remarkable aspects of Atlantic College is its diverse student body, which includes individuals from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the tuition fees are £20,000 for two years, many students rely on grants to afford it. About 25% of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because of government support.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, expressed her admiration for the college's efforts to promote international understanding among young people. She said, ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education through effective methods that truly benefit its students."
PET_47,"**Being an Older Student**

At 32, I have just completed my first year at university. Along with attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to return to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job required little thought. This made me increasingly unhappy, as I felt trapped in my position. I envied the local university students, who seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

Now that I am a student, I find it challenging to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers, as we are the same age, but I know much less than they do. However, I appreciate this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is essential for getting a fulfilling job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. 

Additionally, I enjoy the typical student benefits, such as long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas. I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life has been a wise decision."
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born in 1863 on a farm in Michigan, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he created his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and then made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet lightweight steel, he produced affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_19,"**Rebecca Stevens**

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to successfully climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small apartment in south London. In 1993, Rebecca decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with a group of climbers. She quickly learned that life on Everest is very challenging. 

""You have to carry everything on your back,"" she said. ""This means you can only bring what you really need. There is no way to wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn’t even take a toothbrush. I usually like to stay clean, but there is no water, just snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the happiest moment of her life. This accomplishment made her famous. She has since written a book about her experience, and people often invite her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science television program. 

Today, Rebecca is well-known and has more money, but she still lives in her small apartment in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains."

KET_13,"**Canada Geese**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds would not survive if they stayed there. 

Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents and would not know how to migrate in the autumn. Bill owned a small plane and decided to help the birds learn to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him.

When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way to Virginia. After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home.

This spring, Bill waited for the geese to come back, but they did not arrive. Concerned, he flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way back home on their own!"
KET_16,"**ESTHER'S STORY**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 per jar to her friends and quickly earned back her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not supportive of her jam-making. They believed she should focus on her studies and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling her jam at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where a friend worked.

After two years, her business had grown significantly, and her parents were proud of her. She produced various types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some employees to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens, selling milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to keep them comfortable.

Five years ago, Jenny tried to sell sweaters made from the wool at country markets, but it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which became very popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. This is how Jenny's business began.

Initially, she made the socks at home, but soon she gained thousands of customers. As a result, she started sending the wool to a factory where machines now produce all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and various types of socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers. 

Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. Her office walls are filled with letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"**BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON**

According to the police, most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by over 30% compared to last year. He noted that 67% of these burglaries happen when people leave their homes and forget to lock doors or windows. 

Inspector Saunders mentioned that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are particularly favorable for burglars since it gets dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Many houses are also empty during this time because people are still at work.

To help prevent burglaries, Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday. This can deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when someone is away and to contact the police if they notice anything suspicious. 

""We can also provide advice on how to secure your home,"" Inspector Saunders added. ""This assistance is free of charge."""
KET_27,"Dear Lynne and Tony,

It has been a long time since I last saw her. Thank you once more.

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming began, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These individuals were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, leading to the growth of villages. As a result, some villagers could focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming could be challenging, especially during bad weather, which sometimes left people without enough food. Today, farmers can produce more food, which can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes."

Nicola Peet finished school at eighteen, attended college, and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she began working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later became an air hostess for British Airways. Four years later, she became a manager. Here is what she shared about her job:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time flying. I train air hostesses and assist them with any issues. I also attend many meetings. My usual working hours are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, I first check flight schedules on my computer and then talk to some of the air hostesses. Occasionally, I take long flights to see how the air hostesses are performing. This is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, I usually just eat something and go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""

KET_62,"The Weather People study the weather for many reasons, and it is crucial for various professions. For instance, weather significantly impacts farmers. In the past, farmers would observe the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Nowadays, numerous computer programs assist us in predicting the weather, and people can access weather information on their mobile phones. Despite advancements, many still hold onto traditional beliefs about the weather. For example, some say that a red sky at night means it will be sunny the following day, and others believe that when cows lie down in the fields, rain is on the way."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small town in Canada. They have been friends and classmates for a long time. Like their other friends, they usually enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework; instead, they have created a new computer word game.

The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who struggles with reading. Kevin finds it easier to learn words by seeing pictures and hearing sounds rather than by reading text. Frazer wanted to help his brother, so he and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to develop the game, which is now ready to use.

The game combines speaking and pictures. For instance, when you see the word ""hat,"" there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying ""Hat! Hat!"" at the same time. The boys have received many awards for their game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in purchasing it."

Getting enough sleep is very important. When I return to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, after a concert, I find it hard to sleep because my mind is filled with music. 

Staying active is also essential. Before my car accident, I spent two and a half hours at the sports center five days a week. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups daily. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat healthily. I also drink a lot of water because it is good for my health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I don’t always manage that.

It is important not to work all the time. I love my job, but I enjoy other activities too. In my free time, I like to listen to music or watch TV. Sometimes, it is good to relax and do nothing. Since the doctor advised me to eat better, I no longer feel tired. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day, but I still enjoy burgers occasionally!"
KET_58,"**Bollywood**

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, and it produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, far surpassing the USA. Watching films is the most popular leisure activity for many Indians, with around ten million people going to the cinema daily. 

Bollywood films often focus on romantic love stories, and they include a lot of singing and dancing. These films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. 

Indian actors produce more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films have a production cost of about $2 million, while Hollywood films typically cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers are often short. Amitabh Bachchan, who is considered by some to be India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted nearly 40 years."

I was born in the United States, but I have written many travel books about England. I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years. For the last three years, we have been back in the United States. Our children are now experiencing life here, and I believe they will be happier having lived in two different countries. I enjoy Britain and would like to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is starting college here soon, so it will be another four years before we go back.

Recently, I spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to discuss my new book. Many writers dislike promoting their books by traveling around the country, but I enjoy it. I like exploring new places and meeting many people. This experience is very different from my writing life in the United States. In England, I was driven around in large cars and stayed in nice hotels. It was great because I didn’t have to pay for anything. Everyone was friendly, and I had a lot of fun."

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes were introduced to England over 50 years ago, while the Giant Schnauzer has only been here for a shorter time. The name ""Giant"" is fitting because these dogs stand between 65 and 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs regular grooming. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, but the Giant Schnauzer is typically black. 

Schnauzers originate from Germany, where they assist farmers with sheep herding. They are also employed by the police due to their high intelligence. Schnauzers make excellent family pets; they are friendly and get along well with young children."

Horse racing has been an important sport since ancient times. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in both Greek and Roman cultures. Modern horse racing started in the 12th century when Arab horses were brought to Europe. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses. However, by the early 18th century, this changed; races became shorter and included multiple horses competing against each other. Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball, and it is also very popular in many other countries."

You may have seen these beautiful birds, known for their vibrant colors and long tails, in forests or zoos. Parrots are native to countries such as Brazil, Australia, and India. They typically live in large groups and, due to their fruit-based diet, can sometimes cause issues for farmers. There are many species of parrots, but all share strong beaks and feet, which they use for climbing and grasping food. The largest parrots can live for as long as 80 years. They are quite loud, but they are intelligent and can easily be taught to speak. Some zoos feature parrot shows, where you can watch these birds perform learned behaviors."

At just 29 years old, Howard has a passion for food. 

As a teenager, he often visited restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed these experiences so much that he chose to spend his money on trips to France and dining at fine restaurants instead of buying clothes and CDs. He also collected many cookbooks, claiming to have over two hundred and fifty!

KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, we see police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid much. Around 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people lived in poverty. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, causing people to stay home as much as possible.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of individuals to catch thieves. They were similar to police officers and were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they operated near Bow Street. By 1800, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had expanded significantly and needed more police.

In 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established, consisting of 3,000 officers. Most of these men patrolled on foot, while a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are well compensated, and those who still ride horses earn even higher salaries than their colleagues."
KET_30,"Attention Students: 

Are you interested in joining a camping trip this weekend? We will travel to the forest by school bus and stay at a campsite from Friday to Sunday. The campsite has hot showers, a small shop, and bicycle rentals available. The cost of the trip is £25. Please note that it gets very cold at night, so be sure to bring warm clothing and sturdy shoes. If you would like to participate, please let me know by the end of today.

KET_7,"Text: 'Experience the Edinburgh Festival! Each year, many people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is filled with performers and artists from around the globe. They gather in Edinburgh for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are vibrant with music and dance from morning until night. You can even watch artists create paintings on the streets. A highlight of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists attend the Festival to watch new films, plays, and listen to music from well-known musicians. This year, there will be over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite stars in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but keep in mind that finding accommodation can be challenging, so consider booking your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen visit every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they fish for the fish swimming beneath the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

To fish, you first break the ice to create a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and lower it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people enjoy eating them, but after I catch three or four, I prefer to have chocolate or another snack! Today, I caught twenty-five! It's a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

Hi Anna,  

I’m having a tough week! Yesterday, my volleyball team played a match, but we lost. The other team was much better than us! Then, my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called with some bad news. He can’t visit us during the holidays because he got a summer job. So, we can’t go camping together now.  

This morning, my sister woke up late and took my bike to school without telling me. I’m really upset with her.  

I hope you have some good news! Please write back today if you can.

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

One well-known tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Visitors can see wax figures of famous individuals here. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures and opened a museum in Paris. Marie assisted him with this work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was imprisoned. While in prison, she had to create wax models of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures are still on display today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. The first bicycle was created around 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were quite costly, making them accessible only to wealthy individuals. These early models looked very different from modern bicycles. Over time, as prices decreased, more people began to purchase bicycles. Many started using them for commuting and leisure activities. 

Today, cars are more commonly used than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some individuals still choose to cycle to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making parking difficult to find."
KET_63,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went directly to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers would give each elephant a new brush filled with paint and take away the old one. Slowly, following their keepers' guidance, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I was amazed by what I saw! One picture depicted a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer do that, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, each varying in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot. Lions are unique among cats because they live in large family groups. These groups often work together to hunt for food. Lions typically inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and track other animals easily. All cats require excellent eyesight to hunt smaller animals for food. Additionally, they need to be fast and strong."
KET_36,"Dear Mrs. Brian,

I regret to inform you that I can no longer attend your class as I must return to my home country. My sister is getting married next month, and I would like to help her shop for a dress. My parents are planning a large meal for the guests, which will require a lot of work in the kitchen.

I am truly sorry to leave the English class. You are an excellent teacher. Please convey my goodbyes to the other students.

Thank you once again.

Best wishes,

KET_33,"Dear Lorna,

I hope you are well. I am excited to share that I started a new job in the city center last month. I work at a Tourist Information Office, and it is quite fascinating. My workday begins at 7:30 AM, which means I have to wake up early! I enjoy this job because I get to meet people from many different countries and share information about our city with them. Attached is a photo of me in my new uniform. What do you think of it?

Best wishes,

KET_20,"THE OSTRICH

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, with adults weighing over 90 kilograms. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are declining. Although ostriches have wings like all birds, they cannot fly. Instead, they use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches are incredibly fast runners, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around three years to grow into adults. They primarily eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson, a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain, began snowboarding at the age of 20. She has achieved success in many competitions. Recently, we interviewed her at a snowboarding event in Switzerland and asked why she chose this sport. She explained, ""I have always enjoyed various sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It’s easy to learn, and you can become quite skilled in just a few months.""

When we inquired about her practice routine, she shared, ""During winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also enjoy running and biking. I truly love all of it! Competing and being in the mountains is wonderful, but free-riding—doing what you want outside of competitions—is the best part for me.""

We also asked her about the key factors for learning to snowboard. She replied, ""You can learn quickly, but taking lessons is essential. Having the right clothing is also important to stay dry, especially since beginners often fall a lot!"""

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to book a room at your hotel for three nights, from September 15th to 17th. I prefer a single room with a shower and a telephone. Could I please have a quiet room on the ground floor? I will be driving to the hotel. Is there a parking area available? I expect to arrive around 10:30 p.m. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? If possible, I would appreciate a meal upon my arrival.  

Thank you for your assistance.

KET_64,"**Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people, ranging from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man, have successfully climbed it. There are several routes to reach the summit, with the Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, considered the easiest. This route typically takes about five days to complete and is very popular among tourists. However, only half of those who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro actually reach the top. This is often due to the unpredictable weather. At the start of the climb, conditions can be hot and rainy, but as climbers ascend, they encounter ice and snow, with temperatures possibly dropping below 20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, climbers should prepare by bringing both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"**Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were so polluted that many fish and insects died, leaving otters without food. However, today the rivers are clean again, and there is plenty of food for them."

KET_59,"**Buildings**

People have always constructed buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry, and we build stadiums to enjoy football matches and concerts. Other buildings, like museums, are used to display beautiful items. Many individuals collaborate on a building project. The architect determines the building's appearance and creates drawings to share their vision. Engineers ensure the building is strong and safe. Finally, workers carefully construct it.

The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a stunning roof. However, it is beautiful from all angles, not just the top. Another notable structure is the Olympic Stadium in Munich, which resembles a glass tent."

KET_32,"The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in southern England that are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large image of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. The exact time when the Cerne Giant was created is unknown, but it is believed to be very ancient. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the image. If you visit on May 1st at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill."
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the top runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she plans to compete in the 10,000 metres and possibly the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in major competitions, but she always remained cheerful, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race, and won with the fastest time of the year for any British woman runner.

Gail's husband and manager, Mike Rollins, used to race as well, but he had to stop competing due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail, but it can be frustrating for him when she runs ahead and he can't keep up. Gail trains diligently, doing long runs in the morning and faster runs in the afternoon, but she always takes Sundays off from running. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' Usually, it's cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. By the age of ten, he wanted to write music and began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian songs. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano skills. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He had his first concert at six years old. By the age of ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. Although he is very busy now, he hopes to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he became a children's book writer at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he works in his office and writes. In the evening, he shares his work with his wife, who tells him what she thinks. ""She lets me know when she doesn't like something,"" Bill explains. His ten grandchildren, who live far away, also read his stories and give their opinions.

Through this feedback, Bill has learned what young children enjoy reading. He often writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, titled ""The Sheepdog,"" which tells the story of a farmer and his helpful dog. ""I have always loved animals,"" Bill says, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" 

Last year, this book was turned into a film featuring real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced computer technology to make it seem like the animals were talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change the stories, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually feature images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many individuals send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the images are often more appealing than personal photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, and it displayed a picture of a seaside town. Over time, postcards began to show images related to current events, such as accidents or visits from important figures. People appreciated these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include pictures."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur because the last one died around 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. The exact reason for their extinction is still unknown. Birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were over 5,000 different types. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was about twenty meters long and primarily ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was smaller but much stronger, with sharp teeth for eating meat and long back legs that allowed it to run quickly."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can potentially harm a person. They are skilled climbers and can run quickly. However, bears have poor eyesight and, like many animals, rely on their sense of smell to find food. 

There are seven species of bears. The largest is the polar bear, which can grow to nearly three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one inhabits the forests of North America, while the other is found in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, not all black bears are actually black; some can be dark brown or reddish-brown. 

The black and white panda bear, native to China, is beloved by many. Unfortunately, the number of pandas in the wild is decreasing because they struggle to find enough food in their forest habitats."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles are found in tropical regions around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They primarily inhabit slow-moving waters but can swim quickly and move fast on land. It is common to see crocodiles in large groups. Their diet includes a variety of prey, such as fish, birds, and small animals, and they can also attack larger animals or even humans. There are over ten different species of crocodiles, all equipped with very sharp teeth. Although they frequently lose teeth, they quickly grow new ones. Typically, crocodiles measure about 3.5 meters in length, although some can be much larger. They have a long lifespan, with the oldest recorded crocodile in a zoo living to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers invented the first powered airplane and successfully flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office launched the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes underwent significant changes. By the 1950s, they became much faster due to the introduction of jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, capable of flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, which allows a journey from London to New York to take only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, making it hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was quite different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people would get cold and wet if it rained. The queen enjoyed attending performances at the Globe Theatre, located by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. The audience would eat, chat with friends, and walk around during the performance, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same location by the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
