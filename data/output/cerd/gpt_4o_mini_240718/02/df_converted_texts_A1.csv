**Garbage and Costs**

In many places, families throw away garbage, and it is often free for them. They pay for garbage collection through local taxes. But this is not fair. A big family with a lot of garbage pays the same as a small family with little garbage. 

When people throw away more garbage, it costs more to collect it. More trucks and workers are needed. If garbage collection is free, people will throw away too much. A good idea is to make families pay for the garbage they throw away. This can help them recycle more and throw away less.

Some towns in America have tried this. They sell stickers that families put on their garbage bags. Only bags with stickers are picked up. In one town, Charlottesville, people paid 80 cents for each sticker. 

At first, it seemed to work. The number of garbage bags went down by 37%. But people found a way to fit more garbage into each bag. They jumped on the bags to make them smaller. This is not a good way to reduce garbage. 

In another study, it was found that charging for garbage did reduce the amount of garbage, but not by much. For example, if the sticker price goes up by 10%, the amount of garbage only goes down by 0.3%. 

People in richer towns throw away more garbage than in poorer towns. They also have less time to recycle. 

So, charging families for garbage is not a bad idea, but it is not a simple solution. The effects of these rules can be complicated."
CPE_19,"**Work and Life**

Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life can change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success is not enough anymore. Many people feel their work is not valued. Even famous people can feel unhappy. 

Loving your job used to be enough, but now you should think about how your job affects you. Does it help you grow as a person? If your job makes you boring or too busy, then money and status will not make you happy. 

Zeldin wants to find ways for work to be more fulfilling. Work should not just be about making money. It should help us live better lives and meet new people. But, changing work will not end unemployment. More educated people want jobs that are interesting and helpful.

Even jobs that used to be good, like doctors and architects, can be stressful. Many workers feel unhappy and do not connect with their jobs. In Britain, only 8 out of 100 workers feel their values match their company’s values.

Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He wants to find better ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on making companies richer, but we also need to think about ourselves as people. 

How many of us feel truly alive at work? Some people feel like they are stuck in their jobs, even if they can leave. For example, many hotel workers are smart and lively but have low pay and long hours. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep. They could be places where people from different countries meet and share experiences.

Hotel workers could use their skills to make hotels better. If hotels listened to their workers' dreams, they could offer more services. But often, they only focus on making money.

Zeldin believes work is about relationships. Many people want to feel free at work. They should be able to create their own jobs and choose their coworkers. This means they need to learn to talk to people from different backgrounds.

Good communication is important, but it is not the same as real conversation. Real conversation helps us understand each other better and creates respect. When we have these conversations, we can change the world, even a little bit."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: How Technology Affects Society**

The word 'broadcasting' comes from farming. It means to spread seeds widely. This idea is about growing things in a big way and getting a good harvest. Broadcasting needs a central place to send out information, like seeds from a bucket.

We need to think about why a new technology that sends words and pictures was set up like this. Television is connected to other ways to communicate, like the telegraph and telephone. But from the start, television was made to send information to many people from one central place. This fit well with how society was changing at that time.

There were some other ideas about how to use television. In the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to make two-way television, like a video phone. They wrote articles in science magazines about how to build television machines. Many people tried to experiment with this. But big companies took over and made rules that pushed these small inventors out. This was a missed chance for television to be a more equal way for people to communicate.

In the early 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places, not at home. In Britain and Germany, many people saw television together in groups. The idea of small, two-way television was not successful. Instead, companies wanted to sell television sets for homes. As people had more money in the 1920s, they wanted their homes to have entertainment. This is now happening all over the world.

There is a link between how society changes and how broadcasting works. As society modernized, power and money became more concentrated. People moved around more, which made them feel more alone compared to earlier times when communities were stable. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with everyone. It also helped create a sense of community in the nation.

Broadcasting became the main way to share information through radio and television. However, there is also a positive side to broadcasting. It can help democracy by giving everyone access to important information. 

Television is changing now, and the word 'broadcasting' might not fit anymore. It may only refer to a specific way of sharing information during a certain time in history."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you still do not feel safe. It is normal to want a home that is good for you. But sometimes, we want too many things. Advertisements make us feel like we need more. They tell us that if we do not have certain things, we are not good enough. 

Next time you walk down the street, try not to look at any ads. They are everywhere: on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. They all tell us to buy more things.

**Caves**

Many scientists study caves. They want to know where caves come from, how water moves in them, and what lives in them. Caves are interesting and make us curious. Many people study caves because they are important in nature. 

However, visiting caves can be hard. This means that many people who study caves are not just scientists but also people who visit caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

A long time ago, people started to study the weather just by watching. Now, we have many tools like satellites and computers to help us understand the weather. These tools give us a lot of information very quickly. 

Sometimes, the words used to talk about the weather are very hard to understand. But our own experiences are still very important. What we see and feel helps scientists make weather forecasts."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

I used to think that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think it is more about music. I worked at a national opera house and learned that music is the most important part. I come from the world of theatre, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, the audience and the actors usually understand each other well.

At music performances, like concerts or operas, many people do not know much about music. Some feel embarrassed about this. Most people admire the musicians' skills. Even a good musician has worked very hard to get better. Watching great musicians is like watching athletes. We know running for a bus is similar, but athletes are much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They do not always understand how hard acting is. They may not be impressed when an actor says a long speech. People often ask actors, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences. Many people enjoy both.

I think music can learn from theatre. I have seen how a different approach can make concerts better. Live music is very emotional and can connect with the audience. However, music performances often have strict rules, like dress codes, which can make the audience feel less important.

Sometimes, music audiences clap between songs, which can interrupt the performance. This is often a way to show appreciation, but it can also disturb the flow of the music.

Many people are working to bring new audiences to concerts and operas. They want to show that ""serious"" music is for everyone. I remember a special event called ""In Search of Angels."" It took place in a cathedral and outside in the town. It was a great musical experience, and many audience members felt they were part of it.

I wish music could be more exciting and different, like the best theatre. Sometimes, using unusual places for performances can create amazing experiences for both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are often brave and willing to try new things.

I know that many plays are still performed in traditional ways, but I believe music performances can change too. I love both theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them like I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
I think sand is not very nice. It can be useful for making things like glass and concrete, but I don’t like it at the beach. Sand gets in my face, my food, and can even hide my keys and coins. When I am wet, sand sticks to me and is hard to wash off. But when I step on a towel or walk on a clean floor, the sand falls off easily. Even days later, I find sand in my shoes and socks. I don’t want sand around me.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. A long time ago, they used simple locks. Now, we have electronic locks that use cards. But many people still like to use a real key. They feel safer with a key in their hand. One company made a new electronic lock, but they also added a real metal key. 

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery because I don’t understand modern art. I like some art, like furry things and bright lights, but I wish I knew more. The important thing is to enjoy the art, not to write about it like in school. This gallery helps visitors understand the art better. They have good labels that explain what the art means. Now, I can understand the art more than before."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Making movies from books is not easy. It often means taking away parts of the story. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. When I wrote a script, I saw that I could remove a lot of words and still tell the same story. This does not mean the words in the book were not important. It is just different for movies and books. In a book, we often repeat things to help the reader remember. In a movie, we can see who is talking without always saying ""he said"" or ""she said."" 

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel like we are in another world. For a little while, we forget about our real lives. But when the movie ends, we come back to reality. Some people think movies are just for fun and not real art. Many older people, like our parents and teachers, did not think movies were important. They liked to be entertained, but they did not see movies as art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios had many buildings. It was hard to find your way around. There were three main doors, but they all looked the same. It was confusing for new people. But most people who worked there knew where to go. Because of their hard work, people could enjoy stories of love and adventure in movies. 

**Film-Makers**

Many people want to make movies. There are many books and classes about how to do it. Some people even win cameras to help them make their films. Robert Rodriguez made a movie called El Mariachi for $7,000 and became famous. He wrote about how he wanted to make a great film before he turned 26. 

In the past, it took longer for people to make movies. They worked in different jobs first, like editing or writing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film. Now, many new film-makers have to do it on their own without help from big studios."
CPE_3,"In the past, there were many council houses on the west side of the city. These houses were small and not very nice. In summer, there was a bad smell from a factory nearby. In the morning, a paperboy often looked unhappy as he walked to deliver papers. I don’t remember much from my early life, but I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses far away. I also remember my mother. She was small and often angry. I didn’t understand why she was angry, so I couldn’t make her feel better.

My mother liked to go to small shops. She was a very lonely person, even in a room full of people. She had strict rules about how to behave. For example, we should not go into our neighbors' gardens or touch their flowers. We had to sit quietly at the dining table and listen to the radio. There were many rules, and I didn’t understand them.

My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn’t say much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They often talked about their problems, like bad legs and cold weather. I felt like I was part of their talks, even when I didn’t want to be.

Growing up in West Earlham was not easy. When I was little, I stayed at home until I was five. I remember playing on the floor while my mother sat in a chair, looking unhappy. After I turned five, I went to school half a mile away. Some kids had mothers who rode bikes, but my mother let other kids take care of me on the way.

I remember summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his life at sea. One time, there was a charity event where a kind woman gave out lemonade. She wanted me to join a group to help others, but my mother said no because she thought they just wanted money.

My mother often talked about how people wanted money. She didn’t like politicians at all. She thought they were dishonest. I might be too hard on her, but she didn’t show much kindness.

Sometimes, my mother took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. We would go on the bus, and I had to wear my best clothes. We looked at paintings together. My mother didn’t mind this, and she even made a joke once about a painting of a Roman soldier. It was a rare moment of fun with her."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd side of the street. It was getting dark, and the air was wet and cool. I knew this street well. I remembered my neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store. I also remembered the Krings and the Pottses, where my first friends, all girls, lived. 

The houses on this street were special to me. I noticed small things, like the little channels in the cement that took rainwater from the roofs to the street. I liked to ride my roller skates and scooter there. As the street went down, the houses looked different. The porches were lower, and the yards were smaller. 

Over the years, things changed. Some wooden parts of the houses were replaced with iron. Some houses became stores, and some stores became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these places that used to be stores.

Rick Gilbert is a furniture designer. He lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. His flat has big doors and brick walls. He did not want his flat to be empty. He wanted to have separate spaces for living and working. He used a big piece of plastic to make a hallway and hide his office. He wanted his kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 

He chose light wood for the floors and mixed modern chairs with old furniture from his parents or markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. He wrote a famous book called *In Patagonia* in 1977. This book changed travel writing. It was exciting and full of imagination. 

Chatwin sometimes changed facts in his stories to make them better. He believed that traveling could help people discover new histories and adventures.

**Swimming**

One summer day, it rained a lot. I ran across my lawn and jumped into the pool. I swam back and forth, watching the raindrops make bubbles in the water. The best part was when the rain got stronger, and I could not hear the birds anymore. 

During this time, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea. I felt tired of swimming in the same place, like a tiger in a cage. 

Many places today have signs and labels. This makes the world feel less real. Walking, cycling, and swimming help us feel free and discover the wild parts of our world. A swimming journey would let me see the mysterious parts of nature."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose. But now, scientists think differently. They say crying is important for social connections, especially between mothers and their children. Many people believe that children cry because they feel helpless.

It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In the past, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel close.

People cry for different reasons. We might cry when we feel sad for someone who is treated unfairly. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to when we hear beautiful music or see a touching speech. We may also cry when we watch a sad movie, and this happens more when we are with other people than when we are alone.

Crying is important in social situations, and scientists are still studying it."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming. It means the Earth is getting warmer. But how much warmer will it get? And how will this change our lives? Many people have some idea about global warming, but they are not sure what will happen because of it.

A warmer Earth will change the weather everywhere. This will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and live. If these resources change, it is a big problem.

In the last 100 years, human actions have made the air warmer by adding gases. These gases are connected to global warming. Scientists say that the Earth has warmed by about 6 degrees Celsius in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly because of pollution.

Scientists use computers to predict what will happen because of global warming. These computers help them understand temperature, pressure, and other weather factors. But these predictions are not always perfect.

Most people agree that the Earth will change faster than before. Predictions say that by the year 2100, the average temperature will go up by 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius. Sea levels will rise by 15 to 95 centimeters. There will also be more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts.

These changes will affect nature and humans. For example, forests and grasslands may move to new places. This will change the plants and animals that live there. It can also affect food, water, and where people live. Some changes may be bad, but some may be good. 

In Australia, for example, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures. Fewer frosts mean better harvests. But many changes will not be good. Less water will be a problem, especially in dry areas. 

In some places, like the Mediterranean, there is less rain now. In southern Portugal, rain is falling more in autumn and winter, and less in spring. 

Another problem is melting ice. This will change the land and water where animals live. The Arctic ice is melting, which can make it easier for ships to travel but also more dangerous.

The biggest problem may be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this. Many people live near the coast, so rising sea levels can cause flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo may be affected. Many people could lose their homes.

Small island countries are at the greatest risk. If sea levels rise too much, these countries could disappear. This would be a big loss for the people and their culture. It would also create many refugees who need new homes."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars

Wanted: a married couple for a trip to Mars. The trip will take 501 days. The couple must be healthy and strong. This is for the first astronauts to go to Mars if Dennis Tito's plan works. The trip will start on 5 January 2018. 

The spacecraft will go to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth. This is important because it saves fuel. The trip must happen in 2018 because the next time Mars and Earth are close is in 2031. 

There is a lot of work to do to make new technology for this mission. If the spacecraft is ready, it might go to Mars. Even if it does not go, the work will help for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Art is important, but sometimes it is hard to understand. People often think of art as just a painting, a statue, or a book. But art is more than that. It is about how we feel and experience these things.

When art is very famous, people forget where it came from and how it affects our lives. This makes it hard to see why art is important. Art becomes separate from our everyday life. 

To understand art better, we need to connect it to our daily experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our lives. 

If we want to understand art, we should look at the simple things around us. We can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants, but to really understand them, we need to learn about soil, air, and sunlight. 

Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When people think of art only in museums, they miss out on the joy in everyday experiences. 

Art is best appreciated when it is connected to our daily lives and activities."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

Lions are big cats that live in groups. They hunt together to catch food. Many people think this is amazing. They see lions working together like a team. But after watching lions for many years, we learned that they are not always like this. 

We started studying lions in 1978. We wanted to know why they hunt together, take care of their babies, and scare other animals with their loud roars. We thought that helping each other would help them survive. But sometimes, if one lion helps too much, it can be bad for that lion. 

We thought we would find answers in two or three years. But lions often do not do much. They can be very lazy. It took us a long time to learn about their behavior. Lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now starting to understand them.

**Pop Music Review**

Bedrock is a band that made a new album called ""New Life."" This album changed rock music in our country. It was different from older music. The new music was lighter and more fun. It had happy sounds and funny lyrics. 

The band wrote songs about everyday things like sunbathing and relaxing on Sundays. Some songs were sad but beautiful, like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" ""New Life"" has 16 great songs, and all of them are good. 

**Extract from an Autobiography**

When I was a child, I loved stories about wise women called 'The Sibyl.' One story was about an old woman who tried to sell books to a king. He did not want to buy them at first, but later he paid a lot of money for three books. This story taught me a lesson about life and selling.

I was often alone as a child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they did not want to play with me. My mother told me to do something fun so they would want to join me. It worked, and I learned a good lesson.

When I had to write a travel book, I looked for places that interested me. I do not like to travel much. I prefer to think about old ruins and history.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you send your book to a publisher, it goes into a big pile of other books. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" Some young people or part-time workers look at these books. They want to find something special.

If they like your book, they will show it to a senior editor. This editor will decide if your book is good and if it can sell. They will also think about how popular you are as an author. Publishers like to meet authors before they decide to publish a book."
CPE_39,"**Advertising Problems**

In the early 1990s, working in advertising was very hard. Many businesses were struggling because of a bad economy. In Britain, in 1991, many people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken away by banks. All businesses were affected, and some lost a lot of money.

People who worked in advertising felt a lot of pressure. They had to help their companies make money, but they had less money to spend on advertising. They were told to do more with less money. At the same time, companies started to understand that they needed to make products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make.

Because of this, advertising became more important. Many companies began to pay more attention to marketing. They wanted to know how to make their advertising better. However, this also made the work harder for advertising people. They had to show that their advertising was worth the money spent.

During this time, many companies wanted better advertising strategies. They wanted creative ideas and good planning. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work for them.

Even though advertising people were still working, they faced the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less money. The bad economy made it hard to spend money on advertising. There were also other changes, like new laws about advertising and changes in what customers wanted.

Now, more than ever, advertising people needed to make sure their advertising worked well. But help for them was not easy to find. Many companies were too busy to talk about their problems. Those who were successful often kept their ideas to themselves. This made it hard for others to learn how to do better advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Kitchen**

When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice. Many people wanted different jobs. Being a chef is hard work. Chefs work long hours, and the job can be stressful. They do not earn a lot of money. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the people were not friendly. I thought being a chef would be better. It seemed serious and honest.

I wanted to cook because I loved food. I remember eating a great meal at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I felt very happy after that meal. I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started to focus on cooking instead of my studies. I read cookbooks, visited markets, and cooked many meals.

**Swimming Lessons**

The swimming teacher was a strong man with tattoos. He taught me how to dive. First, I sat on the edge of the pool and rolled into the water. I practiced this until I got better. The next time, he made me dive from the edge. He was strict and told me to look up and keep my legs straight. 

One week, I tried diving from a high board. It was very high, and I was scared. I took a deep breath and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly. The teacher was not happy, but I felt great. I understood what it means to be ""free as a bird.""

**Travelers**

Some people love to travel. They like to explore new places, even if it is dangerous. They climb high mountains and sail on rough seas. They eat strange food and live in unknown places. Some people think these travelers are strange. They live very differently from us. We like our comfortable homes and safe lives. 

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is a writer who is afraid of the sea. He spends a lot of time sailing. He is not the best sailor, but he enjoys it. He likes to write about his sailing adventures. His small boat has a device that tells him where he is on the sea. 

Raban thinks that using a compass is not good. He believes it makes sailors forget to look at the waves and feel the sea. He thinks the ocean is more than just a place to sail. It has life and stories. Because of this, he pays close attention to the waves while sailing."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer is a time for two great joys: going on holiday and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can see our own lives in the stories of others. Authors use words to describe feelings and situations that we may think we are alone in. They can express our thoughts clearly, helping us understand ourselves better. 

When we read a good book or travel to a new place, we see things differently. At first, we notice everything around us. We pay attention to the colors in the sky, the faces of people, and even feelings we didn’t know we had. 

**Author's Note**

These thoughts about travel were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made some small changes to fit the articles, but I kept most of the original text. I also fixed a few mistakes. 

Traveling by plane has changed how we see the world. Many people can now visit places without needing special skills, just the price of a ticket. I believe that travelers are not blind to what they see. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

The word ""ecotourism"" is often used but not always correctly. It started in the 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour companies realized that many travelers wanted to travel without harming nature. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean many things, from living with remote tribes to a short boat trip. 

The idea was to help people make good choices when they travel. But without clear rules, many travelers feel confused about what ecotourism really means.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again a few years ago, and it helped me remember that time. In Transylvania, I had a great time, staying in friendly homes for weeks. I thought I had nothing to write about because I was enjoying myself. 

When I moved to a new place, I sometimes forgot to write. I worried that my notes were not in the right order. But then I realized that it didn’t matter much, so I let the story flow naturally."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought to be new. Many people think it started in the 1800s and 1900s. But fashion has a long history. Historians say it began with trade in the 1500s and 1600s. As societies grew and changed, more types of clothes were made. This made the meaning of clothes more complicated. Now, it is hard to say what a piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.

**Writer**

Many people think that all writers are famous and make a lot of money. But this is not true for most writers. Some writers have other jobs and write in the evening. They need money to live. Others, like me, do different jobs like teaching and writing articles. I have heard of a job writing for a chocolate factory, but I never got that job. I write my book by working part-time and using credit cards. Sometimes, I get help from friends.

**Sudden Fame**

We started to perform in small places, and many people came to see us. We had to use secret doors to avoid fans. On days we did not work, it was hard to go outside without being followed by fans. In a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched us, and our managers took care of us. I was shy, but I also felt a strange confidence. I felt very different and confused."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future of Music**

Technology is changing our lives. Susan Hallam talks about how it affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music. They could use radios, TVs, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, fewer people are playing live music, and there are fewer jobs for musicians.

More people can listen to music now, and this will continue. Music is important for everyone. There is music at big events, and it helps people in many ways. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be. 

Learning to play instruments is still important. The music industry helps the economy in Britain. Playing music can help people learn other skills. Research shows that making music can help with thinking skills. Group music lessons can help children make friends and focus better in school.

Playing an instrument can also help with good habits. For example, practicing can help with studying, and playing in concerts can teach people to be on time and organized. Because of this, many people will want to learn instruments in the future.

What will music look like in the future? There are two likely changes. First, people will listen to many different types of music. New styles will mix together. Second, technology will help people make and perform music. This means more people can create music without needing a lot of skills. But, it may also mean fewer live performances.

More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities. To prepare for this, music teachers need to change how they teach. They should help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. 

Music teachers will need to inspire and teach students of all ages. They will also need to work well with different groups of people. This is a big change from how things are done now. It is important to show that music education is good quality.

Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is very important, but sometimes people forget this. Everyone in the music world should work together to make sure music is valued."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes, people do not like actors. This can happen when actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of explaining their art, they often use boring phrases or talk about gossip. 

An actor named Paul Scofield said that acting is best when it is done, not when it is talked about. He believed that every time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn new things. After a play, the actor feels empty until the next performance. 

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet, a young man who is becoming an adult. His performance is simple but very good. He shows a mix of anger and humor, making his character both strong and likable. You can see how he uses his body to show his feelings. 

**What is Acting?**

Acting is about showing feelings and actions. It raises questions about what makes a character come alive on stage. 

**A Director's Rehearsal Process**

One director has a special way to help actors prepare. First, they show the script on a screen. The actors listen and think about the words. When it is their turn to speak, they take a breath and remember something that helps them understand their line. They should not plan too much and should trust their feelings.

**The Perfect Theatre**

A good theatre makes you feel important. When you go to see a show, it should feel special. The people working there should care about the performance. The audience should feel close to the actors and be able to see and hear everything well. 

The size of the theatre is important too. It should fit the actors and the audience. Old theatres often do this well because they feel warm and welcoming. 

When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and exciting. If it is not special, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll music in the 1950s was very popular with young people. It was important because it changed the lives of many adults too. This music helped new rock stars to grow. They listened to this exciting music and knew it would be part of their lives.

For Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was from a radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party by Alan Freed. Many young musicians listened to this show. Paul Simon was very interested in the music he heard and wanted to make his own music one day.

**Snow**

I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was very strong and made me fall on the ice. Suddenly, I fell into a hole in the snow. The snow looked safe, but it was not. I was surprised and scared. I climbed out of the hole and thought about what could have happened if the hole was deeper. I sat against a tree that was sticking out of the snow. I realized I had only walked half a mile in one hour. I knew I had to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that help researchers with qualitative research. These books talk a lot about collecting data, but not much about how to analyze it. Analyzing data can be confusing. So, we asked different social scientists to talk about how they analyze their data. We wanted to help people understand this process better. We found that explaining this is not easy. We let our contributors share their work in different ways, like personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting like a character from a TV show. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he did not know much.

Many people like to use the internet and computers for learning. But is this a good way to learn? One father tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had read a book for ten minutes, he might have learned something.

Research shows that learning is better when there is talking with teachers or parents. It is important to use new technology to teach our children, but we still need schools and teachers.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most movies in the world were made in Hollywood. People who lived there did not like this. They thought Hollywood was not good. But in the end, people liked Hollywood because it was successful. Success means making a lot of money from movies.

Hollywood has changed a lot. A long time ago, it was a small village with orange trees. Now, it is a big town, famous like New York, Rome, or Paris. People in Hollywood talk a lot about movies: how much money they make, who is dating who, and who is working on what project. Many successful people want to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. But it is still the main place for anyone in show business.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to keep a real record of what they saw. With new tools, they could make pictures that looked very real and detailed. This surprised other artists. Some said photography was not real art because it used machines. But photographers knew they had a new way to express themselves. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils to show the world around them.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, every children's book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older children. There were many children's books, but most were made with a small budget. This meant some books were not very good, but the best artists always did their best work.

The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place to look for interesting art. Some of these treasures will be shown to the public again, either through new books or exhibitions. There are signs that people are starting to pay more attention to these old illustrations, and soon, we may see classic children's book illustrations again."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing Online**

A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. When you say, ""I am here,"" you are also showing your location to many people. Some of these people may not be good to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have problems.

Many people want to share their lives online. They think it can bring them money or fame. But sometimes, sharing too much can be risky. In the past, some people, called bloggers, shared their lives online. They learned about the good and bad things that can happen.

In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the web. At that time, the web was mostly for scientists and students. Hall wanted to share his story. He wrote a blog every day and many people read it. He wrote about everything, and he did not hold back.

One day, Hall had to stop his blog because he fell in love. His partner said he could not write about their relationship. Hall felt sad because he thought sharing his life made people not trust him.

In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job. One day, someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses. Because of this, she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives.

Armstrong took a break from blogging but later got married and started writing again. Now, she is very popular as a ""mommy blogger,"" and she makes money from her writing. 

The lesson is: the internet lets us say many things, but we should think carefully before we share."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired. In rich and busy countries, many people do not sleep well. In the USA, 40 million people have trouble sleeping. Some books in Britain talk about people who cannot sleep. 

A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. 

One sleep expert did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about 8 hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.

In Europe, a university studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors and how noise at airports disturbs sleep. They also study how tired drivers can be dangerous. 

For their studies, they ask students to help. Students get paid £5 an hour. They change their sleep patterns based on instructions. Some students worry because they wear special equipment on their heads. But the researchers only want to study sleep, not dreams.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Students come in the afternoon when they are usually sleepy. They drive while answering questions. The road looks long and bright. Some students say they will not fall asleep. But one student starts to blink and nod off. He wakes up suddenly, but the car goes off the road. 

Dr. Reyner says drinking coffee can help. Two cups can keep you awake for a while. She suggests energy drinks and gum for more alertness. 

Scientists know that people sleep in cycles. When we sleep, we go through different stages. We dream during light sleep. Our bodies are still, so we do not hurt ourselves. 

Scientists think sleep helps our bodies heal and rest. Women usually sleep longer than men, and older people need less sleep. 

Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. In the past, people slept differently. A history professor found that in Britain from 1500 to 1850, people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, and then went back to sleep. This time was for thinking and remembering dreams. 

By the 17th century, rich people started to sleep less. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours. 

In some places in the world, people still do not have fixed bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. For some tribes, noises and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep all night. 

It seems that many people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wore a cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the mountains and felt out of place. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but then I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He looked very different from me. 

I used to be a racing driver. I loved it. But now I do not race anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other jobs to do after racing. I thought of some ideas, but they did not work out. 

Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. People do not want to hear about my past. They do not want to hear stories that end with ""almost."" Even if I was a champion, people would not want to listen for long. 

I had a good time racing. I made money and had fun. But I miss driving fast cars. I miss the excitement and the people who cared about what I said. Now, I have a lot of free time. 

I looked at the blue sky. There were no big birds flying above me. I saw some small brown birds in a cactus. They seemed to want me to leave. I did not know the desert had songbirds. I realized that I, a fake cowboy in fancy boots, had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people walk in the city streets. If you walk with them, you can hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe place to live, and good schools and jobs. Some people do not like how fast new buildings are being built, but many new people and tourists have helped the city grow. 

**Supermarket Opening**

Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A famous person, like a soap star or a DJ, would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day, and famous people are not needed anymore. Last week, older people waiting in line did not care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first. A customer said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news made the people at the front feel happy, and those who came later felt jealous."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. Many people talked about it, but it did not make a lot of money. Later, it became popular again on television. This film inspired many people to make their own movies. It was the first film by Orson Welles. Welles said he did not know what he could or could not do, so he just made the film his way. He had a great team with him, including cameraman Gregg Toland and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. They decided to tell the story of a newspaper owner who was like William Randolph Hearst. Welles was excited to direct and act in this film.

**Dermot and Carmel**

One morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He told her he might be late and might stop at the golf club. He wanted to talk to someone there. Carmel nodded but seemed to not really hear him. Dermot asked her, ""Will you be okay? What will you do today?"" She smiled and said, ""I have nothing to do, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is a waste of time to do nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You should enjoy your day. If I am late, I won’t be hungry, so don’t worry about food."" Carmel replied, ""That’s fine.""

**Job Titles**

A study showed that job titles can make people unhappy at work. Many employers and workers think titles create problems between colleagues. The study found that 70% of office workers would give up a pay raise for a better job title. People do not want to be called ""subordinate"" anymore. Job titles often sound nice, like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator,"" but they do not really mean much."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. I loved taking pictures. It was my job and my passion. I liked how light looked on different things. A single photo could show a moment in time, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture. I had my camera ready and kept looking for good shots.

Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. It was a great picture, and many newspapers wanted it. I felt lucky. After that, I started working for myself. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as good as I hoped. That is why I was in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photos, and I was getting paid. That was good for me.

I got this job by chance. I had taken pictures in London for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons."" I took photos of London in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I showed flowers in Hyde Park and busy streets in Piccadilly. But I knew that some of my best photos would not be used. It was just a picture book.

After Christmas, I sent my winter photos to the publishers. They told me that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the job in Vienna. They asked me to take his place. They liked my work, and I was free to go. I was happy to leave because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great.

They put me in a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy trip. I did not take many photos then. This time, I was alone in January, and I knew it would be different. When I arrived, I saw the beautiful buildings covered in snow. I was excited to take great pictures.

On my first day, I did not take any photos. I rode the trams around the city, getting on and off to enjoy the sights. The weather was cold, but it was beautiful. I wanted to make my own memories of Vienna, not just copy someone else's.

A photograph is a moment in time. You have to wait for the right moment. So, I looked around and waited. The next morning, I woke up early. It had snowed, and the main square, Stephansplatz, was white and quiet. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral there. It was tall and wide, and I was not sure how to capture it in one photo. But I knew it could still be magical in the snow.

Photography has always felt special. Even when you understand how it works, it still feels like magic. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photo in a dark room. That feeling of mystery never goes away. Maybe that is why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning did not surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art**

There is a new art show at the Hayward Gallery in London. This show is about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. The show looks at this type of art from the last 60 years. It has many paintings, drawings, and films. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied kinetic art for a long time. He wants visitors to enjoy the art without too much text or explanations. This way, people can discover things on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney is a famous artist. Many people like his work. His art is easy to understand because it shows real things. Some people enjoy his art because it helps them escape from daily life. Others like Hockney because he is funny and interesting. Some critics say Hockney is not a great artist. They think he is too popular. But Hockney knows his art is not for everyone. He does not say he is a great artist. He believes that only time will tell how good his art really is.

**Window-Shopping - An Art Exhibition**

In the last few years, I have seen many art shows. Some are very good, and some are not. I do not like shows that try to push a certain idea. Sometimes, these shows help us see new trends. But often, they feel forced. So, I decided to create a different show called ""Window-shopping."" I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. This show had different artworks that were not connected by a theme. 

For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley made a video of him breaking a camera. These artworks are very different, but they can still be shown together. They do not bother each other and can even help each other look better.

**Art History**

Some people love paintings but do not want to think too much about them. They worry that thinking will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus too much on theory and forget the joy of looking at art. This is like knowing how to cook a dish but not enjoying the taste. 

It is important to enjoy art, but knowing more about it can also make it more enjoyable. Our feelings about art are influenced by the society we live in. What we like is not just about our genes or personalities. It is also about the values of our culture. While it is important to feel and enjoy art, thinking about it can also be valuable."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age liked shiny things. One day, a person sitting by a river found a shiny yellow stone. It was not like other stones. This stone was gold. People liked gold because it was soft and easy to shape. They also found copper, maybe by accident. When they saw that copper could make good tools, they wanted to find more copper. This is how people started to work with metals.

**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street to the town. The wind was very strong, and waves hit the shore. There were no people outside, and all the windows were closed. We saw the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The dark clouds made me think that coming to Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I had told my friend we would walk by the beautiful coast and enjoy warm evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived long ago are not here anymore. We cannot ask them about their lives. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot do experiments on them. However, we can use computer modelling. This means we can create pictures of old places and make virtual people who act like real humans. We can set rules and see how these digital people live. We can change things, like the weather or the number of people, and watch what happens."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, a strong male monkey saw a strange male monkey near their trees. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he did, the strong male might lose his place as leader. 

To keep the strange monkey away, the strong male made a plan. When the strange monkey came close, the strong male made a loud alarm call. This call means there is a leopard nearby. The strange monkey got scared and went back to the trees. The strong male did this many times. 

But then, the strong male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the ground. 

**Cats and Their Prey**

In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year! 

But this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in the village. The important question is: can the bird population survive? The answer is yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. So, cats are hunters, but they do not destroy the bird population in Britain.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen. Every morning, the buffaloes wake up and slowly leave their sleeping place. They go to the water. 

At first, they stand and groan, tired from the night. Then, the leader buffalo steps into the water. Once in the water, they relax and forget what they were doing. They stay in the water for a long time, making low sounds. 

Slowly, they swim away from the house. They look tired, but they spend the day eating plants in the reeds.

**Picasso's Painting**

Pablo Picasso painted many things around him. In 1940, he painted fish while staying in a fishing town. The painting shows a fish seller's table with a crab and some fish. 

The fish look alive, but the painting is hard to understand. Picasso used flat shapes and soft colors. It looks calm, like being underwater. But there is a feeling of danger. The fish seem ready to fight the crab. The painting shows both calmness and a hint of violence."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Photography is a way to take pictures of life and activities. It has been around for about 150 years. With photography, we can see many things, like nature, space, and people’s lives. It helps us understand the world better.

Before photography, people made pictures a long time ago. The first pictures were cave paintings from about 35,000 years ago. We do not know exactly why people made these paintings. They might have shown hunting, been for magic, or just for fun. Pictures have always been important in human culture.

When photography was invented in the 1800s, it changed how we see things. People thought photographs showed the truth. The camera works like our eyes and can take a picture of what we see. This made photography very special.

Some people believe that everyone can understand photographs, no matter where they are from. For example, a person in a remote area could understand a picture of the sun and moon. But as the world changed, we started to wonder if everyone really understands photographs the same way.

Photography is often seen as a clear way to show reality. For example, someone can show a picture and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since photography started in 1839, it has changed a lot. At first, it was just a way to keep memories. Now, photographs are also important historical documents. They tell us about the people and society that made them.

Photography can also help bring change in society. For example, during the Italian Renaissance, new ways of seeing things changed art. Today, photography is a big part of our media culture and shows us the real problems in the world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry is fun, but it can be hard. It is important to read a lot and write a lot. This helps your imagination. Some people write poems when they feel safe. Others write when they are sad. Some people write poems at a certain time. Others wait for a good idea. All ways are okay if they help you write.

When you write, listen to your inner voice. Take care of it and let it grow. One day, it will be strong enough to help you write.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, do not use too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used when needed. A memory can help the story move forward, but it should not stop the action.

Dialogue is important. Two people talking can show different sides of a story quickly. This keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story. Every word should count. A short story needs conflict and action, just like a novel.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. You may not know what will happen next, but you keep moving. As you play more, you learn to see the whole game, not just one move. You start to see patterns in the game. 

**Looking at Writing**

People naturally learn to speak, but writing is different. Charles Darwin said that language is a human instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons. If children do not have a language, they make one up. 

Writing systems were created a long time ago in some societies. Most children did not learn to read or write in the past. Even today, some children find it hard to learn. Children are good at listening, but learning to write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn."
CPE_8,"I am starting a book, but I feel unsure about it. I call it a novel, but I am not sure if it is really a novel. I do not have a big story to tell. There is no death or marriage at the end. I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met sometimes, but I do not know much about his life. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write what I know.

To protect people who are still alive, I have changed the names of the people in this story. The man I write about is not famous. He may never be famous. When he dies, he might not be remembered at all. My book may only be interesting for what it is. But maybe his life and character will be important to others, and people will want to know about him after he is gone.

I think my book will help people who want to write about my friend. I do not say that the conversations I wrote are exactly what was said. I did not take notes, but I remember well. I have used my own words, but I believe they show what was really said. I have also added some things that I did not hear, like historians do, to make the story more lively. I want people to enjoy reading my book.

I feel nervous about writing this book because the people I talk about are from a different culture. It is hard to really know people from another country. People are shaped by where they are from, the games they played, the food they ate, and many other things. You can only understand these things if you have lived them. Because of this, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I usually write about my own country, but in short stories, I can be more general. In this book, my characters are seen through my eyes, not how they see themselves."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Poetry recitals are events where people read poems out loud. Many people today feel confused about poetry. There are many types of poetry and different ways to write and share it. Some poets write poems to be read on paper. Other poets like to perform their poems for an audience.

In the last twenty years, poetry readings have become more popular. Small groups in towns hold these events in places like village halls or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read their work to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings with famous poets.

For poets who perform, these events are good. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand. People can enjoy them right away. But for poets who write more complex poems, it can be hard. Many people may not understand their work if they hear it for the first time.

Listening to poetry is different from reading it. Hearing a poet read their work can help people understand it better. It is good if the audience has the text to follow along or knows the poems before the reading.

Popular poetry events can help people enjoy poetry. They can see that poetry is fun and not just for a few special people. Sometimes, these events even include music, like jazz, to make it more enjoyable."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Oral history is when historians use people's stories to learn about the past. But this can be hard. A person's story is not always true. When someone talks to a historian, both people can change how they feel and what they say. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change the story. The historian's background can also affect the story. The person telling the story may not remember everything correctly. Their memories can be mixed with things they saw on TV or how they feel now. Sometimes, they remember the past with good feelings or bad feelings. These feelings can change the truth of the story.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science studies how animals live and behave. There are two main ways to study animals: looking at how their bodies work and looking at how they act as a whole. Some scientists study how animals learn in labs, usually with rats and pigeons. Others study animals in nature to see how they behave without learning. Both ways are important. Understanding how animals behave is different from just knowing how their bodies work. For example, if we want to know how a bird builds a nest, we cannot just look at its nerves. We need to see the whole bird and how it acts.

**The Social Sciences**  
When students start studying social sciences, they have to learn two things at once. They need to learn about the subject and how to study it. This means they must understand the facts and also how to find and organize this information. Social sciences are about people and society, but they are more than just common sense. Each social science looks at different parts of life and uses special methods to study them. These methods and ideas help scientists understand society better.

**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, and beauty. He did not talk about how useful a building is at first. He focused on how it looks. Before classical architecture, people built simple homes. These homes were not very artistic, but they helped create the ideas for later buildings. Even though classical temples look fancy, they are based on simple, one-room homes."
CPE_7,"Lily and her sister Mui kept a secret from Chen. Lily was learning to drive. She drove around the gardens and the railway. One time, she drove over a small bridge and bumped the car. But Chen was happy when he found out. He said, ""You can drive, Lily! Good job!"" 

Mui thought it was strange. Chen should be upset, but he was excited. He made plans with Lily to go for a drive on a Monday morning. They wanted to leave early and come back by noon so they would not lose customers. Lily would practice driving before that. Mui bought a road map, which made Chen happy, but Lily felt sad because she thought Mui did not trust her.

On the day of the drive, they went to the beach. Lily drove very well. Mui sat in the back and watched. They passed the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats. Lily parked the car in a quiet street. She was not sure about the parking signs, so she paid to park safely.

Chen joked about the car, saying no one would want it. Lily got upset and told him to be nicer. Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Man Kee was a small, warm boy. Chen wanted to teach him about numbers and help him own restaurants one day.

Chen looked at the sea and saw a ship. He used a telescope to see it better. He told Man Kee, ""Look at the ship! It is small and old, but it will take us home."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily came over and put her arm around Chen. 

Man Kee loved the telescope and did not want to give it back. When he finally did, the ship was gone. Lily could only see seagulls flying."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars when it is clear. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched me as I pulled up the well bucket. I steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I did not think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket off the wall. I fell into the well. I hit my head. 

At first, I saw strange lights. Later, I thought about how cartoon characters see stars when they hit their heads. I felt confused, scared, and then angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I wanted to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice. I lay still and watched you through my eyelashes. You went to get help. 

I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself out of the well. I could hear loud voices from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows. My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming. My father told Arthur to pull the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows. 

I felt a rush of excitement. Then I saw the drops of water I left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the ground. My clothes were wet, and there was a little pool of water at my feet. I looked back at my father shining a flashlight into the well. I could not believe no one saw the drops. My mother was screaming loudly. I felt scared. 

I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. I thought I would get in trouble. I wished I had thought more about my plan. I decided to come out of hiding. I cried out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I fell down on the ground. I sat up, feeling comforted in my mother’s arms. I said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it to get out. 

I thought I was almost safe until my father came to me. He wanted me to tell my story again. I did, but I hesitated. He looked at me closely. I said the secret passage fell in after me, and it was dangerous. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like he was seeing me for the first time. 

He said, ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" and walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad face. He knew I was lying. He worried about me because I was not honest. This made me feel even worse."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan is a widow. Her children are now grown up. She is leaving her family home. A big van is outside. It says ""Removers of Distinction."" The workers are taking everything from the house. They are wrapping things in newspaper and putting them in boxes. Fred is the main worker. He is very careful with the breakable things. 

Susan is sad to leave her lovely house. It is a big house with four floors and a view of a small harbour. She remembers the years she spent there with her children. When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five years old, asked, ""Mum, how do you get the house home?"" 

Now, Robert is here to help. He is making sure Susan does not forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, is also helping. She is very bossy and wants to take care of the piano because it is special. 

Fred, the worker, says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replies, ""Yes, they do. They are happy while we work, but when they see the empty house, they cry."" Susan understands this feeling. 

The piano is in the best room of the house. They will take it last. Susan remembers when they first brought the piano into the house. It got stuck on the stairs. The workers tried for a long time to get it in. Robert watched, and Francesca cried, ""We can't live without a piano!"" 

Finally, Peter, Susan's late husband, found a way to get the piano inside. They took out a window and used a crane to lift the piano in. The children were very happy. 

Now, Susan thinks about how her children are busy and do not come home much. She feels tired going up the stairs. She worries about the piano. Fred asks if she is okay. She feels a little panicked. 

Robert and Francesca come to watch. Fred says, ""No tears then?"" Susan feels like crying. Moving things makes her feel sad. 

Then, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is careful with it. They take it outside to the van. Robert laughs, and soon everyone is laughing. They are happy it is over. 

As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan only sheds tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**

Anyone can write book reviews on the Internet. This idea started when the Internet became popular. At first, it was hard for many people to publish their thoughts online. But then, Amazon.com, a big online bookstore, made it easy for everyone to write reviews about books.

On Amazon, anyone can say what they think about a book and give it up to five stars. Each book has its own page, and when someone writes a review, it shows up right away. This helps other readers see what people think about the book, not just what the publisher says.

Amazon is very popular, so many people write reviews. But because there are so many reviews, it is hard for Amazon to check all of them. They have some rules. For example, you cannot write just one word or say bad things about the author. If a review breaks the rules, Amazon will try to remove it.

Sometimes, authors write good reviews for their own books without saying who they are. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset about bad reviews for his book. He wrote good reviews for his own book but later told everyone he did it. Amazon took away his fake reviews.

Authors can also write messages about their books on Amazon. They can ask people to read and enjoy their books. Some authors even give their email addresses so readers can talk to them. But Amazon does not always check if the message is really from the author.

Readers can also write reviews about books. When a book called ""We've Got Spirit"" came out, some people were angry about it and wrote bad reviews. Many of these reviews were removed quickly. But Amazon liked that so many people were writing reviews because it was good for business.

Most reviews on Amazon are serious. They help other readers decide if a book is good to buy. A famous writer, George Orwell, once said that writing too many reviews can be hard. But now, many people can share their thoughts about books, and that is a good thing."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people often think that artists must be different from others. We say that art should be unique and surprising. We like to admire artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. But when we see new art today, we sometimes think it is too strange and not real art. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be new and confusing. We forget that today’s art has old ideas and methods too.

In the past, people asked artists to make art for special reasons. Art was part of everyday life. Now, artists work alone, and we can get upset if they try to connect with us.

**A Situation to Think About**

I want to tell you a story and ask a question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text says there are many kinds of pictures. Then, the artist asks someone to make a canvas and write the text on it in simple letters. My question is: Is this a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

In London, there is a gallery where artists show their work. Many artists stick to one style because it sells well. People expect them to keep making the same kind of art. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, try new things and are successful. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. He is painting pictures of the London Underground instead of his usual still lifes. He has made 40 paintings and drawings that show the interesting world below the ground.

**A Story from an Island**

I have come to a quiet island with some books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would come here. I am alone, except for an old woman who comes to clean my house. I feel neither happy nor sad. I think about memories. I said art is not useful, but it can help us feel better. Art lets us see the world in a new way. It helps us understand our feelings and experiences. Artists use their imagination to deal with life, not to escape from it."
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from my school. I had won two prizes at school. My father talked to my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked. I knew my father was thinking about something important. He usually talked a lot, but now he was quiet. ""You can't fool me. You will do what you want now,"" he said. ""I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I replied. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 

He continued, ""I also heard you want to be a barrister."" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I said. ""I didn't know what else to say!""

He said, ""You have the right personality. You can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like to perform."" 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only see it on TV.""

""Anyway,"" he said, ""I think you will not want to join the family business. You will go to Oxford, and after that, I don't think you will like it."" 

I felt trapped by what my family wanted. I wanted to explore other jobs, but I didn't want to upset my father. I was not as scared of him as Maurice was, but I still found him strong.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said quietly. 

""You will not want to join us,"" my father said. ""It's a pity because you have the skills."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said sadly. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice did not like the business. 

""Anyway,"" I said, ""you could use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. I took care of Maurice because he was younger. I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived well. We had a big house, nice schools, and good clothes. My father knew many important people, and our house was always busy with interesting talks.

""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford,"" my father said. ""Then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some money and help me."" 

""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making a big decision now. This was how my father controlled us. 

So, I helped during my last term at school and during university breaks. I became a smart student with my own small house, a nice car, and good clothes. 

In my last term, my father came to see me. He took me to a village for a meal. My teacher said I would get a First Class degree in Law. I felt ready and confident.

Then my father told me he needed me to do one last important job for the family business. ""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on that. It's very important!"" 

I could see my father did not understand. He would think I was being unkind if I said no. As he talked about the job, I saw how focused and strong he was. He was very good at his work, and I admired him. 

In that moment, my own plans felt less important. ""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello bought a house in Pembroke Square with his wife, Lois. After a year, he thought it was a mistake. They needed to save money, but at first, buying the house seemed like a good idea. Simon had many successful cases at work, and Lois returned to her job after having twins. She earned a good salary, and she wanted to move to a bigger place because their flat was too small for their family.

Lois wanted to live in a nice area, not in a less popular part of London. She thought it was important for them to have a good address. To save money, Lois decided that Simon should take public transport to work. His journey was long and crowded, and he often felt unhappy during this time. He remembered his grandfather's house, where he felt safe and cared for as a child.

Lois wanted her career to be as important as Simon's. They needed both of their salaries to pay for the house and their lifestyle. But now, Simon was worried about a colleague named Venetia. She was upset and angry when she came to their office. Venetia accused Simon of wrongdoing in a past case. She said that a man he defended had bribed jurors, and she wanted to know if it was true. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty and scared.

He wished he had said something different to Venetia. He felt her anger and disbelief. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. He was afraid that if people heard these rumors, it could ruin his career."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be alone. I thought people would not care about the broken houses and messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops see me and start to know me. The flowers from next door remind me that gardens can be beautiful. I usually stay inside, but tonight I am watching the birds fly. I cut some plants to make space for a chair. My hands have scratches from the plants. 

I have a small garden in London. It is hard for plants to grow here. My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window. She is a writer. I sometimes help her with her writing. She asks me how her work is going. Jaz says she wishes she could have holidays like me. She comes down to my garden. I do not want her here because my garden looks messy. 

Jaz sits in my chair and asks about my plans for the holidays. I feel worried about having nothing to do. I tell her I am going to visit my friend Ruby. I ask Jaz to feed my cats while I am away. She agrees. I say I will stay with Ruby, but I am not sure if I will. 

Jaz asks about her story, which I have not read much. I tell her I like the title. I think it is sad that red vans bring gifts to other people but not to her. I give Jaz some advice. I tell her to write about nice people. She gets upset and tells me to get a life. I say I have a life. I work and sometimes go out. 

When we go inside, I feel calm in my kitchen. Then I remember my old teacher, Miss Tarrantine. She used to say, ""I've had my moments."" We all laughed."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage means the things we get from our past. It helps us feel connected to our history. We often know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about our past helps us understand our future. Heritage is important because it gives us a sense of belonging. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit our culture from our families. Some parts of our culture may not be good, but they are still a part of us. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our happiness. It includes our customs and the things we make. 

In the past, we learned about our history through stories from our ancestors. But now, many of these stories are lost. We can find clues about our past in old buildings and places. It is very important to take care of these places to remember our ancestors.

**The Fens**

I wrote a book called *Waterland*. In this book, I wrote about a place in England called the Fens. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and quiet. But when I learned more, I found out that the Fens are interesting and different. Many people in England think the Fens are strange, even though they are part of England. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild. 

I have not visited some places in the Fens, but I like to imagine what they are like. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, they just put things in glass cases with long labels. Now, museums should be more interesting. They can use fun displays to catch people's attention. Museums should also help many different people. For example, they can give boxes of objects to teachers or help elderly people who forget things.

Museums show real items from history. This is their strength. They are different from theme parks or books. Museums that make their displays exciting will attract more visitors who want to see real history.

**Architecture and Environment**

Wanting to keep things safe is not new. But now, changes in our towns happen very fast. This makes some people want to protect old things. People who lived through big events, like wars, often want to keep things stable. If we need to preserve our history, planners should think about this. Change can be good if we learn to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask people on the street to name a scientist, many will say Albert Einstein. His picture is used to sell things like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did. They know he made theories called ""relativity."" These theories are famous but hard to understand. Einstein helped change how we think about science in the 20th century. Scientists wanted to understand the universe better by looking at how things like matter and nature work together. Einstein looked at basic ideas like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, Isaac Newton said that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein said that time and space are not fixed; they can change.

**Young Readers**

When we were kids, my sister Lydia and I did not like books that won prizes. We thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this and would say so. But our father would give us money for each chapter we read to make us read better books. He also gave us some special books for Christmas and birthdays, saying, ""This Book is NOT Literature."" We thought many of his books were for boys, but he did help us read some good stories and poems.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the start of human language is a secret and amazing thing. Many people have strange ideas about how language began. Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans made sounds when they were in danger, and some words today still show this, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" and ""mors"" in Latin meaning ""death."" Many people thought these ideas were silly, but now, studying how language started is important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech to be friendly and to help in fights. Sharing information was not the main reason for language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Most reviews are short and do not last long. They have deadlines and must be a certain length. When they are published, they are only in the newspaper for a short time, like a day or a week.

People think that writing reviews is not very important. Many writers do it because they need money or because they cannot spend all their time on a big book. But writing reviews is a skill. It is different to write a short review of 600 or 800 words than to write a longer one of 6,000 or 8,000 words. 

A reviewer must think about who will read the review. Some readers just want a quick look, while others want to read a serious article. A good reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that is easy to understand.

Many reviewers also write other things. For example, the American writer John Updike writes novels and also writes reviews. He collects his reviews in books, even if they are short.

Some people think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews are not very important. But if they believe their best writing is in reviews, they should be proud of it. 

I have mostly worked in schools and written academic books. In English-speaking countries, it is common for the same people to write reviews and study literature. 

In the past, some academics did not like professors who wrote reviews. But now, it is more accepted. There are many reviews today, so many people can write them. 

I think this is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them remember to write clearly for everyone, not just for other professors. 

In the end, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a side job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,"Ralph opened the door to his flat. It was dark and quiet. He felt a little happy to be home. Even after three years, he sometimes felt this way when he came back alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he was always excited to come home. He wondered what the flat had been doing while he was away. The flat felt like a safe place for him.

He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat was always waiting for him. It looked either clean or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as part of himself. He wanted to change it, but it stayed the same. Sometimes, letters piled up by the door, and the answering machine blinked when he got home. He was glad nothing was broken or damaged.

Ralph worked in a small office and looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After a long day at work, he wanted to be alone. But when he got home, he often felt lonely. He wanted to feel like himself again, but he felt empty instead. He thought that his job was changing him and making him feel lost. 

At night, he would read or listen to music, but he started to wonder why he did these things. He felt confused and lost. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and more sure of himself. After university, he wanted to improve his life, but he just wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, but he didn’t think he could find a job that would make him happy.

He went to one job interview and was happy to talk with Neil, his future boss. Neil offered him the job right away. Ralph was surprised to learn he was the only graduate who applied. He took this as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I went to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, ice-cream vans, and food stalls. The music was loud. Everyone was going to the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good place to watch. 

They made a special area for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They tried to keep the goats in order. This was not easy because goats like to eat everything!

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I felt scared about the night. The canoe was wet, and we could not sleep in it. There were no places to stop, and we had not seen any villages since morning. In the dark, we used a flashlight to see the cliffs. But the flashlight batteries were low, and when we changed them, they did not work. 

We could not find a place to camp. After a while, Lesley saw a light far away, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the water. Soon, we heard loud water, but we could not see it. We kept moving on.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but I have to do it for my job. I want to be better and feel more confident. 

You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company. Many people in charge need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you say. Show your passion and enthusiasm. 

You need to prepare well. Think about what you want to say and ask your colleagues what questions the audience might have. Start with something everyone can relate to, and then lead to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities take time. You cannot hurry them. If you are late for a meeting, you can rush. But if you are too quick with mayonnaise, it will not be good. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get worse. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very fast, but others take a long time. 

We can get better at some things, like solving puzzles. But some things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they will not work well. For example, you cannot sleep well in a short time. 

We learn and think in different ways. Some ways are fast, and some are slow. There are three speeds of thinking. The first speed is very fast. Sometimes, we need to react quickly. For example, if you fall off a bike, your body knows what to do before you think about it. 

The second speed is thinking. This is when we solve problems and make decisions. A mechanic fixing a car or a student doing homework uses this kind of thinking. We call this 'intellect'. 

The third speed is slow. This is when we think in a relaxed way. We can think about things while we are resting or daydreaming. This slow thinking is also important. It helps us understand complicated problems. 

Sometimes, we need to take our time to think. If we are not sure about something, like where to go on holiday or how to manage a group of people, it is better to sit and think slowly. This kind of thinking is connected to creativity and wisdom. 

Scientists are now studying how our minds work slowly. They find that this slow thinking can help us understand things better. It can solve problems that are too hard for fast thinking."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed nicely. It is a friendly place with many people. There are about forty people here, like scientists and students. We all help each other. My French is okay for talking, but I cannot have fun conversations. I miss some words, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt shy. I was nervous at mealtimes. I did not know which table to sit at, and I felt scared when I spoke. I still smile a lot or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think I feel a little sad because I am not as confident as I was before.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was a young writer. He did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he would not see me. But then I became a successful playwright, and Elliot started to be nicer to me. One day, he invited me to lunch. I thought he wanted to get to know me better. After my success, I saw him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film director. He said he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and the music. He believed that good films make people feel strong emotions, no matter where they are from. If a film is made well, people in Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock was very smart and knew a lot about making films. He wanted to make people scream with excitement. He focused on the film itself and how it can affect the audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. Thirty years ago, there were not many charts and books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good. Now, we have many types of telescopes and equipment. Computers help us make charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 

But, some things are not as good. Now, you may need to travel 80 km to find a dark sky. In the past, it was easier to see stars in cities. During the day, we see many airplane trails in the sky. These trails can last a long time and make it hard to see the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, we have too many choices. There are many things to do and many products to buy. People want the newest things all the time. Technology makes this faster. New products come out all the time, and it can be overwhelming. 

Having too many choices can make us stressed and tired. We want to find simple things that make us happy in a complicated world. But it is hard to simplify our lives when there are so many options. There are many brands of soap and cereal, and it is hard to keep track of everything.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family goes to McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a tradition from my grandmother. It is very important to us. We do not want anything to change this tradition. 

The people who stay at McAndrews Hotel are special. Some may think we are old-fashioned. I do not like the rude behavior of some shop workers today. I prefer polite service. I know many guests at the hotel because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them, we only say hello. We respect each other's privacy, which is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
There is a play called Othello by Shakespeare. It is now in London. I wrote a bad review of it last spring. I said the actor Ray Fearon was too young for the role of Othello. I was wrong about his acting. He did a great job. The whole cast is great too. There are many memorable scenes. One scene is when Cassio plays games with other young officers, and it gets out of control. Another scene is when Iago starts to lose control. There is also a very sad scene when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The play is exciting and full of tension. You should see it!

**Lake Vostok**  
In Antarctica, there is a place called Lake Vostok. It is under 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been there for 25 million years without air or sunlight. Scientists want to explore this lake to find out what lives in it. They are very excited to learn about the secrets of Lake Vostok. 

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn about everything. They think it is important to know if what they do is right. Science is a tool, and we should decide how to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Food is very important to us. Many people who like to cook buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special days or fancy meals. But that is not true! You can make a tasty soup by putting chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and some herbs in water. This soup is better than buying a packet or a tin. You can also make a yummy dessert in five minutes that both kids and adults will enjoy. Cooking is a way to show care and love. Sharing food is special. We celebrate important days like birthdays and anniversaries with food. No one wants to eat takeout at a wedding!

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but it was still messy. Papers were everywhere. He had many tax forms and other papers to organize. He knew Mallory would come on time for their meeting. She was always on time and liked things neat. He worried about what she would think of his messy office. His cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, came while he was trying to clean. He smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked unhappy and went into her own space, leaving Alistair to deal with his mess.

**Karen**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She made her own story about strength. One important moment was when she was twelve years old. Her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the doctor said she was okay. She only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, she felt grateful and knew she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly on the village green. She felt both happy and sad. She was excited to know something important in her small town, but she was also sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years and always cared for her. She remembered how he helped her with her throat problems. Dr. Bailey made her feel like he had time to listen to her worries. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to others. Because of this, people were very loyal and cared for him."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. She also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. 

At one concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised her. She thought it was funny. She played it, and the boy was happy. 

Joanna cares a lot about how children learn music. She has written a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" for beginners. She is very busy with concerts and other projects, but she thinks teaching kids is important. 

Joanna believes that everyone should be able to learn the piano, just like swimming or speaking a little French. Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time. Some kids stop learning because they feel too much pressure from their parents. 

Joanna wants music to be fun. She thinks it is important for kids to enjoy playing. Her books have stories and music to make learning exciting. She wants children to play freely and try new things on the piano. 

She knows that practice is very important. Joanna practiced a lot when she was younger. Now, she loves to practice every day. She understands that some kids find it hard to practice, and she wants to help them. 

Joanna believes that learning music should be enjoyable, no matter how long you practice."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson said that if writing is easy, people do not enjoy reading it. Good writing takes time and effort. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not make many mistakes. Now, I would change them many times. Writing by hand was hard, so I wrote carefully. When we use computers, it is easy to make mistakes. Many writers spend a lot of time fixing their work on the computer, just like they would with handwritten text. 

Emails are different from handwritten letters. Many people now write love letters by email. This is good because at least they are writing. But words on a screen can be boring. People often do not think carefully about what they write. They can make their words too strong or unclear. Writing quickly on a computer can lose the care that handwriting has.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. Mr. Warriston came back and said, ""These are wonderful, aren't they?"" I agreed and gave him the disc. He said, ""It is amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on one."" He turned on the music player, and lights came on. He opened a little drawer, put the disc inside, and closed it again. 

""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. He looked surprised and said, ""No, you only play one side."" I asked why, and he thought for a moment. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""You could make both sides work."" He smiled and said, ""Good point."" Then he told me to sit in the best place to hear the music. I was happy to ask a question he could not answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were made after cigarette lighters, we would think they were better. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the printing press. But big changes take a long time. Some people think that reading on a screen is better, but many do not like it. Reading long things on a screen is hard, so people usually read short parts. 

Some people say that reading on a computer is new and exciting. But many books have always been read in different ways. What is new is that computers do not help people read everything from start to finish.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw it was very neat. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood. Everything was in its place. Kathleen was trying to close a filing cabinet. She said, ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, looking at the room. He did not want to think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She did not understand why he did not want to use technology. He was good with computers and had even written an important paper about them. She could use software to make new things easily."
CPE_32,"Lancelot's secretary shouted, ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" She was not really asking; she knew he did not take sugar because she had made him coffee for many months. She forgot some things because Lancelot was not usually at work. But now, he was there all the time. He thought about how he went from a helpful person to someone who was always busy and had no place to park when he got to work.

His secretary waved a folder and said, ""This is from that man in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The folder had a label that said, ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one. Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. 

Lancelot remembered that Ian was a friend who was hard to work with. He read the synopsis quickly and recognized many phrases. He closed the folder and put it aside. It seemed like Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis was not very good, and it felt like Ian had lost his ideas. 

Lancelot thought about a famous author who had published an incomplete book after he died. But that author had not received any money before. Ian had received a lot of money, which was not how things should work. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a talented writer. He had many ideas but never shared them. While other writers became successful, Ian stayed quiet. 

Ian was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. He had a contract with a fashion magazine, but he did not produce anything. At meetings, he was mean to others' ideas. Now, Lancelot thought that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Change**

A good breakfast is very important, say health experts. But in the past, breakfast was not common in England. In old stories, people did not often talk about breakfast. Some travelers ate a meal early in the morning before long trips. Sick people sometimes had breakfast to feel better. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or rich people.

In the sixteenth century, things started to change. More people began to eat breakfast. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. But there were also other big changes in society. For example, many people started working set hours. This meant they had to start work very early. So, eating breakfast became necessary for everyone, not just for rich people."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, ideas, and experiences. It also depends on the culture and society around them. In this book, we will learn how these things change the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also see how people look at and feel about these pictures. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they understand the photos in it. But we can ask if the photo shows the truth of what happened. Does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the moment in the photo very important, or does it mean something bigger about the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you must focus only on your goal. Sports can be tough, and you must work hard. It teaches you discipline and how to work with a team. My sport helps me do well alone, but it is also a team sport. This is like life; you can do well by yourself, but you must remember others are with you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened new opportunities for me and let me see many places in the world. But you also have to give up some things to get these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some memories are very clear and special. For me, one special memory is from a night in California. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing in a tree. I was not awake because I could not sleep; I was awake because the bird sang beautifully. As I listened, I felt like I was in a special musical world. The bird's songs reminded me of jazz and Indian music. It felt like a wonderful performance. I enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

People have always talked a lot about birds. Birds are important in our culture. Paul Evans writes about this. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird is bumping against the glass. This bird is a wren. Some people think wrens are special and have messages for us. Others think it is just a bird that is lost. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, we still see pictures of wrens in many homes. Even if old beliefs are not strong now, people still like wrens. A place without wrens feels sad. 

People used to depend on nature for survival. They learned to understand the meaning of different animals. This understanding can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once loved in London. People saw it as a helpful bird. But later, people thought it was a pest and many were killed. Now, red kites are protected again and are coming back. 

Our connection with birds is very old. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. Birds are important to us because they represent freedom and beauty. Some people think our feelings about birds are not important now, but they are still part of us. 

Today, birds help us understand changes in the environment. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means we are losing not just birds, but also part of our culture. Birds like the skylark and turtle dove have special meanings in stories and poems. Losing these birds makes us feel bad. 

Folklore, or traditional stories, is very important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that science cannot. They help us feel emotions that are hard to express. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, we feel excited. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with the past and the future. It makes us think and wonder."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map shows where things are on the earth. It helps us understand distance and direction. Long ago, people talked about distance in time, like ""it takes many hours to walk"" or ""a day's trip by river."" This helped people know how easy it was to travel, not just how far it was.

Direction is also important, but for many travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, maps were not always very accurate about direction. For a long time, people used written directions instead of maps. Some maps, like train maps, still do not show true directions.

In the past, important places were marked with signs. The size of the signs showed how important the place was. Different maps used different signs, so it is important to understand what each map means.

Over time, maps became more accurate. People learned to use tools like the compass to find direction. They also learned more about the world through exploration. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect ball, which helped make better maps.

More people started using maps, not just travelers. Soldiers needed accurate maps for battles. This led to new ways to show land features. Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work.

Today, map makers create maps for many things, like weather and land use. Maps are very important in many sciences. The study of maps has changed a lot over time. There have been times when map-making did not improve, but there were also times of great progress.

Many maps we have today are the result of a lot of work and thinking. They are important for understanding our history. This is why studying old maps is interesting and helpful."
CPE_35,"**Tim Rice**

I went to see a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber. His room was very nice and full of records. He had a stereo record player and beautiful wine glasses. Andrew was a teenager who wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I also wanted to be famous, like a pop star. 

Andrew asked me to help him write songs. He played me some of his music, and it was really good. I was excited to work with him. I had written a song before, but it was not very popular. We promised to meet again and write music together. 

The next day, I went back to my job as a lawyer. I thought about Andrew and our plans. I still wanted to be a pop star, but I also wanted to see Andrew again. He was interesting and liked football. 

Andrew had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who helped orphans. I thought the story was not very exciting, but Andrew believed in his music. I decided to help him write funny songs for the musical. I even skipped work to write lyrics. That day, I didn’t know it, but I was starting a new career."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I can talk to each other. This is a special skill. We use language every day. When people are together, they talk. If no one is there, people talk to themselves, their dogs, or even their plants. I think talking is like an instinct. Just like spiders know how to make webs, people know how to talk.

**Climate and Weather**  
The air around us makes climate and weather. They are very important for animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places have tropical jungles with many kinds of plants and animals. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day because of moving air. The sun also helps to move the air.

**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, I served drinks and made coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant needs good coffee to be successful. I had many days of training to learn how to make coffee. I learned how to clean the coffee machine and make a good cappuccino. At first, it was hard to make coffee. I thought I would have to do easy jobs again. But my boss was kind. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science. You need time to learn."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why is it hard to find good TV shows about art? Painting and sculpture are great for TV because the camera can show the whole artwork and also show the details. But there are not many shows that show the joy and details of looking at art. 

One example is Robert Hughes's show called ""American Visions."" He is a trusted critic and has a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British people about American art. I thought the show would show famous artworks. Instead, it talked about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked with metals and became known as a speculator. The metal market is not controlled as much as other markets. With some luck and a good understanding, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this job. 

But now, the experts who said the market would keep metal prices high are wrong. More metals are being taken from the ground, and prices are going down. If we think about inflation, most metal prices are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I looked into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap metals.

**A Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands in the Bahamas. They go from Florida to Cuba. Each island is different and has something special. To get around the islands, you need a boat. If your room does not come with a boat, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go by yourself. 

Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called ""The Sailing Capital of the World"" because the waters are calm and safe. It is also a great place for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"Text: 'Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK

You can make your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club. This club is run by two engineers, James Marr and Ian McMillan. They offer a fun weekend where you can build a bike with a special frame made just for you.

It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bikes from bamboo. I went to see how it works. There is a lot of energy and fun in the workshop.

Bamboo is a new and interesting material for making bikes. Some companies in California and Yorkshire have made bamboo bikes since 1894. But these bikes can be very expensive. A ready-made bamboo bike frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868. 

James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes that everyone can afford. They worked hard in a shed in Wales to create a bike that is not too expensive. They wanted to share the joy of making something special and good for the environment.

Now, the Bamboo Bike Club is a community project. James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame and have fun.

On the first day, James and Ian teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You will glue the bamboo tubes together to make the bike frame. They help you with every step and check your work. If you make a mistake, it is okay! You can try again with another piece of bamboo.

On Sunday, you will wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After that, you can add wheels, brakes, and other parts to finish your bike. The bamboo bike is strong and can last a long time. 

James and Ian say their bikes are very good. James has used his bike for three months, and it is still strong. The bamboo bike may look a little different from metal bikes, but it is unique. 

I tried riding James's bike, and it was light and smooth. It was fun to ride! The price for making your own bamboo bike is less than £500.'"
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend worked as an editor at Random House in New York. One day, she saw a book by Dr. John Gray, a new pop psychologist. She thought the book would be very popular, and she was right. Now, Dr. Gray is very rich, and Dione has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps men and women talk to each other better. This book is part of a big self-help industry in America. Many people want to improve their lives, and this industry helps them. 

In Britain, people see that many self-help books are not very good, but many are published. For every self-help book, many others are not published because they are too similar or too specific. Editors look for the next big book. They care more about how to sell the book than how it is written. Dione says that a catchy title is very important. If the title is good, many people will want to read it.

**Autobiographies**

When someone writes an autobiography, they should tell the truth. But this does not always happen. Sometimes, the writer feels ashamed or thinks some things are not important. Sometimes, the writer may change the truth to make a better story. They might call it an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. 

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Dashiell Hammett wrote detective stories. These stories show problems in society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In these stories, a crime shows human feelings like greed or desire. Solving the crime helps society return to normal. But in Hammett's stories, society is not perfect. The detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is a little bit of both: he is a good person and a bad person. 

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. He believes that only scientists can write well about science. If you do not know the science world, it is hard to write about it. Gould says that writers should not talk down to readers. They can use simple words, but they must keep the main ideas clear. If readers feel like they are being treated like children, they will not enjoy the writing."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, it is cold inside. Many workers from the City of London come here for lunch. This summer is very hot, so the gym uses a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic! Many places use air-conditioning too much. They can use other ways to stay cool. For example, they can use sunlight and fresh air. They can also have thicker walls to keep the heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas can help and reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
Now, many people are interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A long time ago, they were very important for telling time. But when clocks became better, sundials were just for decoration in gardens. Now, people like them again. David Harber makes sundials. He thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. When he gives one to someone, it feels magical when it starts to work. Sundials are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
I remember seeing china-painting at an art show. Older women painted flowers on teacups very well. They were very good at it! I thought it would be hard to learn. I wondered if new students would be good at painting too. But when I went to a class, it was fun! Everyone was there to enjoy themselves. The teacher did not want to paint like the women I saw before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, Italy, at a hotel called Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk said they would be with a school group from the south coast. This group was learning Italian.

But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called Edelweiss in Switzerland, not Venice. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard older people speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there was a mistake.

When they arrived, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. They did not expect to stop overnight, but when they got off the coach, it was almost midnight. They were tired and did not ask about their beds. The next morning, they learned they would stay in the hotel for their whole holiday. This made them worried.

Keith told the receptionist, ""We were meant to be in Venice."" The receptionist did not know about Venice. Dawne said the travel agent was a bald man with glasses. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who was with the older people, came over. She smiled and said she was in charge.

Dawne explained they were in the wrong hotel. Keith said they followed the girl at Gatwick and thought they were in the right group. Dawne added that the older people were not from Dover, but from Darlington. 

Mrs. Franks explained that there are many different holidays with the same yellow-and-red labels. She laughed and said they could end up anywhere if they just followed others. Keith insisted they were not supposed to be in Switzerland.

Mrs. Franks then walked away. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. Dawne said Mrs. Franks seemed nice, but Keith was thinking about everything that happened. 

An old man named Mr. Nottage spoke to them. He and his wife said they had a great sleep because of the fresh air. Dawne said that was nice. Keith and Dawne left the hotel and did not talk about how funny it was that they ended up on a holiday with older people. They wanted a break from older people, but now they were with them. Uncle had said they should take a holiday together."
CPE_48,"**He Was a People Person**

Many people in Britain know about Sir Ernest Shackleton. He was an explorer in Antarctica. Recently, people in America are learning about him too. They are very excited. There are new books and a big exhibition about Shackleton. A film about his life is also being made.

Some American managers look up to Shackleton as a good leader. They talk about his adventures and what they can learn from him. Shackleton was strong and smart. He had a special sleeping bag and a stove made from animal fat. He is now a model for people who help companies.

Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, thinks Shackleton is a great example. He helps companies talk about problems, like when a factory has an accident or when workers lose their jobs. MacGregor says that Shackleton was a good leader because he cared about his team. He made hard choices, like when he turned back from the South Pole to keep his men safe.

In 1914, Shackleton's ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months. When the ship sank, he told his men to trust him and do their best. He always kept them informed and listened to their ideas. Shackleton was flexible and ready to change plans if needed.

MacGregor believes that Shackleton showed that a leader needs to be hopeful and patient. He also led by example. Once, he gave his gloves to a team member who was cold. He even saved a biscuit when they were very hungry because it was very important to him.

Caroline Alexander, who wrote a book about Shackleton, says that people today want to hear stories of brave actions. Shackleton is a true hero, and his story inspires many people."
CAE_15,"**Aye-Aye: A Special Animal in Madagascar**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is a primate, which means it is related to monkeys. It has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. 

Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its big teeth to chew into the wood and its long finger to reach inside and get the insects.

Scientists have studied the aye-aye to learn how it finds food. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied three aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, and Samantha, who has a baby named Annabelle. He wanted to see how they find insects in the wood.

Dr. Erickson made small holes in logs. Some holes had food inside, and some did not. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food. They did not need to see the holes to find the food. They might have used their sense of smell or sound, but tests showed they did not need these senses either.

Dr. Erickson found that the aye-ayes can feel the empty spaces in the wood. When they look for food, they tap the wood with their long finger and listen carefully. They can hear if there is a hollow space inside. This helps them find the insects.

The aye-aye is special because it can do things like a woodpecker and a bat. It also acts like a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing, just like a squirrel's teeth. In the wild, it has been seen chewing nuts and getting the food inside.

The aye-aye is a unique animal that helps keep the forest healthy by finding food in a special way."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have pictures of our grandparents. But how many of us know what their lives were like? We may have some stories, but they are often not complete. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We want to write things down, but we often do not do it. 

Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. She writes about ordinary people, not famous ones. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family. She saw that many stories from the past were disappearing. 

""When I started, I did not take it seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have interesting lives. They want to do this for their children and for the future. But they also enjoy it."" 

People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I talked about my divorce and the pain I felt."" He wrote for his family but did not want them to read it yet. He thought it was better for them to read it after he was gone. 

Hannah noticed that many people are affected by their childhood. ""Many people repeat the same mistakes,"" she says. ""They marry people their parents liked or choose the opposite to rebel."" 

Many people still feel sad about things that happened with their parents. They try to impress their parents, even if their parents do not care. 

Hannah listens to people without judging them. ""I am not here to be nosy,"" she says. People sometimes share things and then worry if they should be in the book. But most people want to be honest. 

Hannah's books are not for everyone. They are not just for people who want to show off their lives. She believes we are losing touch with our past. Her books help people connect with their family history. 

Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story. She can make the book look nice, and people can choose the color and title. 

Hannah's books are special and cost about £3,000. Many people ask her about the books, but the price stops some from buying. ""I thought more people would want them,"" she says. ""But the people I have worked with are often wealthy and want to leave something for their family."""

You can have fun making wall hangings by rubbing over 100 different brass plates from tombs of knights and ladies. The centre makes copies to protect the originals. Many beautiful brass plates were destroyed in history, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and you can see many at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Being a Father**

A. **The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange life, but I love being a father. I have spent 35 years with my children, and I enjoy every moment. This morning, I fed my baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I am very lucky with my children. We all like the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This makes us close, especially now that they are older and we are friends. I do not believe in hitting children. I have done it when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I always try to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. I do not want to make them feel guilty for not calling.

B. **The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, about 25 years old. I found it hard to have so many responsibilities. It made me feel older, but it also kept me young. When they became teenagers, they showed me new things like music and fashion. This helped me in my job. I missed some important moments when they were young, like their first concerts, and I feel sad about that. But now, I can take them on holidays, and they enjoy being with my friends at parties and events.

C. **The Politician**  
My first child was born when I was starting my political career. I promised my wife that we would spend time with our children, but it has been hard because I am very busy. I only go to meetings on weekends if my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do, and they do not feel like I am gone all the time. I see more politicians bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want our children to be part of our lives.

D. **The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I had to think a lot about being a father. I tried hard to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily. But I think it was confusing for them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated them like adults too soon. Kate said we were too relaxed. I wish I had more rules. I still worry about my daughters, no matter how old they are.

E. **The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home. We thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand myself better. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but when I see her smile, all my worries go away. A baby's smile can make anyone feel better."

CAE_46,"**Science and Weightlessness**

Tom Mumford is a journalist. He joined students who were flying to test their ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. It was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights. Most seats were gone, and only a few students sat at the back. They were nervous but excited.

For a year, these 13 students from Europe and America worked hard to be on this flight. They had to think of creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which felt like a big roller coaster.

During the flight, the plane went up high and then down quickly. When it went up, the engines stopped, and for a few seconds, everything inside felt weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth. 

The plane took off smoothly, but soon it climbed steeply. The students felt heavy, and some fell on the floor. Then, the plane went weightless. For 20 seconds, they floated in the air. It was like jumping on a trampoline. They could not tell which way was up or down.

After a while, the pilot brought the plane back down. Some students landed hard. They had 30 curves to go through, which gave them 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments. 

One group of students studied a robot cat named Leonardo. They wanted to see how cats land on their feet. Another group from Germany looked at how metal joins change in space. A team from Utah tried to make solar sails from special films. They hoped these sails could help satellites use sunlight like a boat uses wind.

After two hours of flying, the students felt excited. They had a great time and wanted to be astronauts even more. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience!"""
CAE_3,"**Title: Planting Trees in New Zealand**

Jonathon Porritt is a writer. He wrote a book called ""Seeing Green."" 

Jonathon had a special time in his life when he did not have any summers. He went to New Zealand every summer, but it was winter there. He had nine winters in a row, and he liked it because he enjoys winter.

His parents had an idea. They wanted to buy a small piece of land for Jonathon and his brother and sister. His mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This was a nice idea because Jonathon's father grew up in New Zealand. They found land about 20 miles from Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was good for planting trees.

Jonathon liked the idea of planting trees. He had worked in Australia on farms, so he was excited. He started planting trees in 1968. By 1972, he and his siblings had planted trees on 70 acres of land.

In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. It was cold and wet while they were planting. Every morning, Jonathon had to get ready to work in the rain. He had to put on wet clothes and boots. Sometimes, he had strange thoughts while working.

In his first year, Jonathon worked with a man who knew how to plant trees. This helped him because he had never done it before. He used a bag to carry trees. When the bag was full, it was heavy. It was easier when the bag was lighter.

To plant the trees, Jonathon had to make straight lines. He used poles to help him. Once he was in line, he planted trees until he reached the end, then he turned around and came back. He liked the hard work, and it made him strong.

After a while, planting trees became easier. Jonathon learned a rhythm. He took the tree from the bag, dug a hole, put the tree in, and moved on. While planting, he thought a lot about nature and life.

Jonathon went back to New Zealand four times. He saw the trees grow, and it made him happy. He worried when he read about bad weather in New Zealand, but the trees grew well. Now, they are 20 years old.

In 1984, Jonathon took time off from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. He wrote his first book there. He stayed in a simple cabin with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, he wrote. In the afternoons, he took care of the trees. He felt a strong connection to the land. It was a special place for him."
CAE_10,"**Taking Care of Badger Cubs**

One day, I got a cardboard box from one of my helpers. I was curious because I heard strange noises from the box. When I looked inside, I saw three small grey badger cubs. They were about eight inches long and had soft, velvety fur. Their eyes were white, and they had black-and-white stripes on their heads. I had never seen badger cubs before.

These cubs were found by builders. They accidentally dug into the place where the mother badger lived. The mother was dead, but the cubs were still alive. They were cold and scared. I took them to my kitchen to keep them warm. I named the two girls Primrose and Bluebell, and the boy was named Willow.

At first, I fed them with a syringe. I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to help them feel like their mother was cleaning them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around.

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was not very active. He was still eating, but something was wrong. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. It was my fault because I let him drink too fast. I was sad, but I took care of Primrose and Bluebell.

Then, a farmer found another badger cub. This cub was alone and hungry. I named him Willow II. He was younger than the girls. He was hard to feed because he would not drink from the bottle easily. After a week, he learned to eat sausages. 

By five months old, all the cubs were eating different foods like cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, and nuts. Badgers usually eat worms, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were doing well, even though it was a hot summer.

In August, the badgers started to go out at night. They liked to play and chase each other. I had to be careful because they sometimes nipped at me. One night, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food. Badgers can be very protective of their space, so we had to be careful.

We decided to build a home for the badgers on our farm. My son Daniel helped design it. We made a sett with tunnels and a special gate. Many people helped us with money and materials. 

Finally, the badgers moved into their new home. I watched them and then left them alone. Later, I came back and saw them sleeping in their chambers. Now, I don’t walk with them as much because they stay up late. Primrose has moved to another sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before they run off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley. Halley is famous for the comet named after him. He also did important work with compasses.

Sir Edmund Halley lived from 1656 to 1742. He traveled on a ship called the Paramore. He studied how compasses work. He found out that compasses can be wrong. This is called ""declination."" It is the difference between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to find their way on the ocean.

Halley wanted to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. He first tried to go to the Cape Verde Islands, but he had to turn back because of problems with his crew. Later, he sailed to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he made a map showing compass variations in the oceans. This map helped sailors for many years.

Now, Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip. He plans to follow Halley's route. He needs to raise £70,000 to do this. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led a famous expedition in Antarctica, is helping him.

Dr. Clark learned about Halley while he was in Antarctica. He read many books about Halley. He says Halley had an amazing life. He was a great scientist and went on many trips. Halley also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his work.

Dr. Clark wants to recreate Halley's journey. He will take new measurements of the magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field changes slowly, so these measurements are important. He will use satellites to help find true north.

The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will give him tools for his trip. A Danish satellite will also take measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his work will help scientists understand the Atlantic Ocean better.

Halley's journey was very important. It was the first scientific trip at sea. Halley was the first civilian to be a naval captain for this kind of work. 

Dr. Clark has experience for this journey. He spent two years in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to do the trip in four parts with different crews. He is very dedicated to this project. He says Halley inspires him and gives him a purpose."
CAE_27,"**Peacocks and Their Tails**

Every summer, peacocks walk around Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. They show their beautiful tails to the peahens (female peacocks). This makes people wonder why peacocks have such big and colorful tails. 

A scientist named Charles Darwin thought that animals change over time to survive better. He said that the strongest animals usually survive and have babies. But peacocks have big tails that can make it hard for them to run away from danger. Darwin thought that peahens liked peacocks because of their beauty. 

Another scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He believed that peahens choose peacocks with the best tails because those peacocks have something special that helps them survive. 

Now, 100 years later, scientists are still studying this. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. The scientists want to find out two things: Do peahens really like the peacocks with the biggest tails? And do those peacocks have something extra that helps them survive?

The scientists watch the peacocks and take pictures. They see that peahens do like the peacocks with the biggest and most colorful tails. The number of eye spots on the tail matters. Peacocks with more eye spots attract more mates. 

A scientist named William Hamilton thinks that peacocks with big tails might be healthier and have fewer parasites. But the scientists at Whipsnade have not checked this yet. This year, they are looking at the babies of attractive peacocks to see if they grow faster and are healthier.

There is also an interesting idea from a scientist named R A Fisher. He said that if a female peahen likes a peacock with a slightly better tail, her babies will have long tails too. This means that over time, peacocks will have even longer tails because of what the females like.

In the end, this shows that peahens might choose peacocks for their beauty, just like Darwin thought."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe says the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He made his own boat called 'The Westerman'. This week, there is a big boat show in London with many beautiful yachts and new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. 

My boat is different. It is quiet and sits in a small creek by the sea. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic person because of this boat. Maybe I am, but I don’t think so. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but it also uses some new technology. 

New technology helps with building boats, but it can also make sailing too easy. Some sailors want to feel the real sea life, not just sit back and relax. I think it is important to have a warm stove and a comfortable place to sleep on a boat. But if the sails do everything by themselves, what is the fun in that? 

When I had my first boat, Hirta, I sailed around Britain for a TV show. The last owner said Hirta was comfortable but not fancy. He was right. Hirta had heavy sails and no electricity, no fridge, and no fancy gadgets, but she was easy to sail. 

However, old boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a new boat but could not find one I liked, so I decided to build a new one. 

The Westerman has been great. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew the boat on a napkin and then used a computer to make it better. We made a model like boat builders did a long time ago. The final design was perfect. 

The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. It looks beautiful, sails well, and feels peaceful inside. This is because it was made just for sailing, not for living like a house. 

The Westerman is made of wood that keeps water out. It has the good parts of a modern boat but looks and feels like a classic boat."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Many health farms and country hotels with spas are very popular now. Five journalists visited some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I went to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and wanted to relax. My room was very comfortable. On the first day, I slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The teachers were very good. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They have many treatments like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and manicures. The facial treatment made me feel great. The staff were very friendly and professional. Henlow is going to make some changes this year, including a new swimming pool. You can ride bicycles or take a nice walk in the garden. I felt happy and full of energy when I left. I want to go back!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. When I arrived, I saw a big staircase and a nice library. Everyone gets a health check when they arrive. They called us patients, which felt strange because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem and helped me with it. Each person gets a special diet. I lost some weight but felt hungry. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit. If you want more food, you can eat in the main dining hall. You can also have massages and other treatments. 

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it is a nice place with a cozy lounge. The food is very good but rich, so you might want to be careful if you count calories. There is a gym and a pool to help you stay active. They have a spa and a clinic for sports injuries. I got advice for my shoulder pain. Careys is comfortable and relaxing, and there is beautiful countryside to explore.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a beautiful country home and a five-star hotel. It has health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, and more. There are lovely walks in the gardens. The restaurant has amazing food. I enjoyed my meal very much! The next morning, I worked out in the gym. I also had a facial and a massage. Cliveden has everything you need for fitness and relaxation.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
Springs Hydro has the best carrot cake I have ever tasted, but it has a lot of calories! The aromatherapy massage was also great. I felt very relaxed and slept well after. The place is modern and has many beauty rooms. There are many different treatments available. The guests are a mix of people, like families and friends. I would love to visit Springs Hydro every month!"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We share more than 98% of our genes. This means that the differences between us and animals are small and new. 

Many studies show that animals can do things we thought only humans could do. For example, chimpanzees use sticks to eat and to fight. Sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple sounds to warn each other about danger, like ""leopard"" or ""snake."" 

Art is one thing that seems special to humans. But it is strange that our ancestors did not make art for almost 7 million years. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we cannot find these old things. The first clear art we have is from the Cro-Magnons, about 35,000 years ago. They made cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

Some people say human art is different from animal art in three ways: 

1. Human art is not for survival. It does not help us live or have babies. Most animal behavior helps them survive. For example, birds sing to protect their homes or attract mates.

2. Human art is made for beauty. We do not know if birds enjoy their songs, but they sing mostly when they want to mate. This suggests they do not sing just for fun.

3. Human art is learned. Each group of people has its own art style. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. People can learn from each other. But some birds are born knowing their songs. They sing the right song even if they have never heard it.

Human art changes quickly. For example, people can tell when a painting was made just by looking at it. But chimpanzees, like Congo and Betsy, also made paintings. Congo made many paintings in one day and was happy to do it. Their paintings were shown in a gallery in London in 1957, and many sold. 

So, the art of chimpanzees and humans is similar in some ways. Both are made for enjoyment, not for survival. Some people might say human art is different because it is meant to communicate. But sometimes, famous human art was made just for the artist's own pleasure."
CAE_39,"**A Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very big and dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed this desert and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left in the world. In the past, stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and narrow eyes looking into the distance. Now, we do not see these heroes in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Charles Blackmore led a group to cross the Taklamakan Desert. The name means ""once you enter, you never come out,"" but people also call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of this journey at his home. His team had four British people, one American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous.

They started to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He wanted to have fun and find out who he really was. His wife, Tina, was worried he would not come back because no one had done this journey before. It took them 59 days to cross the desert, and they were lucky.

In his story, Charles talks about how hard it was. They had stomach problems, very hot and cold weather, and they were very thirsty. They lost some of their water. But when they were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, they found some. They did not have the big sandstorms or the freezing cold that could have stopped them. But they still had many problems. The sand got into their wounds, and climbing the high dunes was very hard for them and the camels.

Charles said, ""What pushed me to keep going was the need to survive."" They had no backup plan. No planes flew over them. Once they were in the sand, they were alone. He was scared about his strength to finish the trip. On the first day, it was so hot that he could hardly breathe. He thought, ""We have to do this now!"" He was very scared.

At the end of the journey, they felt different. After walking 1,000 kilometers, they could not stop. They were very thin but strong. Charles felt proud of his body. He could walk over anything.

In the middle of his story, Charles described lying in the desert and looking at the full moon, thinking about his family. He felt he was trying to find peace inside himself. When he has doubts now, he remembers the desert and feels proud of what they did. But he thinks about his family and the happiness they share. To him, that is more important than the desert.

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? He said, ""I want the challenge and the open spaces. We felt good about our purpose. Now, it is hard for me to be part of normal life."""
CAE_18,"**Simplified Text:**

Susan Harr is tired of using too many gadgets. She decides to unplug them and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it makes life easier. But Susan thinks that we depend too much on it. 

One day, her computer broke. It cost a lot of money to fix it. This made her think that gadgets are not always worth it. She wonders if technology really gives us more time. Sometimes, it seems like we just buy more gadgets to do more things.

When her computer made strange noises, she put it outside. Now, she can take her time doing things without a noisy machine. She feels safer sewing by hand instead of using a fast sewing machine. 

Susan also learned that living without some gadgets can be nice. For example, she returned her color TV and now uses a small black-and-white TV. This helps her spend more time walking her dog, reading, and talking with family. 

She used to think sewing by hand was hard and boring. But now, she enjoys it. She can listen to the radio or talk to friends while she sews. It feels good to sit by the fire with a cup of tea and sew. 

Susan is now looking around her house and asking if she really needs all her gadgets. She thinks about saving money by not using things like the freezer or microwave. She is happy to do things by hand and enjoy life more."
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker. He makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he shakes my hand quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" He seems busy. The workshop has many pieces of furniture and wood in different colors. 

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years. Many people know him and want his furniture. He does not advertise, but people say he is very good. If you want a nice cupboard, table, or bookcase, you should ask Hurst.

It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is hard to find one like Hurst. He wants to make furniture that looks nice and is well-made. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now."" He is not happy with some furniture that is made today. He thinks some furniture is not good and people should want better.

Hurst is very confident in his work. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his work is for private people, not companies. Some clients come back to him many times. He likes it when clients know what they want.

Hurst is also nice about other people. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He does not like when some craftsmen take a long time to make one piece of furniture. He thinks furniture should be useful, not just for show. 

Hurst is confident, but he is also humble. He says, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" as I leave."
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People sleep for about one-third of their lives. Sleep is very important, but we do not know exactly why. Scientists have three main ideas about why we sleep.

The first idea says that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. When we sleep, our bodies fix any damage from the day and help us feel better.

The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us remember things we learned during the day. Without sleep, it is hard to learn new things.

The third idea is about energy. This idea says we need sleep to recharge our energy. When we sleep, we get ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, some people like to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to newspapers about many topics.

Being eccentric shows our individuality. Inside us, there are two forces. One is called individualism, which means being yourself. The other is conformity, which means following the crowd. Most people want to fit in and be liked. This desire is often stronger than the wish to be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs and meet to talk about what they like or their problems. They want to be with others who understand them, even if others think they are strange.

We all feel a struggle between wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. Sometimes, we want to show our individuality. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think."" Or a new person might say, ""You must take me as I am."" 

Anyone can choose to be more individual. Some people become very successful by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you feel what you are doing, go for it and don’t give up. You will surprise many people."" 

However, being different just to get attention is not true eccentricity. If a singer wears strange clothes just to be noticed, that is not eccentric. But if they keep being different for a long time, they may become eccentric. 

True eccentrics are not trying to be odd; they just are. They do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress others or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives happily, no matter what others think."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four nature experts to tell us about their favorite wildlife books.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy to choose the author. I am an environmental journalist, and I have met many important people in this field. One of them is Barbara Ward. She is a small, weak woman, but she is very important for environmental issues in Europe. She has combined her experiences into her own ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand many things. Choosing her book was harder. I could have chosen ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" It talks about the fast growth of cities and important themes in her life. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books, but none are as good as this one.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of seagulls and remember the smell of the sun. This book explains animal communication very well with words and pictures. If you read it and then watch a group of seagulls, you will see how they work together. Niko Tinbergen was a great scientist who wanted to share his ideas with everyone. He worked with a talented artist, Eric Ennion, to make this book interesting for all nature lovers. Eric's paintings show how birds act, like when one bird is aggressive and another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell has changed my life the most. It helped me find a wonderful husband and a great job in conservation. This book made me love the natural world. I was in Madagascar studying animal sounds when I first read it. I was feeling sad because of many problems, but when I read the book, I felt happy again. It shows animals and people together in a beautiful world. Some people think humans are bad for nature, but I remember Gerald as a boy, seeing all living things as a family. We need to understand this idea.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library when it was first published in 1966. I loved it right away, especially the beautiful pictures of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and learned to identify birds during my holidays. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had so much more. It had amazing paintings, stories about bird migration, and even a chapter about birds in music and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in many ways. It showed me that my feelings about nature are just as important as scientific facts. Since I was better at art than math, I saw a new path for myself."
CAE_37,"**Do Reviews Help Sell Books?**

We asked five British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in the newspaper. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or displays in shops. Authors feel sad when there are no reviews. Publishers also feel bad about bad reviews, but they think any review is good because it gets people talking about the book. Publishers like reviews that match their own feelings about a book.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both want good book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to see their books reviewed well. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help readers find their books. Good reviews from trusted people can help sell more books.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. Many of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we need reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are better than ads because they show the book is good without being paid for. Publishers say they want big reviews, but it is hard to know how much reviews help sales. Good reviews can help a book become popular, but they need help from other things like word-of-mouth and good marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I am not sure how publishing and reviewing work together in Britain. In the United States, one review can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops do not always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes a long time for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews still sell very well. It is hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction books let reviewers talk more about the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they help sell books? I published a biography with great reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could just read the reviews. The name of the reviewer can matter. Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would buy it. Now, sometimes a surprising reviewer or a clever review can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

Making weathervanes is an old skill. It started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith makes weathervanes in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes them by hand. 

Graham creates special designs for his customers. He says, ""This way, I can make a unique gift."" Many of his customers are women. They want special gifts for their husbands that show their interests.

Most weathervanes have a cockerel design. But the first weathervane Graham made was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make more. Graham saw that he could make many different designs.

Graham used to work as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed jobs. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of the children and build his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He enjoys the creative work of making weathervanes.

Graham has made over 100 original designs. He pays attention to detail and asks customers for their approval before he starts cutting. He also keeps some traditional designs because people like them too. 

Graham believes people like handmade things. They want something different. He does not want to make his business bigger. He wants to keep it a small craft. He enjoys seeing a simple shape turn into something beautiful.

For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather. Now, more people are moving to the countryside. They want to add special touches to their homes. This helps crafts like Graham's business.

Graham is busy making weathervanes for customers all over the world. People from America and Denmark are interested in his work. The price of a weathervane depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was a very popular book. It is the first book by British writer Nicholas Evans. He earned a lot of money from it. Here, he talks about his ideas and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans had a hard time. He was a screenwriter and wanted to be a director. His film project, *Life and Limb*, did not work out. He was sad and worried because he had not made money for two years. He needed money to pay the bank.

A smart person would have found a job. Nicholas could have gone back to television. But he did something different. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months. He had an idea for the story from a farrier he met in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were very worried until they found a gypsy who could talk to the horse and change it back. These people are called ""horse whisperers."" 

Nicholas was very interested. He wanted to write a movie about it. But after his film project failed, he decided to write a book instead. He traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses. He felt alone and worried about his life. He had tried for ten years to be a filmmaker, but now he was in debt and worried about his family.

By the end of August, he had written half of the book. The bank was pressing him for money, and he needed to know if he should keep going. He showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Nicholas could get $30,000 for it. Nicholas needed more money to pay his debts. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and needed two more months to finish it.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the book to seven publishers in the UK. Soon, his agent called to say they had turned down an offer of $75,000. Nicholas was surprised. The agent felt something good was going to happen.

A week later, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. This was a record for a first novel. Nicholas and his team were shocked. They had not sent the book to New York, but soon major movie studios wanted it too. 

Nicholas was offered $3 million for the movie rights. He was amazed. Four famous filmmakers called him to ask for the chance to make the movie. Nicholas decided not to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He felt it was a fairy tale and did not want to spoil it. He wanted to write another novel instead."
CAE_23,"**Bobby Fischer and Chess**

Bobby Fischer is a famous chess player. He is trying to come back to chess after being away for 20 years. Chess is now a game for younger players. Bobby is 49 years old. He played his old rival, Boris Spassky, and won the first game. But Bobby is not the same player he was in 1972. He is older and not as fit.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Now, many players are younger. Most of the top ten players in the world are under 30 years old. The game is also played differently now. Players prepare a lot before matches. They use computers to study many chess games. This helps them find ways to win.

A chess game can last a long time, sometimes up to eight hours. Players must stay focused. If they make a mistake, they can lose. There is a chess clock that makes the game more exciting. Players have to make their moves quickly, or they will lose.

Winning a game is very important. It feels great to win, but players must be ready to play again the next day. Chess tournaments can last for many days. Bobby Fischer loves chess. He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" If he is back for the money, he will earn a lot. But if he wants to prove he is the best, it could be very hard for him."

It will not be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented. Before he wrote Peaches, he had never been to a play or read one. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I did not think it would be shown."" The play is about people in a car. He left school at 16 but went back a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He wanted to write for actors. He liked being with people who thought like him. He enjoyed learning there.

**B** Simon Pegg is 28 years old. He studied drama at Bristol University. Now, he is writing a comedy show for TV. He just finished a long tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon worked hard from the start. He performed in comedy clubs while at university. He says, ""University was very theoretical. I learned I did not want to be a serious actor. I like comedy more."" He thinks comedy is not the hardest job. If you have courage and good ideas, it is great to make people laugh.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin is 24 years old. He became famous when he acted in a show called The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. People liked his performance. Now, he can choose what jobs he wants to do. He started acting in school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. He jokes, ""I used acting to avoid homework."" He decided to take acting seriously because he liked it. Now, he waits for good things to happen. He says, ""When you are 18, you think fame is great, but you learn it is not why you act. You act for respect.""

CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Some writers talk about international volunteer work. 

A. It is hard to say that volunteer work helps a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If they gave this money to the local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can give. This is true for young people who take gap years. They often do not have special skills or experience. Many studies ask if young people volunteer to help others or to help themselves in their careers. But these projects can help people learn to be kind and help others in the future.

B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can help solve problems and create connections between people from different countries. When this happens, both the volunteers and the local communities can benefit. But if only rich people can volunteer, it helps them more than the communities that need help. The volunteers will gain experience, but the local people may not get much help.

C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to feel good about themselves. It can also be a way to give real help to communities. At its best, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the communities. It can also help people understand the problems of poverty and unfairness in the world.

D. Volunteer tourism is part of a trend where people want to help others. This can seem good, especially when people do not trust big governments or businesses. But it can also ignore the need for real change in poor communities. Volunteering can be a good thing, but when it is only seen as a way to help without understanding the bigger problems, it can miss the point. It is important to understand the real issues of poverty and inequality in the world."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports

Many people listen to the radio in the morning. We often need an alarm to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one?

I tested five clock radios with Tom Granger, an inventor, and Paul Bridges, a broadcaster. One clock radio has a 'dual alarm function.' This means you can set two different wake-up times. One for work days and one for weekends. But who needs two alarms? 

This clock radio costs about the same as another one we tested. It has a cassette player, so you can listen to your own music. The radio quality is very good, but the clock radio is big, like a rugby ball. Paul said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also likes to book a wake-up call, just in case the alarm does not work.

This clock radio was voted the best. Paul said he loved it, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 4:00 PM. I liked the digital display with nice grey numbers on a green background. The snooze button is big, so you can press it easily when you are sleepy. 

The clock has a backup battery, so it still works if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. However, it was hard to set up. But when we finished, we felt cool and smart. 

Tom did not like one model with a built-in lamp. He said it was hard to use. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work. The light was not good for reading; it only shines on the clock. Paul thought the lamp idea was funny, but he said the radio was hard to tune.

Another model is very popular. It is bright and colorful. Tom and I liked it because it stands out. It was easy to set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can go off 10 minutes early or late, which is silly. Paul thought this model was hard to use and not good.

The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easier to set up. We all agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small animal. It has sharp spines on its body. You can find hedgehogs in many places in the world, but not in America or Australia. When a hedgehog is in danger, it can roll into a tight ball. The spines stick out to protect it.

Some hedgehogs live in the desert. They have fewer spines and may run away from danger instead of rolling up. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night. They sleep during the day under bushes or in holes in the ground.

Hedgehogs can hibernate, which means they sleep for a long time in winter. But not all hedgehogs hibernate. Some stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen Winning**

It is hard to be good at sports. Women have to work even harder than men. They train a lot and have little time for normal life. They make sacrifices. But they are winning and breaking records. Here are some amazing British sportswomen.

A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love to ski. It feels great to jump and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes I feel sick or it is windy, but I keep going. I train for ten months each year, so I miss time with friends. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete together and are treated the same.""

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else! I earn good money as a professional cyclist. I train for at least four hours every day. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""

C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because few schools have rowing teams. Most girls start late, at 19 or 20. This makes it hard to be successful. But I love rowing and being fit. It is also fun to be with friends.""

D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I didn’t know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very hard. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep. I got the record! Some people think women are less likely to succeed, so they do not want to sponsor us.""

E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men think they are better drivers. When I do well, they ignore me. Being a woman in racing is hard. Men want to beat me, and I have had many accidents. It is tough to earn money, and I spend what I make on racing. More women are racing now, which is great!""

F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 AM three days a week to swim. I need to sleep on other mornings. In the evening, I cycle or run. Sometimes I feel tired at work! I push myself hard when I race. Men and women usually compete together, but the news talks more about men. The prize money for women is less, but we are working to change that."""
CAE_34,"**Text: Meeting Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers a special day when he met the famous artist, Picasso. He was 78 years old and eating lunch in a restaurant in Cannes. Even from far away, you could see it was Picasso.

At that time, I was 18 years old. I was traveling in a van around Europe and Morocco. I had no money, so I found a job painting boats. But I loved to draw, and I had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso usually stayed at home and worked. So, I was very surprised to see him at a table with his wife and friends. My friend told me to ask for his signature. I was nervous, but I went over and introduced myself. To my surprise, he signed my sketchbook and even drew a fun line on the page.

I was very happy and thanked him. We started to talk, but Picasso did not speak much English, and my French was not good. An American woman at the table helped us talk. She called him ""the Maestro."" I told Picasso that I loved art and admired his work.

After a while, I went back to my boat to show my friend what I got. But my friend said, ""Is that all? Go back and talk to him more!"" So, I took my sketchbook and went back to Picasso.

I did not ask him if I could draw his portrait because I was afraid he would say no. Instead, I just stood there and started to draw. When Picasso saw me, he made funny faces to make it hard for me to draw. He acted like a clown, and I wanted to stop, but I kept going.

Finally, he sat still for me. I looked at him closely. He looked strong and young for his age. His eyes were bright and full of life. Even though he was with friends, he seemed alone and quiet.

The American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing. I felt shy and said it was not good enough. But Picasso wanted to see it. When I showed him, he smiled and nodded. Then he took my crayon and quickly drew a face on my paper. It was very different from my drawing!

I thanked Picasso and asked him to sign my drawing. The American lady said he said I already had his signature. I felt lucky to meet him and to have his attention. It was a wonderful day for me."
CAE_12,"**Shopping Tricks**

Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use tricks to make you spend more money. 

A. **Fresh Food**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They may also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The color green is often used because it makes people think of fresh food.

B. **Product Placement**  
Where products are in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out where people like to shop. They put popular items at eye level so people can see them easily. They also have special bins with discounts to attract shoppers.

C. **Moving Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place cheap items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting items. Stores may also put popular products far away, hoping customers will look for them and see other things to buy.

D. **Less is More**  
Some stores, like Next, show their clothes in a nice way. They do not put many items on the shelves. This makes the clothes look special, even if they are made in large amounts.

E. **Total Price**  
Shoppers often care more about the total price of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items to attract customers. They may sell some items at a loss to bring people in.

F. **Price Tags**  
In chain stores, shoppers notice prices more. For example, a blouse priced at £14.99 seems cheaper than one at £15. This also helps reduce theft because workers must ring up sales to give change.

G. **Lighting**  
Stores think a lot about lighting. Chain stores use lights that look like natural sunlight so customers can see colors well. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh fruits and vegetables look better.

H. **Store Layout**  
Many stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the way to walk, and another shows where to buy things. Some stores use nice carpets to make shoppers feel welcome in sales areas.

I. **In-Store Ads**  
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of delicious food. In some places, shopping carts have screens that show ads for products while you shop. This is to catch the attention of shoppers and make them buy more."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington is a famous mountaineer. He climbed Mount Everest in 1985. He has also climbed in Britain and the Alps. He wrote many books, like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way.""

Robin Knox-Johnston started his career at sea. In 1968-1969, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat, Sunhaili. He also set a record for sailing from New York to England in 10 days.

Chris and Robin went to Greenland to sail and climb. They wrote a book about their trip called ""Sea, Ice and Rock."" In 1979, Chris called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to sail with him. Chris could teach Robin climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht.

They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat. Chris and Robin went to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was hard, but Robin did well. Chris asked Robin if he had climbed before. Robin said no, so Chris showed him how to climb down. Robin wanted to use his arms like on the boat, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Robin climbed down safely.

During this trip, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they go to Greenland together. Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone for their ideas before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring. He liked being on land more than being at sea. Robin liked sailing and fixing things on the boat.

When they reached Greenland, Chris had to lead the climbing. He worried about Robin's safety. Climbing the highest mountain in Greenland, called the Cathedral, was very hard. They climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were very tired. Robin trusted Chris and followed him. When it was too hard, they turned back. Robin was also worried about their boat.

On the way home, there was a small problem. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his turn to watch the boat, but Robin did not wake him. Chris felt Robin did not trust him. Robin quickly said that was not true. 

They enjoyed their trip to Skye, but they really got to know each other in Greenland. Chris found out that Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A Simple History of Apples**

Apples have been around for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of the old types of apples.

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. Long ago, people found apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. They even saved apple halves for winter. These apples were small and wild, very different from the apples we eat today.

**Learning from the Romans (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. Some apples, like the dessert apple called Decio, came from the Romans. But many Roman apples did not grow well in Britain. British monks started to grow new types of apples.

**Popular Apples in the Middle Ages (1200)**  
In the 1200s, many apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a favorite dessert apple. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. But bad times came with droughts and diseases, and fewer apples were grown. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn more about apples. This man brought back many new apple types.

**Apples in New Lands (1750)**  
By the 1600s, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. A man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees in North America.

**New Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree. He named the apple 'Delicious' because a judge said it was very tasty. Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She found a small tree and grew green apples that became very popular.

**Many Apples Today (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. But most apples come from just a few types. Many of these apples look good but do not taste very good. Some old apple types are still grown by gardeners in the UK, but many have been lost in the US. People want to see more types of apples again. We should care about keeping different kinds of apples for everyone."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners. He visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is in the mountains, ten miles south of the equator. The camp is near Mount Kenya, which is the highest mountain in Kenya. Richard has trained in Kenya for three years, but he has never trained with Kenyan runners before.

On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard decided to train with the Kenyan runners. He ran in his first race in Kenya. He was invited to the training camp by the Kenyan national team coach after he finished fifth in a big race. This was a great chance for him.

Training in the mountains helps runners because it makes their bodies better at using oxygen. Many Kenyan runners are very successful because of this training. Richard's first race in Africa was special because it was the first international cross-country race in Africa. In this race, many runners finished ahead of him, and most of them were Kenyan.

Kenyan runners are known for their simple way of training. They run easily, eat simple food, and enjoy competing. Richard learned how they train at the national team camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, high up on Mount Kenya. The athletes live in simple rooms with other students. 

Every day, they have three training sessions: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the afternoon. They start their day early, at six in the morning. The total distance they run each day is about 40 kilometres, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometres.

Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, and vegetables. After running, they go to a stream to wash.

By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just because of their genes or the high mountains. It is also about their simple life, hard work, and love for running. These things help them become great runners."
CAE_7,"**Simplified Text:**

Advertising is not doing well. This problem started in 1989, before the economy got bad. Advertising is not keeping up with changes in the economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people, but now there are many different groups. Even big brands should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.

Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You may only buy a few well-known brands. In a year, you probably buy about 400 different brands. But there are many more brands advertised, about 32,500. Most people only buy a small number of these brands.

When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. Most people find that they only buy from 1 out of 16 ads. This means that many ads are not useful for them. Many people think they are different and do not pay attention to ads, but this is not true. Most people do not buy the brands they see in ads.

Advertising can be wasteful. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. It can reach many people, and some will respond. Advertisers cannot know who will buy their products, so they need to reach a lot of people.

If an advertiser knows who will buy, they can talk to them directly. For example, if an ad can get one million new customers, that is very good. A successful ad campaign can reach a small part of the population. To be successful again, advertising needs to focus more on specific groups of people."

Charles Clover visits a very green home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This place has two interesting things. First, it has Southwell Minster, a little-known old cathedral with special carvings of 'green' men. Second, it has the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 

The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle waste into compost for their garden. They also heat their home using heat from their appliances and their bodies, plus the heat from their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. 

The house looks traditional with a clay roof and is near the Minster. It is very quiet inside because it has special windows that keep out noise. When you enter, you must take off your shoes. Inside, it is calm and warm. The windows are closed, and the conservatory helps warm the air. 

Robert opens windows to let fresh air in. The house is designed to keep out drafts. The Vales care about the environment and wrote a book about green homes in the 1970s. They wanted to build a house that does not harm the environment. They do not use city water and have special toilets that use compost. They also have tanks for rainwater and filters for drinking water. 

The Vales do not pay for water. Last winter, they used very little electricity, much less than a normal four-bedroom house. Soon, they will add solar panels to make even more electricity. They will still use some electricity from the city for cooking. 

In winter, they only use a small wood stove to stay warm. One night in February, Robert said it was too warm to use the stove. The temperature was 18C, which is comfortable for them. The house is designed to keep the heat in, so it feels warm even when it is cooler outside. 

The house is simple and easy to build. It cost the same as low-cost homes. Many building companies do not want to build homes like this."

Arthur Conan Doyle made the Sherlock Holmes stories. He thought he was a smart man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw pictures of fairies in a garden. He believed these pictures were proof that fairies are real. He wrote an article and shared the pictures, saying fairies are wonderful.

But in 1939, the two women who took the pictures said they were fake. They cut out fairy pictures from a book and put them in flowers. The pictures are very pretty. But this simple trick shows that photography can lie.

In the 1700s, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. But by the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain. Big factories did not need them anymore. Many new buildings did not use nice ironwork.

In the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become popular again. People like decorative buildings and new designs. However, some of the new work looks old-fashioned. Many shops sell items that look like they are from the past.

There are events to help blacksmiths. One event is an exhibition of ironwork by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). It opened last week in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says this could be a new time for blacksmiths. They can now use power tools, which make their work easier. 

About 250 pieces of ironwork are in the show. They include bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most money will go to the blacksmiths, but some will help the Association.

Alan Dawson has made a big gate and a lamp. He says working with hot steel is like drawing with metal. Many artists love working with iron. It is soft when hot but hard when it cools down. 

Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles. Some of her designs look like things from scary movies. She likes that steel feels cold and strong. 

Iron is a special metal. It can be used for beautiful things for many years to come. But let’s hope we don’t see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Stopped Smoking**

I stopped smoking, and I thought my friends would be happy. But one friend was very angry. She asked, ""What do you mean? If it was easy, why didn’t you stop before?"" I could not explain how I stopped. It was strange for me too. 

I went to a stop-smoking class two months and three weeks ago. I did not plan to stop smoking. I did not really want to stop. I felt pressure from people who do not like smoking, and I still feel that way. My family is healthy, and I did not feel sick. I thought I was fine.

That Thursday, I went to the class to write about it. I said, ""I will not stop smoking. I am here to write, not to stop."" I liked smoking. It made me happy. The teacher looked at me like she knew something. We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. 

When I was told to smoke, I did not want to. The messages about stopping smoking made sense to me. I started to think that stopping could be good. I felt strong. 

Stopping was not hard. The need for cigarettes went away after a few days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was easy. The hardest part was being at home on weekends. I realized that smoking helped me not feel bored. 

I miss smoking a little, but not too much. Now, I have to think about what to do in new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane. Before, I would smoke in these moments."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is a very important British woman scientist. She won the Nobel Prize, but many people do not know her name. For four years, I have asked my friends if they know about her. If they do, I am happy. 

Dorothy Hodgkin is special because she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. She died in 1994. She studied crystals and had a very interesting life. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like better education for women and the growth of science around the world.

When I started to learn more about her, I wanted to read about other scientists. I looked for a book about Linus Pauling, who was a friend of Dorothy. He was also a famous scientist and won Nobel Prizes. But I could not find any books about him in the bookshop. I was surprised because he was very important.

Some people think that stories about scientists are boring. A famous scientist, Peter Medawar, said that the lives of scientists are not interesting. This makes it hard for people to see scientists as interesting people. 

But now, more scientists are showing their personalities. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on TV, and Steve Jones advertises cars. This helps people see scientists as real people.

Books about scientists are also changing. They used to be very serious and not fun to read. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" are funny and interesting. Famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Marie Curie are now shown with their personal lives too.

Dorothy Hodgkin worked very hard. She found out how penicillin and vitamin B12 are made, which won her the Nobel Prize in 1964. She also helped find out how insulin is made. She had three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life is important, and we can learn from how she balanced everything.

Understanding science can be hard, but it is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. It just takes time and effort. It is sad that many educated people do not know about great scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers need her help because their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines, but Margaret only needs her stick to find water. She is very good at it, with a success rate of over 90%.

This skill is called dowsing. Some people think it is a special ability. There are many ideas about how it works. One idea is that everything vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or smell water.

In recent years, many farmers have asked for Margaret's help. She usually sees each customer only once because wells last a long time. Some of her customers have holiday homes far away and do not want to pay for long water pipes. Others are building golf courses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She must be careful to avoid waste getting into the water. The water she finds is clean, but she must watch for minerals like iron.

To find water, Margaret first looks at a map. She uses a pendulum, which swings over areas with water. Then, she walks with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels something strange. She uses the stick to find the best place to drill. If the stick rises, it means water is below.

Margaret and her husband check the same area. If they do not agree on where to drill, they keep looking until they do. 

Margaret's skill is interesting to many people. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special way of understanding where water is. Thanks to her skill, she and her family can keep their well-drilling business going year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever wanted to live someone else's life for a day? Four people did this! Here are their stories.

**Amanda's Story**  
Amanda is 23 years old and has two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. Amanda went to the restaurant and was surprised. It was dark, loud, and full of people. It was very different from her quiet home. 

Amanda had to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. It was hard! She dropped the drinks, and they spilled everywhere. Everyone laughed, and Amanda felt embarrassed. When the restaurant opened, there was a long line of customers. Amanda was nervous but happy that the orders were easy to remember because they were on a computer. 

After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. She had to ask customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift, she was very tired. She realized that being a waitress is not easy. She was glad to go back to her children because being a mom felt easier after that day!

**Cindy's Story**  
Cindy is 30 years old and was nervous about being a mom for a day. She had to take care of Amanda's two daughters. First, she dressed them and took them to school. She thought she would have some quiet time, but she was wrong! 

Cindy had to clean the house and do laundry. After picking up the girls, they played and made a mess. They were very loud! Cindy tried to relax, but the girls had too much energy. It was hard to get them to bed. They kept asking for water so they could come downstairs to watch TV. 

Cindy learned that taking care of children is very tiring. She enjoyed the day but felt very responsible for the girls.

**Rosemary's Story**  
Rosemary is 42 years old and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a teacher. Rosemary got to sleep in a little longer, which was nice! At school, she felt nervous in front of many students. 

She helped the children with their work and even did a fun nature project. But she was tired by lunchtime. Teachers have very little time to eat. After lunch, she had to help with sports and teach a French lesson. Speaking in front of the class was hard for her. 

Rosemary decided she liked farming better than teaching.

**Hilary's Story**  
Hilary is 30 years old and went to Rosemary's farm early in the morning. She found out that Rosemary had been working for hours already! The farm has many animals, and Hilary helped in the ice-cream shop. 

She bottled milk and made ice cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped feed the calves. Milking the cows took a long time, and Hilary felt lonely without children around. 

Hilary learned that farming is hard work. It is not as easy as it seems, and farmers have to work every day. 

These four people learned a lot by swapping lives for a day!"
CAE_6,"A trumpet is not just for Christmas. Many musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a special trumpet player from southern Sweden. He is 30 years old and is known all over the world. He plays old music and new music. When you see him, he looks young and happy, just like the sound of his trumpet.

When Hakan was eight years old, his father gave him a trumpet for Christmas. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music, so he bought a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved the trumpet and played it all the time. His mother found a trumpet teacher for him. The teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw that Hakan had talent. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher.

Hardenberger says that the trumpet is not a perfect instrument. Every trumpet has some mistakes. He learned to understand these mistakes and work with them. Even when he was a boy, people could recognize his special sound.

Unlike another famous trumpet player, John Wallace, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired a French trumpet player named Maurice Andre and wanted to be like him. Hakan's parents supported his dream to play the trumpet.

At 15, Hakan needed to choose where to study. He could not go to America, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not for him. Hakan knew he played better than many other young players. 

When he was 17, he entered a competition in Paris. He only prepared some pieces but made it to the second round. In the final round, he faced a hard piece. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing. He realized that people listened to him, even if he thought he played badly.

Hardenberger is honest about his music. He does not want to explain his special talent because he believes it might change it. He thinks music has the power to move people."

CAE_45,"**Career Power: Be a Good Leader**

A. What is a good leader? A good leader is someone who inspires others. They help people and show them the way. Being a leader is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about work, says that a leader makes things happen with the help of enthusiastic people. A good leader speaks clearly and confidently. They say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says that many people can be good leaders. We all have the ability to lead; we just need the right situation to grow. It is easy to see great leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, but it can be hard to see leadership in our own jobs. However, being a good leader is very important for good management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. Both may have done their jobs well, but how did they do it? The best boss motivated you and helped you. The worst boss made you feel small and blamed you when things went wrong. The first boss led well; the second boss did not.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within rules. Leaders create new ideas. A good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a sad company into a happy one.

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can be a better leader. Here are some tips:
- Leadership is best when you want to do it. Find what you care about and use that energy to lead.
- Think of yourself as a leader. You have the power to lead.
- Sometimes you need to lead strongly. Try different ways of leading. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try making decisions yourself. See how this changes things.
- Set goals and try to reach them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you.

F. Leadership does not just happen. You need to take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to share tasks, motivate others, and give praise. 
- Don’t think everyone will like your way of leading right away. Keep working on how you communicate. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas should be good.
- Be present and available for important people. 
- Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when you can help others become leaders."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent movies.**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a movie called Abyss. It is a tense story about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters are brave and funny, reminding us of heroes in other movies. The special effects are very good, but the dialogue and characters are not great. The story feels like a simple B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on a book about the battle for Guadalcanal. It is directed by Andrew Marton. This version is different from another film by Terrence Malick. Marton’s movie is more like a traditional war film. It focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick’s film is more artistic, but Marton’s version has some good moments, like when the soldier dreams of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
This movie is based on a book from 1875. It is a fun swashbuckler story about musketeers. The villain is played by Fabrice Luchini, who is a bad politician. Vincent Perez is the hero, and Daniel Auteuil plays a swordsman. The film is funny and entertaining, even with some old clichés.

**D. Character**  
This movie is set in Rotterdam a long time ago. The costumes and details make it look very old-fashioned. Jan Decleir plays a cruel bailiff named Dreverhaven. He has a bad relationship with his son. The film focuses on this relationship, but it spends too much time on the details.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This movie is being re-released. It shows the director Leone's skills very well. The sound is great, and you can hear everything clearly. The story is harsh, and the characters, played by Clint Eastwood, Lee van Cleef, and Ell Wallach, are all not very good people. They are all bad in their own way.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This is a long war movie with many famous actors. It has four directors and many extras. The beginning of the movie is slow, as soldiers wait for news about an invasion. It is impressive in some ways, but it is better to watch on a big screen. Watching it on video is not as good."

Last Christmas, Georgina turned 37. She thought she needed to start her journalism career again. She looked at her resume and saw it was old-fashioned. She used to type on a typewriter, and now computers were everywhere. She felt scared to use a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for skills in desktop publishing, but she did not have these skills. She thought it would be easier to learn about nuclear physics than to use a computer.

Georgina thought it would be hard to leave home to work. But then, she won a computer in a local newspaper contest. Her family got a laptop for her husband and a personal computer for everyone. They started to learn about the Internet and how to chat with people online. The children stopped watching TV and helped Georgina set up a small office in the kitchen. She had a phone, a fax machine, and a modem to connect to the Internet. This helped her work from home and take the kids to school.

The children were good with computers, but Georgina was nervous. She thought she would lose her work if she pressed the wrong button. But she learned the basic skills. It was easier than she thought. She started writing articles for a magazine and felt happy to work from home.

The computer helped Georgina stay organized. Before, her desk was messy, and she lost important papers. Now, she uses spreadsheets to keep track of money and saves time with ready-made invoices. The Internet helps her find information for her stories and talk to other journalists.

The museum has many interesting things to see. It tells stories about Scotland's history. There are important items, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. The museum wants to show the truth about the past, not just what people imagine.

Dr. David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He wants everyone to enjoy their visit, even if they do not know much about history. The museum has many displays with explanations and pictures. There are also computers to help visitors learn more.

Inside the museum, there are many different rooms. Each room is a different size and shape. The walls look like big stones, and there is a lot of light coming in from the windows. Visitors can take their time to look at everything.

There is a special area for children called the Discovery Centre. A group of kids helped create this space. They wanted to have fun and learn at the same time. The top floor has a gallery that changes every three years. It shows items that are important to Scottish people, like electric guitars and toys.

CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print may take some time. Change can be scary for some people. But change also means moving from one place to another. For newspapers, this change is going online. This is not easy. Many people think it will happen, but it is not clear how. 

Print newspaper sales are going down. More people are visiting newspaper websites. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen sales drop by 8% to 10%. But their websites are getting more visitors. 

A survey shows that last year, the number of newspapers sold around the world went up by 1.1%. In the West, sales went down, but in Asia, they went up. Some magazines also did well, with a 5.4% increase in sales. 

E-readers like Kindle are very popular now. But when bookstores looked at their sales of physical books, they found that sales only went down by 0.4%. This means people still buy both types of books. 

Many young people still read newspapers. In fact, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main newspapers in the UK. Different countries have different stories. In Britain, sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, it was only 7%. In France, it was 3.1%. 

In the past, people thought online ads would help newspapers. But now, online ads are going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to get readers is to offer both print and online access together. 

Print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. They make much more money from print ads than from online ads. But it is hard for newspapers to keep both print and online versions. They need to work hard to be seen online.'"
CAE_32,"**Taking Pictures of People**

People are very interesting to photograph. A picture with a person is usually better than one without. But taking good pictures of people can be hard. You need to think about how they move, their faces, and their feelings. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking pictures of a group, do not make them stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and heights. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all their faces.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. You can suggest they put their hands in their pockets or fold them.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel shy. You may need to help them feel comfortable.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture looks better if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They do not have to smile. If they look away, remind them to look at the camera again. You can also say something funny to get a real smile.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the picture. This can make the picture feel more natural. Candid shots can show real feelings.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
The way a person looks and moves tells us a lot about them. A happy child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for different expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up.

**G. Situation Interest**  
The background of a picture can add more meaning. Make sure the background does not take attention away from the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger than the background.

**H. Interaction**  
Good pictures can happen when people are talking, laughing, or working together. Look for moments when people connect, like a handshake or a smile.

**I. People and Places**  
Many pictures of people are taken on trips. To show both the person and the place, step back to get everything in the frame. Make sure the people are close to the camera but not blocking the background.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Think about why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose nicely. But for family pictures, candid shots of fun moments are often better than stiff poses. A spontaneous picture can bring back good memories later."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist. She makes special paintings called trompe-l'oeil. These paintings look real, but they are not. Joanna Watt interviews her.

Sarah does not like to sign her paintings. She thinks the painting is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is shy and does not like to talk about herself. When Joanna asks to take her picture, Sarah covers her face.

After a while, Sarah feels better. The interview becomes fun and interesting. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She learned to draw at art school and worked at a publishing house. But she wanted to do something different. She worked with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to make one trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it. She started her own work, not knowing what would happen, but she felt good about it.

Sarah is very good at observing details. She says, ""People ask me where to learn trompe-l'oeil, but no one can teach you. It's all about observation."" She is still learning and says, ""If you think you know everything, you should stop.""

Sarah is honest about her mistakes. She says, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" Once, she had to measure a big ceiling for a castle. She got confused and thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?""

Sarah often talks about herself in a funny way. She says, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'"" Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special. Many people want her work in their homes and businesses.

Some of her paintings are inspired by buildings. For example, she made a trompe-l'oeil dining room that looks like a beautiful Italian building. She also painted a hallway that looks like it has two more rooms.

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must do two things. First, it must trick you. Second, it must keep your attention and make you think. She believes that her work should also be personal for her clients. She enjoys talking to them and getting their ideas. Many of her clients become her friends.

Sarah is thankful for her clients. She says, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, and that is why she is always busy. She does not like to talk about herself too much. She says, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" 

Sarah's work is quiet and beautiful. You can never get bored with her or her paintings. They deserve to be known by more people."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman talks about important skills for success at work.

A. The rules for work are changing. Now, we are not only judged by how smart we are or what we know. We are also judged by how we manage ourselves and how we work with others. This is important when companies decide who to hire or promote. These new rules help show who will do well at work and who may not. They focus on skills that are important for getting jobs in the future. Doing well in school is not enough anymore. We need to have good social skills and personal qualities, like being friendly and understanding others. This is called emotional intelligence.

B. Today, many jobs do not offer security. Instead of having one job, we need to have skills we can use in different jobs. Personal qualities are very important at work. Emotional intelligence means being aware of our own feelings and the feelings of others. It helps us think and act better. It includes being aware of ourselves, controlling our feelings, being motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means being nice. But sometimes, it means being honest, even if it is hard. It is not about showing all our feelings. It is about managing our feelings so we can work well with others.

C. More companies are realizing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. In jobs that are not simple, emotional intelligence is even more important. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard for them to use their knowledge. Many people have succeeded without strong emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s work environment, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job.

D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people get better at managing their feelings and understanding others over time. This growth is called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and use these skills to help us in our jobs. This is important now, as jobs are less stable. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if we ignore it, other things may not work well."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Can the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones help people take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how we see these pictures. Now, some journalists look at social media for images when news happens quickly. But some reporters use pictures from users without asking. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without asking if it is very important. But people still talk about if this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people will take pictures or videos of news events. This means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the media in the future. However, the media should make sure that people get credit and payment for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is a type of medicine from China. It is over 2,000 years old. Acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine. This medicine also includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Many doctors in the West use acupuncture to help with pain.

**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**

In traditional Chinese medicine, health means that the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. There is energy in the body called Qi (pronounced ""chee""). This energy moves along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to organs in the body. If the Qi is blocked or weak, a person can feel sick or weak.

When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check your pulse, look at your tongue, and ask about your health. They will use very thin needles to help the Qi flow better. Sometimes, they use heat from herbs or pressure on certain points.

**Acupuncture Points**

There are over 300 points on the meridians where acupuncturists can place needles. These points may not be close to where you feel pain. People often feel a gentle ache or tingling when the needle is used. This means the needle is working.

**How Does Acupuncture Work?**

Doctors in the West believe acupuncture can help with pain. They think it can block pain signals to the brain or release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.

**What Pain Can Acupuncture Help?**

Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture. It can help with back pain, headaches, arthritis, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain and pain from serious illnesses.

**Using Acupuncture in Surgery**

Acupuncture has been used in China for a long time, but using it during surgery started in the 1950s. In China, acupuncture is used in many types of surgery. Some people say it helps reduce pain without side effects from regular anesthesia.

**Is Acupuncture Effective?**

Studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helps with chronic pain. It may take six to seven visits to feel better, but some people feel improvement after two or three visits.

**A Different Way to Treat Pain**

Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They ask many questions to understand the pain better. They want to know if the pain feels sharp or dull and if it gets worse in different weather. This helps them decide how to treat the pain.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. They should refer you to a doctor if you need more help."
CAE_35,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her real name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She looks calm and strong, but she is shy. She writes detective stories with many surprises. Her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is like her. He likes to solve crimes alone, just like she does.

CAE_5,"**Simplified Text:**

The pen is stronger than the doctor. People are studying handwriting to learn about a person's character. In some countries, if you want a job, you may need to show your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job.

Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Some researchers say it can help find certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer. It can also show how a person feels. Many companies now use handwriting analysis to help choose workers.

However, many doctors do not believe in graphology. Patricia Marne is a graphologist who has worked for over 20 years. She thinks handwriting can show important things about a person, like their social class and intelligence. She says it can help understand if someone is good at art or science and if they are honest or not.

Ms. Marne believes handwriting can also help find out if someone might commit a crime. She says that criminals often have bad handwriting. This can show they have problems in their life. 

She can tell if someone is honest or not just by looking at their handwriting. For example, young male offenders often have tall letters, which means they dream a lot. Handwriting can also show if someone is very stressed or has mental health issues.

Ms. Marne says that handwriting can change when someone is upset. If a person's signature changes over time, it might mean something serious is happening in their life.

She also says that different handwriting styles can show different traits. For example, if letters are connected like threads, the person might be clever but not honest. If someone writes mostly in capital letters, they may be hiding their true self. Light pressure in writing can mean the person is sensitive.

Ms. Marne believes it takes a long time to learn how to analyze handwriting well. She thinks more studies are needed to prove graphology is a real science. She believes it can be more accurate than asking people questions because it shows their true feelings without them lying.

But many doctors do not agree. They say handwriting is just about how a person was taught to write and does not mean anything else."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Good?**

A new survey says fresh air and good chairs are important for happy workers. We looked at four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here is what they said.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple. It has no heating and no fans. The windows open to the street. The workers are happy and work well together. They change the temperature by opening doors or using heaters, like at home.
  
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture does not match. Some chairs are old and broken. But the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This helps them not feel tired or bored.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The workers like the variety of their tasks. They say the office is ""just the right size."" It is small enough to know each other but big enough to work alone. The office is fun and creative.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air is good because there is no smoking.

- **Ergonomist:** The chairs and lights are good. The space is okay, but the walls are plain and grey.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls have only a few things on them. Most workers have been there for a long time and get along well. The office could be better if the desks helped people share information.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office feels like a glass box. The air is okay, even with smokers around.

- **Ergonomist:** The desks are not very good. Some chairs are not right for working on computers. The computer screens are too low.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The workers help each other and use technology well. The office is busy, but the colors are dark.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not good. The air conditioning does not work well, and it is very dusty. There is not enough space for everyone.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is old and not good for working. Many chairs do not help people who are shorter.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is dirty and needs cleaning. Workers seem stressed and do not talk much. The company should help workers work together better."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular in America. People chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. It is a small food with less than ten calories. The American Food and Drug Administration makes rules for it.

Today, most gum is made with chemicals. It has added ingredients to keep the taste and make it soft. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a natural gum from a tree called the mastic tree. Women in Greece used it to clean their teeth and make their breath fresh.

In America, colonists learned to chew gum from the Native Americans. They chewed a resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people sold spruce gum in the eastern United States. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with a substance called chicle. Chicle comes from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and better to chew. This created a big business. However, it is hard to find chicle now. 

Today, many gum makers use synthetic materials instead of chicle. The few people who still gather chicle, called chicleros, have a tough life. They walk for miles in hot and humid weather to collect the sap. They face dangers like snakes and insects. Chicleros climb trees to collect the sap and carry it back to camp. At camp, they boil the sap to make it sticky and form it into bricks.

Life at the camp is hard. Chicleros eat a simple diet and drink local alcohol. Even though their work is difficult, chicleros worry about their jobs. In the past, the United States imported a lot of chicle, but now there is much less.

As gum sales have increased, companies use synthetic materials to save money. Gum makers also find new ways to sell their products. They say gum can help you relax and reduce tooth decay. Chewing gum can help your mouth produce more saliva, which is good for your teeth.

Gum makers are always looking for new flavors and textures. They use glycerine and vegetable oils to make gum. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the most popular chewing gums."

Doug Scott is a mountaineer. He climbed the highest mountains on each continent. This is called the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life. Here are his climbs:

A. **Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his friend Dougal were in a snow cave. They were very close to the top. Dougal talked about sleeping bags, which was strange because they were alone. Doug felt cold and worried about his feet. He thought about other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. But he felt calm because Dougal was with him. Doug found a good way to climb and reached the top.

B. **Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal went to the Kahiltna Glacier. They carried food and equipment for four days. They realized the climb was hard. They followed a path but then chose a new way to the top. They carried everything on their backs. After three days, they were very tired but finally reached the summit and felt happy.

C. **Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul flew to Nairobi. They wanted to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up climbing Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle and had trouble finding water. On the second day, they found a rock pool and felt relieved. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the top.

D. **Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife Sharu went to Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who invited them to climb a different route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The wind was strong, but they reached the top and camped outside. They met other climbers who wanted to do the Seven Summits too.

E. **Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that he could climb Vinson Massif by guiding others. In November 1992, he and his team traveled to the South Pole. The sun was always shining. On December 7, they climbed to the top in very cold and windy weather. They were happy but could not see much because of the storm.

F. **Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team met in St Petersburg. They took a cable car up Elbrus. After two days, they climbed in strong winds. They thought they reached the top but found there was more to climb. They returned to their camp and then went down the mountain.

G. **Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On this climb, Doug wanted to spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about dangers but still started their journey. On May 12, they climbed and the weather got better. Doug and his team reached the top by 11 am. Doug felt proud to complete his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

FCE_24,"**Artist Susan Shepherd and Her Garden**

Susan Shepherd is an artist. She is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is very big and has many flowers. She loves tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. 

There are two long flower beds along a path in the garden. The colors and shapes of the flowers are very nice. The people who lived in the house before Susan were good gardeners. They left many plants that Susan likes. Susan also has a gardener named Danny. She says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She does not paint the whole garden at once. She takes a flower to her studio and paints it. This can take a few days. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. 

Spring and early summer are her busy times. This is when the tulips and poppies bloom. Susan loves to see how flowers change. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they may seem boring, but they become interesting.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She liked wild flowers that grew in tough places, like rocks and cliffs.

Now, her garden has many plants from different countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play. 

She is busy preparing for two art shows, so she has hired another gardener. Even though she needs to paint, she knows it is important to work in the garden too. She says, ""You have to get your hands dirty."""

In March, strong storms hit the Brackham area. Many trees fell down, including two big lime trees in the town square. This made some people in the town unhappy. One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who was the head of the local police. But during the storm, he was very sick with bronchitis. 

His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he did not want to go. He thought the police needed him. He tried to work, but he felt worse. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. After that, he got medicine and went home to rest.

On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the storm. He was too sick to understand. Later, when he felt better, he saw that the living room looked different without the walnut tree. 

Their house was big and had a nice garden. The garden made them feel private. Before, the walnut tree blocked the view of the tall house next door. Now, the tall house was visible, and it did not look nice. It had purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

Pelham said to Molly, ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" But Molly was happy. She said, ""I told you we need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We lived in our valley for sixteen months. One day, we saw that the hills around us could be dangerous. It was a year when storms came early, before winter. Until then, we felt safe in our valley. 

Then, snow began to fall. In one day, there was 15 centimeters of snow. It blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery. In the hills, the snow was deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we felt only some wind. The trees moved, but they did not break. 

We were worried about the river, the Ryburn. It usually flowed gently, but now it was dangerous. Many years ago, people built dams to control the water from the hills. 

Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds over the hills. The clouds looked scary and warned us of trouble. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The rain was coming down, and the reservoir in the hills was filling up. 

Then, the reservoir overflowed for the first time in years. Water rushed over the dam like a waterfall. The river became wild and deep near our home. For three days, we hoped the river would not flood. Luckily, the dam held, and the water went down. 

In the past, the river had flooded nearby villages. Now, the dam keeps the river safe. Most of the time, we do not worry. We can enjoy the clouds and the power of the river. Thanks to the dam, we feel safe in our valley home."

He wanted a group of critics to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have lunch together each week to talk about what to write. Mark felt very happy to be part of a new newspaper. He thought it was amazing that a new paper could start in a busy market. 

The first time Mark saw someone reading his review in the newspaper, he felt shy. Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, so they talked by phone instead. People liked to read reviews from critics who focused on one subject. Mark chose to write about films. 

Now, he writes a long piece each week about one film. He likes this way of working. He does not want to write about every film that comes out. That would make him tired of his job. He enjoys having space to write his thoughts. 

Mark thinks people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. He believes that a film review is not just a guide for buying tickets. He does not feel he must always be right about a movie. He does not think there should be a set number of good or bad films each year. His job is to share his opinion, not to judge films."
FCE_46,"**Why does a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because it is fun!**

Melanie is a teenager who loves sports. She is looking for a training partner who also loves to swim, cycle, and run. They should be very interested in running long distances, swimming in cold water, and cycling long distances. They need to do all three sports without taking a break.

The triathlon is a popular sport in the Olympics. Many people watch athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and run 10km without stopping. It looks hard, but Melanie thinks it is fun. She started doing triathlons when she was 14 years old. 

In her first triathlon, she won because she was the only junior there. She felt confident and joined the National Championships. She swam fast and ran fast, but she got lost and cycled too far. She cried while running but did not give up. She wants to keep trying.

Steve Trew, a coach, admires her hard work. He says she works very hard and does not stop when she is tired. This year, she was the best junior in the European Triathlon Championships and finished 13th. She is working hard to get better at cycling.

Melanie wants her parents to buy her a new bike for the World Championships in New Zealand. It costs a lot of money. She trains a lot and does not have much time for friends. She says, ""I don’t have a social life."" After swimming for two hours, she just wants to sleep. But she still talks to her teammates about their training times.

Melanie has tried shorter triathlons, but she wants to do even harder events. She says, ""I have no one my age to train with."""
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about collecting things and why many people like this hobby. Many adults enjoy collecting. It is a fun and exciting world. But if you want to collect something, remember: you should love the item. 

People have collected things for a long time. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.

I have collected things all my life. I started with stones from my parents' garden when I was six years old. I went to a school in a cold place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a museum. The museum had many interesting objects collected by people long ago. I loved looking at them.

Many adults also like to collect. Some people collect because it is something they can control. For me, I just enjoy it. 

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful things. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings. But you do not need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I got a special tulip from another collector. I planted it, but one year it disappeared. Someone stole it!

I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I looked all over the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was lost in a fire. The next day, I saw the burned remains of my dolls and furniture. I felt very sad.

I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king is very valuable. When small items become popular, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you kept the original boxes. I threw mine away!"
FCE_3,"**My Work**

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Organiser at the Science Museum**  
I make exhibitions at the museum. I plan and design them. I read about the topic and talk to important people to find out what to show. I want the public to understand the exhibition. I plan fun activities like workshops and shows. I also work with engineers to make sure everything is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help make brochures to tell people about it.

**Janet - Teacher for London Taxi Drivers**  
I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps we need for the taxi-driver test. By noon, about 50 students are in class, learning the best routes to take. I help when they disagree about directions. Before their test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different way because the road is closed. This helps them think of new routes.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the sea and work from home. I answer phone calls, make educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but I mostly work by the coast. I work with schools and teach people about the sea. I take them on a boat to show them the life under the water. This helps them understand better. I love my job because I care about conservation, but I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money to do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is different every day. I make sure we have enough books and that they are good quality. We get many letters from readers about maps, and I need to answer them carefully. I talk about new projects and sales with my team. I enjoy working with my team, but I have a lot of paperwork to do, which takes time away from more fun tasks like designing new products."
FCE_10,"**Title: Our Trip to Ireland**

Every June, we go to Ireland. The four of us always stay at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim for two weeks. It is a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, own the house. They made it bigger, but it still looks nice.

Strafe found Glencorn Lodge for us. He saw an ad when the Malseeds were looking for guests. Last summer, we went to a hotel that friends told us about, but we did not like it because the food was bad. 

The four of us are good friends. My name is Dorothy Milson, but my friends call me Milly. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were school friends. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. 

Mrs. Malseed always welcomes us with a smile. She seems to know when we arrive. She waits in the hall that smells like flowers. She tells the porter, Arthur, to take our bags to our rooms. Our rooms are named after flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of numbers. In winter, she takes care of small things, while Mr. Malseed fixes and paints the house.

Mr. Malseed greets us with a big smile and says, ""A hundred thousand welcomes!"" We feel happy to be back. Kitty from the dining room also greets us and says we look younger every year, which makes everyone laugh.

After dinner, we play cards, but we are tired from our trip. In the lounge, there is a man alone and a French couple. Many people are at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is full in June. From our window, we see some guests walking on the lawn and others going to the beach.

In the morning, we will walk on the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at a hotel there. We will be back for lunch. In the afternoon, we will drive somewhere. We love this place and its beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex, England. Sarah works in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She finished her studies in French and History of Art last summer. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a long-term job, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two. She meets many interesting people.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. The guests eat porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.

After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She does not like cleaning the rooms. By 11 a.m., she goes skiing. On good days, she skis until 4:30 p.m.

Sarah comes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like a messy kitchen in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but sometimes they want to be alone.

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually go to a place called Bananas and then to G Jay's or Dick's T-Bar. But on Saturday nights, she goes home early because Sunday is her busiest day.

On Sunday, Sarah wakes up early. She makes breakfast for guests who are leaving at 7 a.m. After they leave, she cleans the chalet quickly. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. 

At about 3 p.m., Sarah prepares tea for the new guests who arrive at 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions. 

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. Then she goes back to the chalet. After dinner, she might have a drink, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen is a small girl. She looks younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she says she is six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore big shoes and overalls, and her hair was messy but pretty. It was hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research about leather in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

Sometimes, students call or write to Seymour to visit his factory. He helps them by answering questions or giving a short tour if they seem serious. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class who visited the factory years ago. Seymour showed them how to make gloves. He remembered how Marie loved the ""pancake hands,"" which were hot and shiny brass hands used to shape the gloves.

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked more questions. He liked that she was interested. He explained that the leather comes to the tannery, where they make it ready to use. Seymour's family worked in the tannery, and he worked there for six months too. 

Rita said she had never been to a tannery. Seymour told her she should go if she wants to write about leather. He offered to help her visit one. He said it was hard work but very interesting. He mentioned that the leather industry is very old, with some tools found in Turkey that are 6,000 years old.

Seymour said his father knows a lot about leather. If you talk to him about gloves, he can talk for two days. He asked Rita if she had ever seen anything being made. She said she saw her mother make a cake when she was a child. Seymour laughed because she was eager to learn.

Rita reminded him of Marie, who was much taller but had the same bright spirit. Seymour decided to show Rita how to make gloves. He said, ""We will make you a pair of gloves. What size do you wear?"""
FCE_71,"**Is It a Hard Job?**

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as good as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles. Raquel is a personal assistant to a pop star. She loves her job but has one problem: she does not like flying. ""On a long trip to California, I take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde. ""It felt very small with tiny windows."" When she is not flying, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does paperwork, organizes schedules, and attends meetings. Raquel did not apply for this job. She met a pop group manager by chance and took a secretarial course at night. Five years later, she became a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy. He likes being a caddy more because he loves golf. But there are some problems. He earns a small fee and a part of the winnings. He makes between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You do more than carry bags. You give advice and read the course,"" he says. Now, he works for European Tour Productions. He collects and analyzes golf statistics from caddies. Many people want this information, including TV commentators and golfers.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper. One of his easy tasks is to try food in nice restaurants. He thinks expensive restaurants are okay for people who can pay. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave,"" he says. He started writing a food column because a friend asked him. At that time, he worked in advertising. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant less money, but it was a chance to do what I love,"" he says. He still cooks at home and rides his bike to stay fit.

**D. Dick Prince**  
Dick Prince is a popular children's writer. ""I started writing stories for kids 20 years ago,"" he says. Before that, he liked words but mostly wrote poems. He got an idea for a story about chickens and a fox. This story, called The Fox Busters, was his first published children's book. Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy. I work hard on them,"" he says. He writes in the morning and types in the afternoon on an old typewriter. He gets many letters each week and enjoys answering them. Now, he has some help with this."
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story building. Outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust. One afternoon, Michael and his friends went to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge and looked at the lake. 

Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down!"" He jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust. He laughed and said, ""I dare you all! You're all cowards!"" His friends looked scared but then one by one, they jumped down too. They all laughed and lay on the sawdust, telling jokes.

After a while, one friend said, ""Let’s go back up and jump again."" They were not very excited, but they went back to the roof. They jumped down, but Michael stayed on the roof. His friends called, ""Come on, Mike! What’s wrong?"" 

Michael wanted to jump, but he felt scared. He tried to count to ten and take a deep breath, but he could not jump. His friends laughed at him and said, ""You’re a coward! We can’t wait all night!"" When he did not jump, they started to leave.

Michael felt sad and alone. He looked at the ground for a long time. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 

When he got up, he felt ashamed and walked home slowly. He was late for dinner. His stepmother said, ""You should be home on time. If you can’t come home, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She looked serious, but Michael did not really hear her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change it but don’t know how? Kitty Doherty has some good advice for you. Many people who want a new job go to a careers adviser. 

First, you will write a short history about yourself. Then, you will take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will get a summary of the results. The adviser will suggest different jobs for you and tell you if you need more training.

I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. Taking the test felt like being in a school exam. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I had to remember that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard. They included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. 

After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was sad to learn that I did not do well in the science and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse! But it was good to hear that I made the right choice in journalism.

Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. She said, ""Losing my job was a good chance to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. She did not know she was good at design. But she had to think about the cost of training for design.

Donna also got other ideas, like taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her skills and work in a job that suited her better. Now, she is a Public Relations officer. She thinks she could have found this job without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she wanted to do. She has sent many friends there, and they are all happy.

Some people really need help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services after working at a bank for six years. She said, ""My job was boring, and I wanted a new challenge. I did not know what to do, so I went to the adviser with an open mind."" The tests showed she liked sciences. She had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the last meeting, she decided to study geology. She thinks the advice was worth the money. Now, she is happier.

But not everyone finds careers advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, 24, was a sales representative. She said, ""I did not know where to go in my career. I thought a careers adviser could help me. I got many new ideas, but I did not like them because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of training. I did not learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had told a friend her problems, they would have given her the same advice."
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a nice blue couch. Patients sit on the couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Many people only go to the dentist when they are in pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make people feel safe and happy. He does not wear a white coat because many people think white coats mean pain. He believes dental visits should be relaxing and fun.

Jerome uses new ideas to help people relax. One idea is virtual-reality headsets. His office was the first in Britain to use them. Patients wear the headsets during their check-up. They can watch a movie about underwater animals while Jerome looks at their teeth. Then, the headset shows them a video of their mouth. Many patients like this part of their visit.

The office smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today it smells like orange. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. The smell of a dentist can make people scared. I thought the nice smell in the office was very good.

Jerome is known as a stylish dentist, but he takes his work seriously. The ways to help people relax are important, but good treatment is the most important. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a little strange, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn new dental techniques. He found that when you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for the dentist too. He wants to change the way dentists work in Britain to be less formal.

One day, a patient comes in. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers him tea, and asks what video he wants to watch. He leads the patient to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a nice beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,"**Chocolate and Its History**

Chocolate comes from South America. Now, it is a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend a lot of money on chocolate, especially at Easter. They buy more chocolate at Easter than at any other time, except Christmas.

A long time ago, the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans grew cacao plants. These plants are found in warm places like Africa and South America. The cacao tree has big fruit with seeds inside. When the seeds are dried, they are called cacao beans. In English, they are often called cocoa beans. 

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water."" This drink was special and used for ceremonies. The Spanish liked to add sugar and cinnamon to the drink. 

In the late 1600s, people in Europe started to drink chocolate in special places called chocolate houses. At first, people made the drink from solid chocolate. In 1826, a man named CJ van Houten made chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate drinks.

In 1847, a company in Bristol made the first chocolate bar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate. 

In the late 1800s, French companies sold a lot of chocolate in Britain. But then, Cadbury made the Dairy Milk bar in 1905. This chocolate bar became very popular because it was linked to healthy milk.

Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies are trying new ideas to sell more chocolate, like making chocolate ice cream or drinks.

However, cacao farmers have problems because the price of cocoa beans went down in the 1980s. Many small farmers had to stop working. So, when you eat chocolate, remember the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke is 83 years old. He is very good at making art. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he is happy making beautiful things from shells. 

Peter shows me his work in his home. He asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring. He is interesting and his art is beautiful. He shows me some shell decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I don’t mind if people don’t buy them. I love them."" Peter never planned to sell his art. Five years ago, some friends told him to have an exhibition. They said, ""People should see your work."" They helped him talk to a gallery owner.

His first exhibition was in London. 70% of his art was sold. His second exhibition started yesterday. The prices for his art are high. Some pieces cost around £2,000. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition. The cheapest piece is £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he does not set the prices. He believes his work is special. The gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop making art, and everyone will want your pieces.""

Peter wishes he had started making art earlier. He thinks he could have made even better things. Now, he feels a bit limited because he is older. But his work is very different from the common shell art you see in shops. He has a ""miniature mind,"" which means he makes small and detailed art. He creates boxes with tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of beautiful flowers.

Peter uses different materials for his art. He uses cardboard from shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He has a clear idea of what he wants to make, and he works hard to make it happen. 

Peter travels to many places to find beautiful shells. He has been to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He looks for shells on the beach. He only collects dead shells and does not take shells with living creatures. He believes that many people walk on the shells and break them. He thinks it is okay to collect shells that are already empty. 

Peter’s art is very beautiful, and he loves making it."

Now, Kira has two lives: school and modeling. Her friends and teachers are proud of her. But some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too much of herself. Kira feels sad about this. She says, ""I am still the same person. I am just more confident.""

Being a model is busy. The agency can call her anytime for a job. Kira cannot always make plans with her friends. But her friends understand. They do not complain about her work.

Kira has a bright future as a model. She is successful even before finishing school. When Jane asks Kira what she would do if she was not a model, Kira says, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Search for Gold

Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son. They have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain has a lot of gold, maybe 10,000 ounces. After ten years of digging, they believe they are very close to finding gold worth five million dollars.

Terence, who is 68 years old and from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find a lot of gold. We just need to dig a little more."" They have worked hard to find gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold in an area called the ""Dolgellau gold belt"" near a town named Dolgellau. They looked at old mining books and chose a good place to dig.

They cleared the land, found some gold in the rocks, and spent ten years getting permission to work. They took samples of the earth and removed old cars and trash. They dug out a lot of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter deep hole. Now, they need more money. They spent their savings and need to find someone to give them £50,000 to dig deeper for the gold.

Chris said it is hard to find a backer, but they have some people to contact. Last week, news about their dig spread, and people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau needs tourists, and some residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, who manages the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, it could bring more people here, but I hope many people do not come and damage the hillside.""

The gold industry in Wales has become smaller since the late 1880s when many people worked in mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, closed a month ago. Now, more individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, wants to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. He is 70 years old and said, ""Searching for gold is very exciting. It feels like an adventure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She studies the ocean. Rachel works at Southampton University. She teaches and does research about the sea. 

When she is not teaching, Rachel goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is like a small car. It goes deep into the Atlantic Ocean, three kilometres down. Rachel studies underwater volcanoes in this vehicle. 

Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rocks and water, and three hours to come back up. 

If there is a problem, Rachel can press a panic button. This button makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. Rachel says it might not be a nice trip.

The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. An instructor was with her. He told her what to do in an emergency. Now, Rachel has gone on six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place in the ocean with many underwater volcanoes. 

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research about ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. They release hot water that looks like black smoke. 

Once, Rachel was scared when she dived with American scientists. They were using equipment when there was a loud explosion. Rachel thought she would die. But they were safe, and she felt very relieved.

Diving to the bottom of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. She feels amazed when she sees the volcanoes. She studied them for three years. When she finally saw them, it was an incredible feeling."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, and hungry after my trip. It was the end of my holiday in Europe. I felt tired and confused by all the different trains, money, and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year and the year after that.

I could buy a train ticket and travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month because I was under twenty-five years old. Sleeping on a train is different from sleeping in a bed. I carried my things in a big bag on my back. This made me travel simply and sometimes wastefully. I even burned my old socks and got rid of books I finished reading. 

But this way of traveling is fun. With a ticket in my hand, I felt free. My friends and I did not know how special this ticket was at first. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in France. But we wanted to see more countries. The extra travel did not cost us anything.

This was my first holiday without my parents. We made our own plans and only saw the things that were easy to find. I was proud that sometimes I only looked at the view from the train station. We just wanted to enjoy our time together. 

Traveling is exciting because you see places you only heard about before. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. You can understand Europe better by seeing it yourself. Other people's holiday photos can be boring because they do not show the real experience. The train trip may not show you new things in the world, but it is a special experience for you. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see this, even if it takes time to understand."
FCE_37,"Text: 

It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your bags are not there. You may have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you may be in a very different place and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather.

Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes. It is hard for any airline to promise that your checked bags will go on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Here is how it works: Airlines want you to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for your bags to be checked and put on the plane. There is also a minimum time to change planes, which is longer than needed to help with bag transfers. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause delays. This can make it hard for bags to get to the right place. 

Human mistakes can also happen, like if the label on your bag comes off. Big airports, called 'hubs', can have more problems because they handle many bags. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, and many were changing planes. British Airways had two million passengers changing planes there.

Even good airports like Amsterdam and Singapore can have bad days. Some airports, like Miami in the United States, are known for losing bags when passengers change planes quickly.

To avoid losing your bags, try to book direct flights if you can. Check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline. Take an earlier flight to give yourself more time to change planes. Make sure to put your name and address on your bags, inside and outside. Also, write down your flight numbers.

If your bags are still missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a report before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Charlie James is a wildlife photographer. He knows a lot about the kingfisher. The kingfisher is a small bird that is blue and green. It lives near rivers and streams and eats fish. 

The kingfisher is very fast. It moves quickly through the water. When it flies, it looks like a flash of light. You can see it for just a moment, but it is very beautiful. 

Charlie loved kingfishers when he was a child. He does not know why he loves them so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. One story says that a goddess turned into a kingfisher. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its body became blue like the sky. 

Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. They look blue because of how their feathers are made. The light makes them look blue or green. 

Many photographers love to take pictures of kingfishers. They are shy, but you can watch them from a hiding place. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket. He waited quietly, and the kingfisher came close to him. 

Charlie spent a lot of time by the stream to watch kingfishers. He missed some school because he wanted to be with the birds. At 16, he started working for a nature magazine. Later, he became a wildlife film cameraman. 

Now, Charlie wants to make a special film about kingfishers. He wants to show their beauty without talking. He loves to take pictures of their wings. 

Charlie feels a strong connection to kingfishers. His photos show some of his feelings, but there is much more to his love for these birds."
FCE_68,"**Conductors and Their Work**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their jobs.

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice in Vienna. She ended up helping him because an assistant was not there. Later, she helped with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I was not nervous. I like standing in front of an orchestra,"" she says. Anne is from America. She works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries. She has helped Abbado on many projects.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting good chances to work. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying two times before. He is happy it happened when it did. ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten,"" he says. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. But he is worried about being known only for the competition. ""If in three years people still think of me as a competition winner, I will be worried,"" he says. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting him back.

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She loves the long practice time for opera. ""The music needs four weeks of work,"" she says. She began conducting in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional two years ago. Learning from Sian Edwards was important for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from bigger people,"" she says. She enjoys the complex nature of opera with its many arguments and different singers.

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. He says conducting surprised him, but he finds it very interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and tried my best,"" he says. People respect him as a musician. He learns from every experience and is open to trying new things.

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
Wayne Marshall is 32 years old. In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed him and told his agent about him. Wayne soon had to conduct a musical in London with little notice. It was a hard start. Some musicians were reading newspapers during the show. ""I was strict with them. I always gave a clear beat,"" he says. He believes many musicians do not need advice from a conductor, but he is not afraid to say what he wants. He has not studied conducting formally, but people have helped him. He is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,"**Theme Parks in Britain**

If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many in Britain. Here are five families' experiences.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US. We thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were happy! The park is good for young children. Our three-year-old had fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special ride for little kids, and they liked it a lot. For older kids, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, we were tired, but the kids wanted to stay. The park is clean and safe, but it could be more fun.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
We had never been to a theme park before, so we were excited. We thought Oscar was too young, but he loved it! He liked the Mountain Train and Little Land, where he could see small famous buildings. The older kids enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We stayed for six hours and found nice places to rest. The park is beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is fun for everyone, even adults!

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which was very exciting. We tried the Terror Line, and the girls were scared but said it was fun. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is great for younger kids. The park is clean, and the staff are helpful. One staff member even helped me with one of the girls when I couldn’t sit with both.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We got to the park at one o'clock and were sad it closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger kids because the rides are not too scary. I am scared of rides, but I had fun. We loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn’t want to try the Big Leap, but it looked fun. The kids loved it because it was perfect for their age.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we agree! The Rocket, the tallest roller-coaster in Europe, is very exciting. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down, was worse! There are many rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. Some staff were nice to the younger kids, but not all. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn’t tell the kids we were going home early!"
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside.

A. CHRISTINE HOGAN has a computer design business. She says, ""My customers are friends."" She moved from London to the countryside with her husband when their children were small. She wanted to work from home. She had worked with computers before, so her husband helped her start the business. At first, it was hard and she needed a lot of money. She was careful with her spending. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evening if she wants. Her business is small, and people come to pick up their work.

B. MAGGY SASANOW makes greeting cards. She enjoys being independent. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no jobs in the countryside. So, she started her own business and makes 50 types of greeting cards to sell to museums. She works in a big room upstairs. Sometimes, it is hard to work from home because there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She does not advertise; people hear about her work by word of mouth. She is cheaper than other artists. Working alone can be lonely, but she likes it.

C. DELIA TURNER makes curtains. She started her business eight years ago. At first, it was good, and her income grew a lot. She had six workers, but she had to let them go when business got bad. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. She has to lower her prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.

D. TESSA STRICKLAND publishes children's books from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because it is cheaper than London and she loves the country. She likes to work when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at different times. It is hard to close the office door and focus. She publishes books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. At first, she felt alone because she had worked in London before.

E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake business. She started ten years ago at home. She is interested in health, so she makes fruit cakes with good ingredients. Friends and family asked for her cakes, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building to make the cakes. Now, she has a baker and an assistant. She does not bake anymore; she manages the business. Her biggest problem has been money because she did not have a lot to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is very special. They are all musicians. The sons write music and play instruments. Their dad makes the instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins are teachers in South Wales. They have a ten-year-old son named Paul. Paul wanted a cello, but it was too expensive. John thought, ""I can make one!"" He found a school to learn how to make instruments. He took classes for three years. 

After making some violins, John made his first cello for Paul. Paul liked it very much. John made another cello later, and Paul used it for many years. Now, John makes about twelve violins each year. He even sold one to a famous American musician!

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul began with the piano. He loved to play it as soon as he could reach the keys. Later, he wanted to play the cello because he thought the cellist in his dad's group was very cool. 

Huw says their parents were very supportive. They did not push them to play music. Huw is now 22 years old and is a pianist and composer. 

Paul became very successful. He won a big music competition and played in the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played his dad's cello until last year. Now, he has a very old cello on loan from a music school. 

Paul will play on television soon, but he cannot watch it because he has a concert that night. Huw also has a concert that night. Their parents, John and Hetty, will be very busy trying to see both of their sons perform."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside**

**The National Trust**

The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the countryside in Britain. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to a warden named Gareth Roberts. He works for the Trust to take care of the beautiful land.

Gareth says a National Trust Warden needs common sense. He also needs to be good with people. He talks to farmers, visitors, and other workers every day. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm. Many people wanted to be the warden, but Gareth got the job because he knows the area well and has farming experience.

Gareth still helps on his parents' farm. This helps him understand the farmers' problems. He can also do hard work like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working for the Trust, he has learned more about nature. When he was young, he liked to pick flowers and collect butterflies. Now, he sees that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following the government’s rules.

At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted different things. Now, they are talking and trying to understand each other. Gareth says they are close to working together.

Gareth's job is to help with conservation, allow people to visit the Trust's land, plant trees, and work with tenant farmers. He wants to finish jobs quickly and without problems. He enjoys seeing projects done, but he also spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.

Gareth likes his job, but sometimes he finds it hard to deal with some visitors. Some people come in, ask for everything, and then leave without saying thank you. This can be annoying for him. But he believes that common sense is important.

If you have common sense and want to work outside, you might think about becoming a warden like Gareth. But remember, there may not be a job available in the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In this story about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra is getting ready for the World Championships next month. She teaches at a local school and then trains in a car park.

I asked Kendra if people look at her when she trains. She said, ""I focus on my movements and my feet. I don’t see much else."" Kendra is working hard to be her best for the Championships. She has a strict schedule to be fit.

This is Kendra's fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries playing. Kendra said, ""We will have support from our home crowd, which is special."" She wants to make netball better in England. There will be more pressure because people expect them to play well.

Their first game is against Barbados right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We usually win against them, but they are good players."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. ""You must play well every day. There is no rest between games. You only have one chance to win,"" she said.

In the last fifteen years, netball has become faster and harder. Kendra said, ""We train hard to win. But after the game, we are friends."" Netball is also using more science to help players get fit. Kendra believes it is important to think and train like a top player. As captain, she wants to support her team.

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition will be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. When she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

What can parents do for a child who is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents may not see their child's needs until the child gets upset or acts out. Most schools help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special help that regular schools may not provide. 

In Britain, there are five special music schools. These schools help children aged 7 to 18 who are very talented in music. At these schools, children can learn music from professional musicians. They spend a lot of time on music, like taking lessons, playing in groups, and practicing. They also study important subjects like English, math, and science, but less time is spent on these subjects compared to music.

The five music schools in Britain are independent, which means they are not run by the government. The classes are small, so teachers can give more attention to each student. Many children live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be with other children who love music too.

However, there are some problems. The schools are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for children who live there. The schools try to help families with scholarships, which are financial aids. Also, not all parents want to send their young children to live at school. The school directors worry about admitting very young children because it can be a lot of pressure. They want to help children grow up happy and well-rounded.

Sometimes, being in a special music school can be stressful. A child’s musical talent may change as they grow up. The pressure to succeed can make them feel like they are failing. The schools watch each child closely and offer help when needed. 

Many students who leave music school feel they learned a lot, but some think it is not good to focus only on music and not enough on other subjects. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more in school. 

It might be better to wait until a child is older to decide if they should go to a special music school. Children who are good at both music and school can do well in regular schools that have good music programs. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges, but this may not be possible for families who live far away from big cities."
FCE_25,"**Artist Susan Shepherd and Her Garden**

Susan Shepherd is an artist. She is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is very big and has many flowers. She loves tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. 

The garden has two long flower areas next to a path. The path goes from one side to the other. The people who lived there before Susan took care of the garden. They left many plants that Susan likes. Susan also has a gardener named Danny. She says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas. But when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She does not paint the whole garden at once. She takes a flower to her studio and paints it. This can take a few days. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. 

Spring and early summer are her busy times. This is when the tulips and poppies bloom. Susan loves to see how flowers change. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they may seem boring, but they become interesting.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She liked wild flowers that grew in hard places, like rocks.

Now, her garden has many plants from different countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play. 

She has two art shows coming up, so she is very busy. She has another gardener to help her. But she knows that to paint flowers well, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She finished university last summer. She studied French and History of Art. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a long-term job, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two. She meets many interesting people.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast first. Then she makes breakfast for the guests. They eat porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and sometimes makes afternoon tea for the guests. She does not like cleaning the rooms because it is hard work.

By 11 a.m., Sarah goes skiing. She loves to ski and can stay on the slopes until 4:30 p.m. After skiing, she goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. and usually has three courses. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like to see a messy kitchen in the morning.

Sometimes Sarah talks with the guests, but sometimes they want to be alone. Good guests make her week better. Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at night but come home early on Saturday because Sunday is a busy day.

On Sunday, Sarah starts work early. Breakfast for the guests is at 7 a.m. After breakfast, she cleans quickly. She prepares for new guests who arrive at 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests have many questions.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests get their ski boots and skis. After dinner, she may chat with friends, but if she is very tired, she goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""It was hard to choose my clothes because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. I went to a photo studio and then to meetings before lunch. The zoo is calm and quiet, but here I was busy. Some people in fashion looked stressed, but my job is not stressful. In the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean animal cages. I like seeing how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo.""

Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I wore my leather boots and dark blue pants. The zoo gave me a green shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. When I touched an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I was very dirty, but I had a great day. When I stop working in fashion, I might work with elephants in Africa.""

Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh was nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes do not see the sun. It was hard work, but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I thought gardening would be easy, but it was hard work. I will keep my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock is a gardener on Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would feel sick, but I was okay. The nurses are friendly, and it felt nice compared to my usual job with men. I think my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but I felt good about helping.""

Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I put on the uniform and felt different. People looked at me. Before the flight, our boss told us about safety. I knew some of it from my training. When the passengers got on the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone looked at me, and I felt shy. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren who were very noisy. I wished I was back in the gym with one adult.""

Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer. ""I was nervous because I do not exercise. I was surprised at how much attention trainers give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers many times a day. At lunch, I saw some trainers eat unhealthy food, but they drink a lot of water. I do not want to change jobs, but I want to join a gym and be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Train**

Five famous people share their favorite memories of train journeys.

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I love the south of France. I go there when I can. There is a train from Cannes to Italy. The views are beautiful, no matter the weather. You can see nice houses and gardens. The people on the train are happy. There are tourists and locals, all enjoying the trip.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have taken many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to Kruger National Park. I was too young and had to stay with my aunt. When I moved to England, I saw my first big train station, London Waterloo. It was amazing!

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
One special train for me is the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon in France. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I still wear it. The journey was lovely, and we took a boat on the Nile after that. It was a perfect way to relax after our wedding.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
I worked on a project about traveling around the world. We had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not good, and we only knew the day to leave. When the train came, many people got on, even on the roof! At night, we saw beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people love trains from when they are kids, but I did not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where there were few trains. I started to love trains as a teenager when I made a film in Yorkshire. We filmed on an old train line. I loved riding the steam trains. When I visited last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights at the station!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Do you want to get your story published? Margaret Stubbs can help you. Many people ask, ""I wrote a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. To sell your writing, you must know the market. 

Read a lot! Go to your local library and bookshops. This will help you understand what publishers want. Remember, things change. New magazines and books come out all the time. 

If you want to write short love stories, find magazines that publish them. Get recent copies and read them. Know what kind of stories they like and who their readers are. 

Sometimes, new writers send their stories to me and ask, ""I was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I try to be honest but positive. Many new writers send their work too soon. If you only have one story, it is hard to get published. 

When you hear about someone’s success, they usually worked in writing for a long time before that. When you send your work out, keep writing more stories. Write ten or twenty more! Each story will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. 

Don’t give up! Improve your stories instead of throwing them away. At first, don’t show your work to others. Remember, many successful writers were rejected many times before they succeeded. 

Do everything you can to be a better writer. Look for a creative writing class or join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and feel more confident. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were many more people than I thought. The station did not feel nice and clean like before. Older couples with matching bags sat on the benches, and many college kids had their bags on the floor.

A man with grey hair was walking around. He looked rich. He had nice clothes. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but not to Philadelphia. She was going to New York. The man thanked her and walked to the next bench.

I was watching him. He asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going to Wilmington. He did not say anything and walked to a couple with matching bags. I moved closer to him. I was going to Philadelphia too. I thought he could have asked me, but he did not. He looked stressed.

He asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes. He asked her for a favour. I stood a little away and looked at my wrist, even though I did not have a watch. The woman looked worried. The man said, ""It is not too difficult, I promise!""

They announced my train. People started to move to Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man was talking to the woman. He said his daughter was flying to study abroad from Philadelphia. He put her on a train and went home. When he got home, his wife was upset. She did not say ""hello."" His daughter forgot her passport and called from the station. She did not know what to do.

The woman felt sorry for him. I wanted to stay quiet and listen. The man said he told his daughter to stay at the station. He would get someone to bring her passport. I thought it was strange. Why did he not go himself if it was so important?

The woman asked, ""Why don't you go yourself?"" He said he could not leave his wife alone. She was in a wheelchair. I thought this was not a good excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family.

I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a normal envelope. It was a padded envelope, like a small book. I thought, ""Be careful, lady!"""
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore is the owner of a restaurant. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant.

When John found the restaurant, it was in bad shape, but he thought it was perfect. He remembered his childhood. His mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad when he was alone. John wanted to have time for family. His wife took care of the children and helped with the money, while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. They talked to customers from a young age.

Gary was a lively child. One time, he jumped into a bath and hurt himself. When he got older, he did small jobs for money. By age ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend and had a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and woke up early. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.

Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as good as the adult cooks and sometimes was in charge. He made over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would work in cooking. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Gary also started playing the drums and has his own band now. John told Gary to focus on one thing. He said, ""If you want to succeed, do it by age 30."" Gary went to cooking school at 17. On his first day, he finished his work very fast and helped others. 

Now, Gary has a successful TV cooking show, and John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary to work hard for what he wants because nothing is given for free. John thinks Gary listened to him because of the things Gary says and does."
FCE_7,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding a good flat in Dublin is very hard. It is like looking for gold. The best way to find a flat is to know someone. If you know a person who knows someone else, you might find a place. But Jo just came to Dublin. She did not know anyone. So, she had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat.

Jo felt scared and excited when she took the train to Dublin. She did not think about why she was going. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to go to big cities and have fun. Some of her friends went to other towns, but no one was going to Dublin. Jo was going alone.

Jo's mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because hostels can be cold. Jo's sisters worked in a hotel and thought it was crazy for her to stay in a hostel for a week. But Jo did not know they were talking about her.

Jo saw an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to her job at the post office. Jo hoped it would be nice and not too expensive. There were not many people looking at this flat. It was not just a flat for rent; they wanted a third girl to share.

Jo wondered if the flat was too fancy for her. The house looked normal, a red-brick house with two floors. The flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf came down the stairs. She looked unhappy. ""This place is bad,"" she told Jo. ""The girls are not nice.""

Jo asked, ""What happened?"" The girl said, ""She just acted like she was better than us."" Jo kept going up the stairs. 

Another girl named Nessa was there. She was friendly and said they were having tea. She had three mugs: one with her name, one with Pauline's name, and one that said ""Other."" Nessa said, ""We can put your name on a mug if you stay with us."""
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We like to see them in the sea, in movies, and on TV. But dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds tells us about this problem.

Dolphins are very smart animals. They can feel human emotions and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. We see dolphins in shows like Flipper and Seaquest. But these happy shows do not show the real life of dolphins. The seas are dirty and there are not enough fish for them to eat.

In the North Sea, the number of harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down a lot. There used to be many, but now there are many less. You might think that dolphins are protected by laws and live in safe places. This is not true. There are not enough plans to help them, and this could be a big problem for wildlife.

There are forty types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, we can find striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea. We do not see them often. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near the coasts of Europe. Bottlenose dolphins are friendly and were often seen in places like the Thames River in Britain. Now, we can only find them in a few places in Scotland and Wales. The dolphins that are still there have injuries, which show they are stressed.

It is hard to know why there are fewer dolphins. Overfishing is a big problem. When fishermen catch too many fish, dolphins cannot find food. They may not survive if they cannot find food quickly. Dolphins can also get caught in fishing nets. These nets can be hard to see. Many dolphins have died because they got caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also get sick from pollution in the sea. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies. Female dolphins can pass these poisons to their babies through their milk. There is a case of a baby dolphin that died because of this.

Another problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to communicate. But noise from ships and oil wells can disturb them. This noise travels better in water than in air, and it may affect dolphins in ways we do not understand yet."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your body and mind. It helps you feel good and stay healthy. Many people talk about fitness because it is really good for you. 

Here are some reasons to exercise:

- It makes your muscles stronger.
- It helps your body look better.
- It helps you sit and stand correctly.
- It can stop injuries.
- It makes your heart and lungs healthier.

Exercise can also help with feelings. It can make you feel less sad and tired. It helps you sleep better and can reduce stress. 

There are many types of exercise you can do, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. But be careful! If you exercise too hard, you can get hurt. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are not sure what to do.

Good posture is very important. It helps you look and feel better. If you slouch, try to imagine a balloon pulling you up. This will help you stand tall and breathe better.

Stretching is also important. It helps your body move easily and prevents injuries. Try to stretch four or five times a week to be more flexible and fit. 

A good exercise routine should include:

1. A warm-up
2. Stretching
3. An energetic workout
4. A cool down

Remember, exercise is good for you!"
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for a long time? They want to get the best pictures of animals. Amanda and Owen work in East Africa, in a place called the Ngorongoro Crater. It has rained a lot there for six months. This has caused some problems for them. Owen said they had to buy a special tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud.

Amanda and Owen make great wildlife films. One of their best films is about leopards. While people were watching this film, Amanda and Owen were already looking for another animal, the jackal. 

Film-makers travel all over the world to film animals. I talked to Owen when he was at a safari lodge with other people. He said, ""We sometimes argue, but we make up quickly."" They do not think one of them is the boss. They both see animals in the same way.

When they travel, they set up their tents every night. This time, they are staying in one place. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before. They eat pre-packed meals that they heat up. Owen said, ""We can be out for eight weeks, so cooking can be a little stressful.""

It can be hard work, but they like being in quiet places. This helps them get close to the animals. Owen remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would go away and then come back to greet her family. She even greeted their car!

Owen first worked with Amanda in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. Now, they spend four months in one place to get enough material for each film. Before they start, they must show a script to get approval.

Owen said, ""Amanda and I work well together because we have the same ideas. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts."""

In this story about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra is very busy because the World Championships are next month. She teaches at a school and then trains in a car park.

Suzie asked Kendra if people look at her when she trains in the car park. Kendra said she does not notice them because she is focused on her training. She wants to be the best for the Championships. Kendra has a strict schedule to be fit.

This is Kendra's fourth World Championships. There will be 27 countries playing. Kendra is happy to have support from fans in England. She wants people to see netball as a good sport. There will be more pressure because they are playing at home. People want them to win their first game against Barbados.

The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra says the Championships will be hard. There are no breaks between games, and they must be ready to play well. The game has become faster and tougher over the years. Kendra believes that all the training is important to win. But after the game, players are friends.

Netball is also using science to help players train better. Kendra thinks it is important to have a strong mind and to help her team. She has planned her netball career carefully. Kendra decided that this competition will be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future.

As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, Kendra might cry because she is happy. Her supporters will be with her all the time."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.

When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is like a small car. It goes three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.

If there is a problem, Rachel can press a panic button. This button makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.

The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. She was on a ship with an instructor. He told her what to do in an emergency. They wanted to see how she would feel in a small space. Now, Rachel has dived six times. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was leaving equipment to study a project that would make a hole in a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. They release water that looks like black smoke. This water comes out very fast and is very hot.

The only time Rachel was scared was when she dived with an American team. They were using a long rope when there was a big explosion. Rachel thought she would die. They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was amazing!

Diving to the bottom of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the window, she sees the volcano chimneys. She feels wonder. She has studied black smokers for three years. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. People often decide what they think about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, and how we talk.

Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard and graduated. She felt confident. She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she did not want to be late. She believed it was important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not care about their appearance at an interview, how can they be a good teacher?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who look good at interviews are more likely to care about their jobs. Many people forget how important it is to look professional. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a big company. When her boss retired, she wanted to be the new boss but did not get an interview. She asked why and was told she did not look like an office manager. They suggested she change her clothes before applying again. Janet was surprised because she thought she did a good job and that her clothes should not matter.

How we move and use our hands can also affect what the interviewer thinks. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message comes from the words we use. 38% comes from our voice, and 55% comes from our facial expressions. If our words and our face say different things, people will believe our face more. So, it is important that our words match our body language. Confusing messages can make the interviewer unsure.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, had a great interview and was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how excited she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She thinks she could have asked for more money if she had stayed calm.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us in an interview. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, says it is good to learn about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can help you know what the company does. You can mention something that interests you during the interview. This shows you care about the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and using short sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long sentences. Successful communicators use short sentences and key points."""

FCE_6,"**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

A. **Darius (Runner)**  
I have always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country and won a medal. Not many people heard about it, which was sad. I hoped to get some money for training, because it is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there, and I have to be very disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I want to go to the next Olympics - that would be amazing.

B. **Gabriel (Surfer)**  
In surfing, the community is small. I see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are early in the morning. So, I do not go to late-night parties. I do not mind, but I love to sleep in. I have to give that up too. But it is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I like to celebrate, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning helped me get a job on TV, so now I am a bit famous.

C. **Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in a big way. Some people say we act like kids, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so I like to come back and hang out with my friends. You cannot only think about sports all the time; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but not many people recognize me on the street. I do not want to be famous. I get nice letters from fans, and I reply to every one.

D. **Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to play in front of a crowd. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many fans. I like being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. But my last girlfriend did not like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports. I focus on my game now and will think about other things in life when I retire, which is early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Shopping with Kids**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""My kids want to buy everything they see. They want cereal, toys, and videos. I cannot buy all these things. If I say yes, I feel bad because I know it is not good for them. But if I say no, I feel bad too. I try not to take them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to choose things.""

Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, especially on TV. Children do not always understand why their parents say no to some things. Parents want to give their kids healthy food, but ads can make unhealthy food look very good.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their kids eat. They want to teach them about healthy food. But if kids only see ads, they get a one-sided view."" Parents feel stressed because they have to say yes or no to their children's requests.

One mother says she talks to her son about ads and food. She tries to help him understand that not all ads are good. Now, he does not ask for things she does not want to buy. 

Parents sometimes feel confused about what to say. Mike, a father, says, ""I tell my son not to buy sweets because they are bad for him, but I buy treats for myself. It is hard to be fair. If I feel happy, I might say yes more often.""

Supermarkets can help parents by not putting sweets at the checkout or by having play areas for kids. If parents can shop without their kids asking for things, they might come to the store more often."

Emma Marsden asked six women how they get their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann** (Journalist and author): ""I get energy from excitement. I like challenges and learning new things. Dancing gives me energy too. Right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. If I am bored, I feel tired. Doing something useful, even small things, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey** (Magazine editor): ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I love my job. If you like what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need sleep to feel good. When I sleep six hours, I feel a bit tired. Exercise gives me energy, but I need to find the time to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to exercise at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale** (Disc jockey): ""I don’t eat healthy food for energy. I think being positive gives me energy. I don’t like negative people. I believe we should enjoy life. I love my job and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many young and lively people. I like taking photos, but I’m not sure if I’m good at it. I also write words for fun songs when I travel.""

D. **Floella Benjamin** (Author and children's TV presenter): ""I get energy from doing things I enjoy. I believe in my work and being positive helps. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Smiling at people can make you feel good. I try to eat healthy food and I don’t smoke or drink. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach** (Author and playwright): ""I love making gardens from empty land. I once turned a concrete area into a garden. It was better than exercising. I also get energy from knowing people want to read my writing. I like exploring nature, even if it is private land. It feels fun and childlike.""

F. **Katherine Monblot** (Therapist): ""You need to care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do makes me tired. I used to be on many committees, but I didn’t like it. You have a limited amount of energy, so use it for what is important to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating is a fun activity that people have done for many years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. Later, they started using iron skates. In Scandinavia, skating was very important for rich people. 

In the early 1900s, skating was fancy. But in 1924, a young girl named Sonja Henie made skating more exciting. Now, skating is both beautiful and hard work. 

If you want to learn to skate, you need to balance and control your body. To balance, keep your legs slightly bent and lean a little forward. Your feet should be close together and turned out. When you push with one foot, move the other foot a little. 

It is important to know how to fall safely. Even good skaters fall sometimes. To fall without getting hurt, stay relaxed. When you fall, use your hands to help you get up. First, go to your knees, then stand up.

Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, or speed skating. It is best to start with figure skating. Many ice rinks have teachers to help you learn.

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate well, you should practice exercises to warm up your body. This helps your legs, back, and shoulders. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid feeling stiff.

Skating helps you balance and move better. It is also good for your heart and lungs. When you skate, swim, or jog, you can be very healthy and fit!"

I don’t have time to watch TV or go out with friends. I focus on gymnastics and school. Sometimes I feel very tired, and my coach gives me a day off, but I usually keep training. If I take too many days off, I get stiff.""

B. Annika's mother says, ""Annika has always been very talented. Some parents push their children too much, but Annika wants to do this. It takes a lot of time and energy. People say we give up a lot, but we love the sport and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was shy. Now she has friends from all over the world and is more confident.""

C. Sarah Stokes is 10 years old. She started show-jumping when she was 10 and has won the British National Championship. She says, ""I am happy my parents like show-jumping. They train me and take me everywhere. The shows can last from one to five days. I love it! My goal this year is to join the British young riders team. I want to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. Sarah's mother says, ""Sarah loved horses from the first time she sat on one. When she was 5, she woke up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is very organized and happy on a horse. It is wonderful to see your child succeed at something they love.""

E. Jane McShane is 10 years old and is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. She says, ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone and it is fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t want to feel embarrassed.""

F. Jane's mother says, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. Jane loved chess right away. By 6, she was beating adults. I am happy when she wins, but if she wants to stop playing, I will support her. I want her to use her talent and be happy."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already very tall. Now, he is the tallest man in Britain at 228 cm.

Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were a long time ago. We are getting better food now, which helps us grow.

A scientist named Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago. Long ago, people ate many different foods. Women picked fruits and herbs, and men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants.

About 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed things a lot. Now, most of the land is used for farming. Three main plants—wheat, rice, and maize—give most of the food for people today. This simple diet has made many people unhealthy. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Their teeth got worse, and they got more diseases. Farming was not good for health, but it helped feed more people. 

Now, in rich countries like Europe, the US, and Japan, people are eating better again. The average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but there are still problems. 

Beds have not gotten longer since 1860, and there is less room for legs on planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often. 

Some scientists think we might stop growing taller soon. They say we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. But, even if some people are taller, as a group, we might be getting smaller. 

A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the world is warmer, we might be getting thinner and shorter. So, as the planet gets hotter, we might not grow taller anymore."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. 

Studio audiences are a common part of TV shows, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited. We might wonder, ""Who are these people?"" 

Some people think studio audiences are not important. They say that even TV workers do not care about them. I thought studio audiences were just made up of silly people who want to be on TV. But this is not true. Studio audiences are made up of many different people. TV shows want different types of people to come to watch.

Many people at home do not understand why someone would want to watch a show in a studio. Why would they travel far and wait a long time just to see what they can watch at home? One reason is that some people hope to be on TV for a moment. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said, ""I came because it was a chance to be on TV."" 

Another reason is that people want to see how a show is made. But many people said, ""A friend gave me a ticket."" 

Most of us have not been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers, and someone shows signs that say ""APPLAUD"" or ""LAUGH."" You clap or laugh when you see these signs. This is true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, ""We think a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch at home, you miss a lot."" 

I missed seeing the actors because I could only see the back of someone’s head. I ended up watching the show on a monitor. 

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch TV, but that is not what matters. For most people, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I like pretty villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to the village of Lastingham. Riding my bike was fun. I loved to explore the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also new. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first travel writing.

**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more money. The view is not amazing. The train goes over fields with sheep and next to a canal. But I like one part of the trip. The train goes through back gardens. For a moment, I see people making tea, washing dishes, and opening chairs. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape with fields, sheep, and a faraway grey sea. It makes me look closer and find new things.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to get to and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. Some surfers come, but most visitors just enjoy the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and has many shipwrecks. You can walk along the coast and visit beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a big, open area that is great for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is quiet and empty, and I like the space. I found this place by chance when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, sometimes with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to feel connected to my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and villages. There was a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you would never come back. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."

We love animals and enjoy having them around. One day, my daughter called me at work. She found a pine snake and asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals like this. 

I got home late. I started to cook when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. There was a problem with our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room. 

I tried to help, but I tripped and fell. I saw the snake escaping from the table and onto the floor. The cat, mouse, and kids were all jumping around. The snake was moving fast, and the dog was barking. 

The pot in the kitchen boiled over. I turned it off and went back to help. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse. The mouse was wet but okay. 

I looked at the snake. It seemed strong. I sat on the floor and waited. Slowly, the snake relaxed. I carefully picked it up and took it to the end of the garden. I wanted to let it go near a tree. 

When I let go of the snake, it climbed up my shoulders like a warm scarf. My oldest child, DJ, said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not."" I asked the kids to help me move the snake. Slowly, it went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. 

As the snake left, my three-year-old son, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

""Write to me! In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is not common anymore. But I love getting letters. It is exciting to see a letter come, to know who it is from, and to read what is inside. I have written letters for a long time. I started by writing little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I was 18, I moved to London to study to be a doctor. I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. My father sometimes wrote long, funny letters. Most letters were about everyday life. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.

I also got letters from my boyfriends. They were away for work or school, and we wrote to each other. Writing letters helped our relationships. I could say what I felt better in a letter than by talking. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but letters with news are better! I like getting letters from faraway places, like Sri Lanka, Australia, and Canada. I also have a friend in France. We started talking in a restaurant, and I asked for her address. Now we write to each other. I can practice my French with her.

This summer, my family and I visited my friend in Texas. We had written to each other for 29 years but had never met. People were surprised that we wrote for so long. My children also write letters. Like my mother, I make them write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas too. I hope everyone keeps writing letters!"""

Tourists are hurting old rock art in the French Alps. There are 36,000 drawings on the rocks at Mont Bego. These drawings are very old, about 4,000 years. They show cows, fields, and gods. Many people visit this place, but some do not care for the art. They write on the rocks and damage the pictures.

Jean Clottes is a leader in rock art. He says, ""People think the pictures will always be here. But if they keep getting damaged, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and hurting them. Some people even take pieces of the rocks home. Others rub the drawings to take better photos.

Some visitors bring sticks to scratch their names on the rocks. Experts have different ideas on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from a museum in Paris, thinks the best way is to close the mountain to the public. He says this will help save the art. But Jean Clottes thinks this will make people angry. He wants to save the drawings but keep the area open.

David Lavergne, an architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says it is hard to stop visitors from damaging the art. He thinks they might need to charge money to help pay for guards. 

Annie Echassoux, who studies the site, is worried. She says more tourists will come because it is easier to reach now. She believes they should block off some areas and have guides. She says it is important to find money to protect the drawings because they are a historic site. If they do not act, future generations will lose this art."
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""My kids want everything they see. They want cereal, toys, and videos. I cannot buy all these things. If I say yes, I feel bad because I know it is not good for them. But if I say no, I feel bad too. I try not to take them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to choose things.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, especially on TV. Children do not always understand why their parents say no to certain things. Parents want to give their children healthy food, but ads can make unhealthy food look very good.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat. They want to teach them about healthy food. But if children only see ads, they get a one-sided view."" Parents feel they have to say no to their children a lot because of ads.

The rules for TV ads say that advertisers cannot tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Susan Dibb says, ""The goal of ads is to make people want to buy things."" 

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents. One mother says she talks to her son about ads and food. Now, he does not ask for things she does not want to buy. 

Parents sometimes say no to their children but then buy treats for themselves. Mike, a father, says, ""We do not buy sweets for our son because they are not good for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and children want to enjoy that too. But sometimes, I feel annoyed by their requests. If I am happy, I say yes more often. It is hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets can help parents by not putting sweets at the checkout or by having play areas for children. If parents can shop without their children asking for things, they might come to the store more often."
FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

Climbers used to go to the mountains. Now, people can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is quiet. High on the climbing wall, a French climber named Francois Lombard is hanging upside down by two fingers. He is in a big climbing competition in Birmingham.

The place is called the National Indoor Arena. It is famous for a TV show called Gladiators, but it also has climbing competitions. This is possible because of new technology.

Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather or climb on snow and ice. As climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. When they could not climb outside, they used walls of buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong.

Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls. These walls had special bricks to hold on to. A teacher named Don Robinson built a climbing wall in a hallway at Leeds University in the 1960s. He put real rocks in concrete to make climbing walls.

In the 1970s, many climbing walls were built, but they had problems. The walls were straight, but real cliffs have different shapes. Once a wall was built, it could not be changed. Climbers got bored because the walls were the same.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material. He made shapes like the rocks on cliffs. These shapes could be put on any wall and taken off when climbers wanted something new. French companies also made climbing walls with steel frames. Steel walls were lighter and could be built anywhere. This way, climbers always had new holds to try."
FCE_61,"Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone this, they might say it is risky. Acting can be a risky job. There are many actors, but not many jobs for them. When you choose to be an actor, some friends may think you are crazy. People will give you different advice. But it is your choice, and you are responsible for your dreams.

There are no easy ways to become an actor. You do not have to take tests, and there is no guarantee you will get a job after training. Success depends on luck and talent. There is a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.

Talent is a special skill. It is a mix of natural ability and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on your courage and belief in yourself. 

Why do you want to act? It can be hard to explain. In acting, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to perform.

Actors often do not know how they succeed. They understand some things about their skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they can be out of work one month and then get a chance to audition the next. They may want the job, but they might not get it. 

Actors try to protect themselves from stress and rejection. No one likes to be told ""no."" From the start, when you want to act, you say you are ready and talented. If you do not care about your acting, others will not care about you either."

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already very tall. Now, he is the tallest man in Britain at 228 cm.

Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were a long time ago. We are getting better food now, which helps us grow.

A scientist named Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago. Long ago, people ate many different foods. Women picked fruits and herbs, and men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants.

About 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed how people ate. Now, most of our food comes from just three plants: wheat, rice, and maize. This has made many people unhealthy. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Their teeth got worse, and they got more diseases.

Farming helped feed more people, but many are still not healthy. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are people starting to eat better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

Even though people are getting taller, some things are not changing. Beds are still 190 cm long since 1860. There is less room for legs on planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often.

Scientists think we may stop growing taller soon. They believe we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. But, while some people are getting taller, as a group, we might be getting smaller. A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the weather is warmer, we are getting thinner and shorter. If the planet gets hotter, we might get even smaller."

FCE_5,"**A Fun Game for Business**

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are having fun and making money with a game from their childhood. They live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are playing a game called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought this game from Canada to their family.

When they were kids, the family played pichenotte every weekend. They moved to New Mexico, but they still played the game. Their grandfather made the first pichenotte board from old wooden boxes. When friends came to visit, they were curious about the game because it was new to them.

Three years ago, Dave made a new pichenotte board because the old one was broken. His family and friends liked it. One night, the brothers took the new board to a sports bar. At first, people thought it was silly, but soon they wanted to play too!

Dave learned that pichenotte has a long history. It started in India with a game called 'carroms.' Then it became 'squails' in Britain. British people brought it to Canada, where it became pichenotte.

Pichenotte is a game for 2 to 4 players. Each player has 12 pieces called 'pucks.' They flick the pucks across a board to score points. If a puck goes into a small hole, it is worth 20 points. The game is quick and lasts about two minutes.

The brothers saw that many people liked the game at the bar. They made more boards and sold them at markets. People loved the game, and soon there were competitions with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup.' 

Now, the brothers make pichenotte boards full-time. They have a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of strong wood and costs $595. 

There are no professional pichenotte players yet, but the brothers hope to make their game famous. For now, they enjoy playing pichenotte and working together."
FCE_41,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE

When you come to the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this place was just empty land with many weeds. People thought it was not useful. One man and his wife worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful village you see now. 

They moved a lot of soil and clay to make the land look nice. They used machines, but many people also worked very hard. They brought in 1,000 tonnes of good soil to make the grass, flowers, and rocks. They planted many trees and bushes that can grow near the sea and can survive strong winds in winter. Some plants came from local shops, but some came from far away places like Canada and New Zealand.

Colin Sims had the idea for the village. He made over 100 models by himself for nine years after the village opened in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, wood, and plastic. They are made to last in all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how to make the models strong. Soon, he became an expert too. 

You will see that all the models are made to the same size and have many small details. This took a lot of time and special building methods. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its good work and care. Other model villages in England use the same building methods. 

All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. It looks like a 13th-century stone house with a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest part of the village.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models. If you touch them, it can take us a long time to fix them. You can take photos from the paths only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.

To enjoy the village more, you will see buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to make the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village better. We also want to know if any models need fixing.

We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village!"

Every week, British newspapers show pictures of famous people. These pictures often invade their privacy. Sometimes, pop stars take pictures with photographers, but this is not common. Most of the time, these pictures hurt the famous people when they see their private moments in the news. 

There is a group called the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that helps with these problems, but very few people ask for their help. The pictures are usually not important for the public. For example, does a picture of a famous actress in a hotel help anyone? The actress has complained about these pictures before, but she did not ask the PCC for help. It is surprising that the PCC did not start an investigation. 

The PCC should look into bad stories about pop stars too. Many famous people do not make formal complaints. The PCC could help stop these bad stories. If they did, newspapers would have to change. Other newspapers would report this, and people would not like the bad stories. Photographers would also have a hard time if they could not take sneaky pictures anymore.

But the PCC has a big job. How would they know when to investigate? Should they ask the famous person if they want to complain? If the person does not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Famous people might expect the PCC to help them, but they could be upset if they do not. 

Also, it is hard for the PCC to watch all the newspapers in Britain. People might feel embarrassed if their privacy is invaded, and they may not want an investigation. Many just want to forget about it and move on. Some might be scared that if they complain, worse stories will come out. 

One British comedian did not complain when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He was afraid that the newspaper would make fun of him. This fear is common. People think they will be targeted again if they complain. It is difficult to find a simple solution to this problem."

We are not talking about people who want a short job while looking for a permanent one. We also do not talk about people who leave a job they do not like after a few weeks. 

This is for people who want to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and know what you want to do. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to focus on one area, move up to a job with more responsibility, or change to a different field. 

You should choose your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. It should help you grow and give you more responsibility. 

If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and then find your second job. Future employers will see that you have traveled and are ready to work.

If the line breaks, the finder keeps it. I have many more kites."" He shows Paul his beautiful kites. They are all the same size, made of paper and bamboo.

They sit in the shade of the trees by the Beach of the Seven Lagoons. They watch the big kite festival. There are 10 platforms on the beach. Helpers hold the kites, and competitors hold the lines. When the whistle blows, the crowd cheers, and the kites fly into the sky. More than 500 men and boys are in the competition. Each person has four kites. The kites are judged on how they look and how well they fly.

""Flying kites is not hard,"" Adnan says. ""But making them is a skill. Come to my house, and I will show you."" Paul gets five invitations that day and decides to go to Adnan's house. There, he drinks cold tea and eats fish crackers. Adnan asks him to come back the next day to fix his kite, but Paul cannot.

Instead, Paul drives to Kuala Lumpur. He takes a wrong turn and finds a river. A small boat is there to take people across. He sees a sign that says, ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" He starts walking but does not know it is all uphill and slippery. At the end of the path, he meets Baba, who has a kitchen and some bamboo huts. Paul decides to stay there, even though he worries about insects.

Flora is twelve. She has trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby for the weekends. I was happy at home, so I didn't want to come at first. But now, I am very glad I did.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember better than adults. The kitchen can be messy when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""

PET_21,"MONEY

What is money? Money is things like the pound, the dollar, or the franc. Money is different from a gram or a kilometre because you can use it to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that does not cost much to make.

A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, gave corn to Mr. Hive for honey. This was a trade between two people who wanted what the other had. 

Over time, many societies made their own types of money, called currencies. Now, most people use a national currency to buy and sell things."

PET_3,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. She was the first woman scientist in history. Her father was the head of Alexandria University. He wanted her to have a good education. This was special because most women could not study at that time.

Hypatia studied in Athens and Rome. Then she went back to Alexandria and started teaching math. She became famous for her knowledge. We do not have her books, but we know she wrote important math works. 

Hypatia also liked technology. She made tools to help her with science. Many leaders were afraid of science, and it was dangerous for scientists. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Grass**

Grass is a very successful plant. There are more than 9,000 types of grass. You can find grass everywhere in the world. Grass can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic.

Grasslands are home to many animals. There are small insects and birds, and also big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to live.

Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. Unlike other plants, new grass grows from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again. There is always food for them."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai is a young woman who loves fashion. She just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. When she was a child, she liked to draw clothes and make designs. She did not tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to work in fashion. She thought they wanted her to have a different job, so she went to university to study management.

After university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising company. She went to many events but could not buy the nice clothes she wanted. So, she started to make skirts and tops for herself. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. 

Kal found a small shop in London that wanted to sell her designs. The clothes were very popular, and none came back. This made her feel good, and she decided to leave her job in advertising. She took a loan of £20,000 to start her own women’s clothing brand. 

Kal's parents were happy and supported her decision. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000. Her clothes are in fashion magazines, and she designs for pop stars. She feels very lucky to do what she loves and get paid for it. She says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,"**Sunningdale Hotel**

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913. Princess Louise opened it. Many people from all over the world have stayed here. In 80 years, over 50,000 guests from 174 countries visited Sunningdale.

The hotel is on a main road to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes by bus to get to the center. Buses to other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Guests should not take buses with a blue sign that says ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is an underground station less than 100 meters away.

The hotel has 200 single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the hall. The hotel also has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are eight pianos for guests to use. Guests can park their cars in the hotel drive. Daily newspapers are free, and you can buy stamps at the office.

Guests who stay a long time must pay for their room every week in advance. They need to tell the hotel one week before they leave. Both short and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first.

Meal times are: 
- Breakfast: 7 am - 9:30 am 
- Lunch: 1 pm - 2 pm 
- Dinner: 5:30 pm - 7 pm 

If you study or work late, you can ask for dinner until 11 pm. Write your name on the late list or call before 7 pm. There are 10 choices for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires are allowed in the hotel. Guests should be quiet, especially from 11 pm to 8 am. If you arrive by train, it is best to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main train station."
PET_39,"Tom Cruise

Tom Cruise is a very famous actor. He has many fans. But his life was not always easy. When he was a boy, Tom was shy. He had trouble making friends, but he liked to act in school plays.

After high school, Tom went to New York to find a job. He worked as a porter and took acting classes. In 1980, a director named Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. 

Ten years later, Tom was very successful. He was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. He made a lot of money for each movie. 

Today, Tom still acts in movies. He is still very popular with many fans around the world."
PET_18,"LITTLE CAT, LITTLE CAT, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

Bo is a little cat. One day, she went into a big van. The van was for furniture. Bo had a big adventure! The driver found her after a long trip. He drove more than 500 kilometres. 

The driver was very tired and hungry. He gave Bo some milk. Then, he tried to find her owner. He called the last people he delivered to, but they did not lose a cat. 

It was late, so the driver took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital. 

Bo's owner was looking for her too. He searched everywhere. Then, he remembered the furniture van that came to his neighbour. He called the company. Soon, Bo was back home safe and sound."
PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train goes from the warm north to the cold south. Many people call it the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is often late.

In the 1920s, there was a plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide by train. They built a line to Alice Springs, but floods made it hard for trains to run. A new train line was finished just before Mark's trip. The Ghan train is not very fast, and it has few stops. Most people on the train are on holiday. The food on the train is very good, but it is not a luxury train like the Orient Express. 

The train was first built to carry goods, not people. It was faster to send goods from Europe to the south of Australia by train than by ship. The Ghan is the first train in the world to go north to south across a continent.

When Mark waited to get on the Ghan, he saw that everyone was excited. Many older Australians were ready to board. The first stop was Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some people got off to take a boat trip. Mark stayed on the train until Alice Springs. There, he went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. Climbing the rock is not popular now, so they just walked around it and watched the sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south. Many people stop their journey there. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, they reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's journey was over. The train may not have done everything the ads said, but it took him to some amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing Ben Nevis**

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first climb on Ben Nevis. 

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high, which is very long for a climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the ""Carries."" These are big bowls in the mountain, halfway up. 

We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is very hard, like ice. Even though some people in our group were very good climbers, we took safety equipment. This included lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. 

The weather was good, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is hard. The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest climber, so I had to rest more often. The others stopped to wait for me, but when I caught up, they started again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb. 

After climbing 200 meters, we reached Tower Ridge. It is very narrow, only 1.5 meters wide, and the mountain drops down a lot on both sides. We had to stay calm and focus on every step as we walked slowly. 

After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. But it was misty when we got to the top. 

Going back down to camp can be hard too. You need to read a map well. A wrong turn can be dangerous in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. 

When I was safe in the tent, I could finally say I enjoyed the climb. But I was proud that I made it to the top!"
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week is very exciting! We moved to our new school building. It is a great place. The builders used wood to make it, like our old school. This new school is also good for the environment. 

The school took a long time to build. We watched the builders work. It was fun to see them clear the land, but some nice land is now gone. The building was very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the old school next door. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We are excited to use them when the new sports field is ready.

When you come into the school, you will see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat inside. It also keeps the sound inside, so when we sing, it feels like a concert hall!

You will also see a tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went to see it with our teacher. It spins very fast and is very big!

We are already using the school, but some parts are not finished. We are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to the old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn better here!"

PET_2,"A month ago, I did not know that I would be 30 meters above the ground on a Saturday afternoon in November. Now, I look down at the river below me and understand why people like rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place was not very nice, but we had beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met ten other people in our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, and the others went rock-climbing. Then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we did."
PET_23,"Letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. My handbag had my cheque book, address book, and my purse. My purse had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I lost it, it was too late. I was very worried because I am 72 years old and far from home. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. The bus driver said I could keep the fare.

I got home safely. Soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus. He said they found my handbag and would bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, and everything was inside.

I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"Sharks

Sharks are big and scary animals in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement in the water. This helps them catch smaller fish for food. 

Sharks are different from other fish. Most fish can stay still, but sharks must swim all the time to breathe. They do not sleep much. If a shark is turned on its back, it can stop moving. This helps scientists study sharks better."

PET_53,"Joining the Kirov Ballet

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students at the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I did not know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they spoke English, so we could talk.

Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks, my mom stayed with me. When she left, I felt a little sad. One night, I called her because I felt lonely.

The ballet classes in Russia are very hard. I eat a lot to have energy. This helps me do well in class. In the evenings, I watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends.

Now, I feel at home here. I like to walk around the city and visit different shops. In December, it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was warm for that time!

Right now, we are getting ready for a new show, and there is a competition for young dancers that I will enter. I feel very lucky to be here."
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

The Arctic is a cold place. In summer, many people visit to see the midnight sun. In winter, there are not many people. In the late 1980s, some people thought winter could be fun. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an exhibition in a special igloo made of snow in Jukkasjarvi, a small town by the frozen Torne River. This building was called Arctic Hall. Many visitors came to see it.

One night, some guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy. This gave them the idea to make an ice hotel. Now, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world.

Every winter, a team of builders, architects, and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They start building in December. Each week, a new part of the hotel opens until it is all finished on January 7th. The hotel is built outside with snow and ice, so the finishing date can change because of the weather.

In spring, when it gets warm, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, it is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, even if it is very cold outside. Guests get warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves when they stay at the hotel. It is also good to bring sweaters, scarves, and thick socks. Guests should wear bigger shoes to fit the thick socks.

If you want to visit the ICEHOTEL, you can buy warm clothes on their website. You can order these things when you book your stay. They will be in your room when you arrive.

The ICEHOTEL is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. It is 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday. Many people came to the shop. Up to 6,000 people wanted to buy furniture. There were special offers. A leather sofa cost £45, but only until 3 am. A bed cost £30, but only from 3 am to 8 am. 

The shop usually opens from 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours. However, it had to close after only half an hour. 

A police officer said there were too many people. The shop was full, so the managers decided to close the doors. People outside were angry. They thought the furniture would be sold out before they could go in. They did not want to wait in line. 

There was also a long line of cars trying to park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.

One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said, ""I waited in line for three hours. I did not have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. It was not safe. I will come back when they open again, but I do not want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter is a free-diver. She has four world records. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters deep and come back up without help. A year before, she went deeper but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for more than three and a half minutes. She was the first woman to break a man’s world record in any sport.

A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya believes safety and training are very important. Most free-divers focus on one or two events, but Tanya trains the same way for all her events. She spends two-thirds of her training in the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she does not want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit.

When Tanya practices diving, she travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her to not get tired, or it can ruin her training.

When she is not training, Tanya goes to events to talk about sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research and making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved to swim and explore the sea when she was a child. She feels like she is living her childhood dreams now. Because she is famous in some places, people listen to her talk about the environment.

Tanya is now in her thirties. She wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving when she was twenty-five, and she does not plan to stop for many years."
PET_12,"CARTOON FILMS

Cartoon films can be very fun. If you can draw, you can make your drawings move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for everyone. 

In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for kids. But some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and kids can enjoy cartoons together. 

Not all cartoon films were good. For example, The Black Cauldron was not a success. It was too scary for kids and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this. Soon, film companies made a lot of money again."
PET_26,"Caroline Benson is a new TV star. She talks about her first TV role. 

""I did not think I would spend my first year at university making a TV show called The Finnegans. I only acted in school before, but I loved the book since I was eleven years old. My grandmother said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I wanted to play her.

I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She said they wanted to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and asked him to meet me. I flew back and got the role.

Filming started a week after university began. I asked the university for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to write my essays. I did not tell my friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky.

After university, I want to be an actor. My family is not in acting, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I have not received any offers yet. I had a busy social life too. When filming finished, I did not know what to do. I have acted in two college plays since then. 

I have not been home much, and now my first year at university is over. I am going to Greece for the summer with my friends."""
PET_8,"Title: My Story

In 1976, I opened the first 'Body Shop'. I wanted to make enough money to feed my children. Now, 'The Body Shop' is a big company that is growing all over the world. I have learned many things since we started. I want to share these things in this book. 

This book is not just about business or my life. It is about being different to succeed in business. Business can be fun. It can be run with love and can help people. In business and in life, I want to enjoy myself and feel like I am with family. I want the people who work at 'The Body Shop' to feel this way too.

This book shares my ideas with everyone. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' and what we can do together. I find this very exciting, and I hope you do too."

**Day 5:** The river gets narrow here. If the water is deep enough, you might take a smaller boat to the Spanish border at Barca d'Alva. You will return to Tua by bus and see many things on the way.

**Day 6:** In the morning, you will drive to Sao Joao da Pesqueira for a great view of the Douro valley. After lunch on the ship, you will take a train ride through the countryside to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be waiting.

**Day 7:** You will visit Vila Real before going back to the ship for lunch. Then, you will travel down the river to Oporto. You will sleep on the ship.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with time to explore and shop before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugar. Bees can fly very far, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey usually tastes milder than darker honey.

A long time ago, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians valued honey a lot and used it as money. Today, people make and eat honey all over the world. Some studies say honey can help with tiredness and make athletes better. Honey is not just food; it can help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair products."
PET_7,"**Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia in Britain. It has been a place to live for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, when the Normans came, it became one of the largest towns in England. 

Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095. It celebrated 900 years in 1995. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years of being a city. This meant it could govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than London or Manchester. It has about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It grew for 300 years and became rich. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs.

In 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a busy place for business. It has theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centres. There is also a football team called 'The Canaries'. Their colours are green and yellow.

Norwich has a new shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, there was a big hole in the city while builders worked. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall. The park has water pools and many trees. 

The old open market is still in the city and is very popular. Both the market and the new shopping centre are busy. This shows that Norwich has a good mix of old and new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky in Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, is full of bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. It happens every year for nine days. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons that took off from a car park in Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries will come.

**What to See**

The pilots talk to each other on radios. They light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow."" It is a great time to take photos. You need to come just after night falls or before 5:30 am to see the ""glows"" as the balloons go up into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are in many sizes and colors. Some look like animals or cartoon characters, and some look like popular drinks and fast food. Kids will love it!

In the afternoon, you can fly in a balloon over the desert with one of the companies that offer rides. You can also take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride, and you can see the festival from above. There are many other fun things to do, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This helps pilots control where their balloons go.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets online before the festival to avoid long waits. Wear several layers of thin clothes because it can be cool at night and in the morning, but during the day, you need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and don’t forget your camera. If you use film, make sure to get high-speed film for night pictures."
PET_51,"The Eden Project

The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is a very popular place for tourists. The big 'biospheres' look like something from a science fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. It shows how important plants are for people.

Many things we use every day come from plants. For example, we get wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate from plants. There are more than 135,000 types of plants here.

Even if it is cold outside, the plants stay warm because of electric heaters. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. There is also a zone that looks like the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. Soon, they will build a desert zone too."
PET_11,"Some people are not happy with this year's book, New Writing 3. I don’t understand why. It has 500 pages of good writing for £6.99. Most of the book has stories. There are short stories and parts of novels. Some famous writers, like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain, have written in this book. 

Some less famous writers write about food. For example, Jane Harris wrote a story called Those Nails. Be careful! Don’t read it after eating. It has some very bad scenes that might make you feel sick. 

There are also poems from nineteen poets, like R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Jim Crace and Jane Rogers have pieces from their books that are not finished. There is a little non-fiction too. Alan Rusbridger wrote a funny article about newspapers, and Ursula Owen wrote about herself. 

This is a great collection, and I am excited to see what next year’s book will have!"
PET_14,"**Learning the Violin**

Margaret Porter is a violin teacher. She says the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is when children learn about the world. Margaret lives in London. She likes to teach children who are three or four years old. Sometimes, she teaches five-year-olds who really want to learn.

Margaret started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first class had her children’s friends who were five years old. In her classes, there are about twelve students. They have lessons for one hour, every two weeks. Each student also has one lesson with her every week. 

Parents must come to the lessons too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons. 

In the beginning, students learn to play music by listening. They do not read music for a long time. At first, their playing and reading music are very different. Margaret says her way of teaching is not to make great violinists. If a student plays very well, she suggests they learn with other methods."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine has a new CD. It is called ""Here Again."" This is their third CD. The last CD was ""The Waves."" 

There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott plays the bass guitar now. He replaces Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer.

The first song on the CD is a dance song. The band is not making slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is very loud. Many fans will be surprised by these songs. They are very good and could be popular.

The singer, Rob Letchford, sings very well. He can reach all the notes. Fans are happy he recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. If you bought tickets, do not worry. The concerts will be rescheduled when Rob feels better.

On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles. They have slow songs and dance songs that make you want to move. I think the best songs are at the beginning. The last songs are not as good. 

""Here Again"" will be a big hit and help the band become more successful."
PET_36,"San Francisco

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. A Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola found this area in 1769. He saw it first from land, not from the sea. 

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to find gold. But the people who got rich were not the gold seekers. The rich people owned banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

Today, many tourists visit San Francisco. They want to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some people take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."
PET_6,"SAMUEL PEPYS

Samuel Pepys wrote a famous diary. This diary talks about life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys writes about important events, like sickness, a navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about himself. He shares his mistakes, like sleeping in church and looking at pretty girls.

Pepys talks about his home life. He had a fight with his wife, but they made up. He worried when she was sick. He liked music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun.

Pepys was a busy man. He had important jobs. He was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He also helped the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

A long time ago, shoes were not very comfortable or stylish. People used animal skins to cover their feet. They tied these skins around their ankles when it was cold. 

Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton. This depends on what is popular at the time. 

About 150 years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were the same shape and could be worn on either foot. 

In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines help make many shoes quickly and at a lower price."
PET_20,"When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running. I started a running club for women in my area. I was upset because many race organizers say there are not enough women in running, but they do not help by giving women their own changing rooms.

I made posters, and 40 women joined my club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. They wanted to lose weight, but many had not thought about running before. They thought running was hard and painful. They did not think about having fun, talking, and smiling while running in nice places, like by a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes! They also learned about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and I am very happy to see how much they have improved. They are happy too!"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - A SPECIAL DOG SLED RACE**

In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the northern state of the USA. Many people came to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means ""far place."" In 1909, Iditarod became the biggest city in Alaska for a short time.

In summer, boats brought supplies to the towns. But in winter, rivers and the ocean froze, and boats could not come. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for the dog teams to travel across Alaska. They stopped at places called ""roadhouses"" to sleep and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when planes became the main way to travel. But in 1925, there was a big problem. A sickness called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine was far away in Anchorage. Planes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. So, they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.

The trip was over 1,000 kilometers along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, a man from Norway, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo. Togo was very good at finding the way in the snow. The last part of the trip was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped the team from falling into icy water. 

The medicine arrived, and the sickness was stopped. Balto became a hero. Now, every year, there is a dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome. It is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""
PET_45,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**

The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Sweden. In winter, it can be very cold, up to -40 degrees Celsius. Many people visit this place every year. They come to see a special hotel made of ice. 

In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in ice rooms. You can even have a wedding there! The bar is made of ice too, so you should not put hot drinks on it. 

The bedrooms are about -4 degrees Celsius. But don’t worry! Guests get special sleeping bags to keep warm. You can also get warm clothes if you need them. 

The hotel is only open for six months. In summer, it melts. Every winter, workers build it again. They use 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow to make the hotel."
PET_29,"Maria Mutola

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on a boys' football team in Mozambique. They played in a local competition and won. Maria said, ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the other team complained.""

A man named Jose Craveirinha read about Maria in a newspaper. He helped many African athletes. He went to see Maria and saw her playing football. He noticed she was very fast. Jose talked to her about athletics, but Maria did not understand. She only knew about football. Then, he bought her running shoes and took her to train. It was hard work, and her legs hurt.

Jose spoke to Maria's parents. He told them she could be successful and help the family. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, Maria went to train in the United States. She was scared to go because she would miss her family. 

In the US, Maria met other girls who were good athletes. But they worried about different things, like dresses and make-up. Maria worried about her family having enough food. She felt lucky to be there. The trainers were very good, and she learned a lot.

Today, Maria still runs. She lives happily in South Africa with her mother for most of the year."
PET_57,"The Skywalk

The Grand Canyon is in the United States. It was made by the Colorado River. Many people visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and see the view. The view is very beautiful, and the Skywalk makes it even better. 

The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass. You can see the pretty rocks below you. Up to 120 people can stand on the Skywalk at the same time. It opened in 2007, and many people have visited it since then. 

You must wear special covers on your shoes to protect the glass. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air."
PET_9,"THE ROCKIES

The Rocky Mountains are in North America. They start in the North-west and go down south. The Rockies are not as tall as the Alps, but they are very beautiful. There are many roads in the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. 

You can start your trip in Vancouver. Vancouver is a nice city in Canada. You can see the water and the mountains there. People can ski just 15 minutes by car from the city. 

Before, thirty trains left Vancouver every day to go across the country. Now, there are only three trains a week. But the train ride is still very exciting. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you see the beautiful mountains at night."
PET_42,"**ZOOS**

People have kept animals in zoos for a long time. This started over 3,000 years ago in China. The rulers there made a big zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals did tricks for visitors, but now this does not happen. Now, zoos are places where people can see animals acting like they do in nature.

Today, many cities have zoos or wildlife parks. Some people think zoos are good. They say zoos help us learn about animals and nature. We can see wild animals up close because of zoos.

But not everyone likes zoos. Some people think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They say that in some zoos, animals do not have good living conditions. They may live in dirty places and eat bad food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, age 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from other high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, and other bands wore bright T-shirts. We did not look like professional adult bands, but we played very well. Everyone was young, but we were good at performing. Each band even made new songs on stage. It was fun to watch, and it was even better when my band played!  

My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to play can be in the band. But anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We go on trips to jazz summer camps in different places. I have been to a few and learned a lot.  

Many adults are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not hard enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can make your own music, but you also feel part of its history. You play on stage like great jazz musicians did before.  

My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who help us. Without them, we could not do well with our music!"
PET_54,"**Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. It does not rain often. When it rains, the water pipes cannot handle it, and the streets become like rivers. Many winters are dry, so when it rains, the people are happy.

Marrakesh has parks and gardens. These are not only because of the rain. There are underground channels that bring water from the mountains. These channels were made a long time ago, in the 11th century. Places that are mostly dry but have water from channels are called oases.

If you go south from Marrakesh, you will find Skoura. In Skoura, people use all the land to grow food. There are small squares made by the water channels. The Atlas mountains, which have snow in winter, look beautiful in the background."

Three years ago, Gareth and his family joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it is true. Gareth wanted to be a clown since he was three years old."" When Alan lost his job, they looked for jobs in the circus. They both got jobs, and Gareth started to train to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo.

In the summer, they travel with the circus. In the winter, they go home. Gareth's brothers can take care of the house while they are away. Kath says, ""It was not easy. We had to think about many things. We only had a small car and a tiny caravan to sleep in. We left our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long baths.""

Gareth talks about school. He says, ""People ask about my education. But wherever we go, someone teaches me. I use the same books as my friends at school, and I have a computer. I have not fallen behind.""

What about the future? Kath says, ""It was a hard choice, but this is the best way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I am happy, and we enjoy it."" Gareth says, ""One day, I will be the main clown in a circus, maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news group for young people. You can join if you are between 8 and 18 years old. We collect news and write stories. We send these stories to newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites. You can read or listen to the stories on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three places in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more places soon. Since we started in 1994, over 2,500 young people have joined us. Sophie is one of them. She says: ""I heard about Eight-eighteen when they asked me about hip hop music. I met young journalists and saw what they could do. Age did not matter. I went to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me do more than I thought I could. I got a job at 19 and now I check articles for a big news website.""

**Join Us!**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training. You will also have meetings every month to decide who will write each news story. Older members, called ""peer trainers,"" help new members learn basic journalism skills. Some of these trainers talk to groups of young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, like in youth clubs and summer camps. They always have support from older staff.

We have training for new members three times a year. The next training will be in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. You can join Eight-eighteen if you can read and write at any level. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before you book a flight.

In the summer, we take tourists on a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, to see Antarctica and then back. The flight dates for next year are not ready yet, but if you book now, you can change your date if needed.

**Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours. After about 4 hours, we see sea ice and icebergs. We spend 4 hours over Antarctica and then fly back home. During the flight, experts talk about Antarctica and answer questions. There is a camera next to the pilot, so you can see what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will move to the seat on your second pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight. While we are over Antarctica, you can get up and move around the plane to see better. The pilot flies in big circles so everyone can see the sights.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. The captain will check the weather on the morning of the flight and choose the best way to see.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife is far below the plane, so we cannot see them well. We do not land in Antarctica because it is not good for the environment. If you want to see wildlife, you need to go on a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring your camera. We also have some fun photo spots on the plane where you can wear cold weather clothes from Antarctica."
PET_35,"**Little Chefs**

Some children, aged ten to fifteen, spend their Saturdays learning to cook. Many kids want to join, so there is a waiting list of 30 children. Parents pay £280 for the course. The children have fun and learn to make good food.

Bill is ten years old. He says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh when we eat the food we made.""

Flora is twelve. She has trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby for the weekends. I was happy at home, so I didn't want to go at first. But now, I am very glad I came.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember better than adults. The kitchen can be messy when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous for driving. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be on the road, and ice can be under the snow. A car coming towards you might slide on the road.

**Rule Number One:** Drive smoothly. If you move the car too fast or too suddenly, it can be hard to control. When you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you do not spill it.

**Rule Number Two:** Pay attention to the road. Look far ahead, especially if there is ice. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. You might be going faster than you think. 

When the road is wet, allow double the time to stop. On snow, allow three times the time. On ice, allow even more time. Try to keep control of your car, and you will be safe."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

Craigie Aitchison is a painter. He was born in Scotland. He went to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, he found drawing hard, but he kept painting.

When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He liked early Italian artists, and this is seen in his paintings. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He paints colors one on top of another, from light to dark. He says, ""It's a secret - I don’t know what will happen."" He does not start with a plan for the colors.

Aitchison thinks painting is easy. He says, ""Anyone can use colors - you can buy them. I just see how colors look next to each other."" He does not make drawings before he paints because he thinks he might get bored. He changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes to paint people who do not want to see their picture while he is painting. He says, ""If they are worried and want to look, I can’t paint.""

Since he moved to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish art scene. He does not want to follow any tradition. He just paints in his own way. His work still inspires young British painters."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our son Ben, who is 14 years old, asked us for drums for his birthday. At first, we did not want to buy them because of the noise. Ben said, ""It is better than watching TV or playing computer games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""

This was just the start. The other boys in Ben's band came to our house with their guitars and other music things. Now, for many hours each week, our house is loud with their music and singing. 

When the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music is a little strange, they are nice and polite boys. I cannot say if they are good musicians, but they play at local clubs for young people.

We worry that they will not do enough school work because of music, but this has not happened yet. I always tell Ben that his studies are very important. But one thing is sure: Ben was right. Playing music keeps him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College. It is a good private college in Wales. The college helps young people learn about life outside the classroom and study for their exams.

The students are between 16 and 18 years old. They come from many countries. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do helpful activities. They might help on a farm, care for people with learning difficulties, or check rivers for pollution.

Atlantic College has students from different backgrounds. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants to help them. About 25% of the students are British, and many get help from the government.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I admire the college for helping young people understand each other. You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don’t like them. My mother said I argued less with my sister during the summer.""

In short, Atlantic College gives students a great education with methods that work well."

I am 32 years old. I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes and I read books quickly. I also write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. 

Before, I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored. I did not have to think much at my job. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be like them.

Now that I am a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers. Even if we are the same age, I know less than they do. 

But I am happy to study. I know I need a good qualification to get a good job. This is very important to me. I like to spend my weekends reading books instead of going to parties. 

I also enjoy the benefits of being a student, like long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema. Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school is a good choice.'"
PET_48,"Henry Ford

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started to work as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. He drove it for 1,500 kilometers, then he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong and light steel to make cars that were cheap for regular people to buy. 

In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T'. It cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this meant there were not many choices. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it is black."""

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before climbing the mountain, she was a journalist. She lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family. She traveled to Asia with other climbers.

Life on Everest is hard. Rebecca said, ""You must carry everything on your back."" This means you can only take what you need. There is no water to wash, only snow. She did not even take a toothbrush. She usually likes to be clean, but there is no water. Water is heavy, so you only take enough to drink.

On May 17, 1993, Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest. It was the best moment of her life. After that, she became famous. Now, she has written a book about her trip. People often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job on a science program on television.

Rebecca is well known today. She has more money, but she still lives in her small flat in south London with her pictures and books about mountains."
KET_24,"Dear Mike, 

I am sorry you could not come to my party yesterday. Jon said you were sick with a bad cold and stayed in bed. Are you better now? 

The party was very good! It was the best party I have ever had! Many of my friends were there, and they gave me nice presents. 

I will tell you more about the party when you come to school on Monday.

KET_13,"**CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are big birds. They are blue and white. When autumn comes, they fly south to find warm weather. In Canada, the winters are very cold. The birds can die if they stay there.

Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. The young birds lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know what to do in autumn."" 

Bill had a small plane. He decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he flew short trips in his plane, and the young geese followed him.

When autumn came and it got cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States. Virginia is 600 miles south of Canada. The geese followed him all the way.

Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They did not come, so he flew to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks but could not find them.

When Bill got back home, he saw the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home by themselves!"
KET_16,"ESTHER'S STORY

Esther finished school when she was sixteen years old. For her birthday, her aunt Flory gave her £500. Most of Esther's friends went to college, but Esther used the money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and soon had £1,000.

At first, her parents did not want her to make jam. They wanted her to study and become a teacher or a doctor. But Esther did not listen. She kept making jam. After a few months, she sold her jam at the local market. Then, she started making orange juice and sold it to a school where her friend worked.

After two years, her business grew a lot, and her parents were happy. She made many kinds of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She was very busy, so she hired some people to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens. They sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep. Each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool from the sheep. This helps the sheep not to get too warm.

Five years ago, Jenny made sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and hot, so people did not want to buy sweaters. Then, she made socks. Everyone loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started.

At first, Jenny made the socks at home. Soon, she had many customers. So, she sent the wool to a factory. Now, the socks are made on machines. There are six colors and five sizes for all ages. There are different socks for walking, sports, and skiing.

Jenny is very busy at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, there are many letters from happy customers from all over the world."

KET_10,"**BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON**

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told us that house burglaries have gone up by more than 30% from last year. He said that 67% of burglaries happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. 

Night-time burglaries are not common because families are usually at home then. But winter afternoons are good for burglars because it is dark and they can hide easily. Many houses are empty at this time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch other houses when people are not home. They should call the police if they see something strange.

""We will also tell you how to make your house safe,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This help costs nothing."""
KET_27,"Dear Lynne and Tony,

Thank you for the two nights I stayed in your nice home. It was good to see you again. Here are the photos of your children that you wanted. They are nice photos, right? I hope you like them. I love my new camera. I will visit my sister in New York next week. I will take many photos there, too. I have not seen my sister for a long time.

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming, people looked for plants and fruit in the forest to eat. They moved a lot to find food. About 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow food. These people were the first farmers. 

Farming helped people stay in one place. Their villages became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers grew food for everyone. 

But farming was hard when the weather was bad. Sometimes, people did not have enough food to eat. 

Today, farmers can grow more food. The food travels a long way to reach our homes."
KET_22,"**WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE**

Nicola Peet finished school when she was eighteen. Then, she went to college. After that, she worked at a local airport. After nine months, she started working for Saudi Arabian Airlines. Later, she joined British Airways as an air hostess. Four years later, she became a manager.

This is what she said about her job: ""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time in the air. I teach air hostesses and help them with problems. I also go to many meetings. I usually work from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. 

At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer. Then, I talk with some air hostesses. Sometimes, I go on long flights to see how the air hostesses are doing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I like office work, too. 

Travelling can be hard. When I come back from a long trip, I just want to eat and go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways. I want to stay there and keep travelling."""

KET_62,"The Weather People care about the weather for many reasons. The weather is important for many jobs. For example, farmers need to know about the weather. Many years ago, farmers looked at the sky, animals, and flowers to understand the weather. Now, we have computers that help us learn about the weather. People can also get weather information on their mobile phones. 

Today, many people still believe old ideas about the weather. They say if the sky is red in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people think that if cows lie down in the fields, it will rain soon."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are 14-year-old boys. They live in a small town in Canada. They are good friends and go to the same school. On weekends, they like to go fishing or swimming. But for the last few months, they have stayed in Peter's room. They are working on a computer game.

This game is not for homework. They made a new word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin. Kevin has trouble reading. He learns better with pictures and sounds. Frazer wanted to help him.

Frazer and Peter worked together for a long time to make this game. Now it is ready to use. It is a game with pictures and sounds. For example, when you see the word ""hat,"" you also see a picture of a hat. You can hear Peter say, ""Hat! Hat!"" at the same time.

Frazer and Peter have won many prizes for their game. Soon, it will be sold all over the world. Many schools want to buy it."
KET_31,"HOW DOES THE IRISH POP GROUP 'BOYZONE' LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE?

Sleeping well is very important. When I go home to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. But after a concert, I find it hard to sleep because my head is full of music. 

Sport is also important. Before my car accident, I went to the sports center for two and a half hours every day, five days a week. Now, I cannot do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups every day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat healthy food. I drink a lot of water because it is good for health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I do not always drink that much.

People should not work all the time. I love my job, but I also like to do other things. In my free time, I listen to music or watch TV. It is good to relax sometimes. 

I do not feel tired anymore since the doctor told me to eat better. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day. But I still eat burgers sometimes!"
KET_58,"**Bollywood**

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It makes about 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made more than 29,000 films. This is more than the USA, so it is the biggest film industry in the world. 

Many Indians like to watch films. Ten million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films often tell love stories. They have a lot of singing and dancing. People outside India also like Indian films. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling films to other countries.

Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. Most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs more than $5 million.

Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is a famous actor in India. He has been in more than 140 films and has acted for almost 40 years."
KET_37,"Bill Bryson

I was born in the United States. I have written many travel books about England. I lived in England with my wife and four children for 20 years. Now, we live in the United States for the last three years. Our children are learning about life in the United States. I think they will be happy because they have lived in two countries.

I like Britain and want to go back, but my daughter, Felicity, will start college here soon. So, I cannot go back for four years. I just went to England for six weeks. I worked on a radio show about the English language and talked about my new book.

Most writers do not like to travel and sell their books. I do not mind it. I like to visit new places and meet new people. It is very different from my life in the United States when I write. In England, people drove me in big cars and I stayed in nice hotels. It was good because I did not have to pay for anything. Everyone was nice to me and it was fun."

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes came to England more than 50 years ago. The Giant Schnauzer is bigger and has not been in England for long. The Giant Schnauzer is 65 to 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair, and they need haircuts often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. 

Schnauzers come from Germany. Farmers use these dogs to help with sheep. The police also use Schnauzers because they are very smart. Schnauzers are good family dogs. They are friendly and great with young children."

Parrots are beautiful birds. They have nice colors and long tails. You can see them in forests or zoos. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They like to live in big groups. Parrots eat a lot of fruit, so they can be a problem for farmers.

There are many types of parrots. All parrots have strong beaks and feet. They use their beaks and feet to climb and hold food. Some parrots can live for 80 years. They are very noisy, but they are smart. You can teach them to talk. Some zoos have shows with parrots. You can watch the parrots do tricks they have learned."

KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

A long time ago, in 1700, there were no policemen in London. Only a few old men walked the streets at night to help keep people safe. They did not get paid much money. 

London was getting bigger and very dirty. Many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money, so people stayed at home a lot. 

In 1750, a man named Henry Fielding paid some people to stop the thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. 

Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London was much bigger and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force started with 3,000 officers. Most of them walked, but some rode horses. 

Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police get paid well, and the few who ride horses get paid even more."

The city is full of actors and artists from many countries. They come to Edinburgh for the biggest arts festival in Britain. 

During the festival, the streets are full of music and dance from morning to night. You can see artists painting pictures on the streets. One fun part of the Festival is the 'Fringe'. Here, students do funny shows in small places like cafes. Many tourists come to see new films, plays, and listen to famous musicians.

KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will find Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake is covered with ice. Many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. They sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has come here for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need light but warm clothes: two pairs of socks, gloves, thin sweaters, and a snow suit."" 

Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small hole. Then, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. You put the line through the hole and into the water. When the fish eat the bread, you pull the line up. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but Bob prefers chocolate or snacks after he catches three or four fish. 

Today, Bob has caught twenty-five fish! He says, ""It's a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"""

A bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were very expensive. Only rich people could buy them. These early bicycles looked very different from today’s bicycles. Later, bicycles became cheaper, and many people bought them. People started riding bicycles to work and for fun. 

Today, many people use cars more than bicycles. Cars are faster, and you don’t get wet when it rains! But some people still like to ride bicycles to work. They say there are too many cars in the city, and it is hard to find a place to park!"
KET_63,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family. We had a beach holiday. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had nice flower gardens, but we wanted to see the elephant show.

We went to a big area with seats. Three elephants came in with their trainers. They stood in front of a big white card. Each elephant had a paintbrush. They started to paint on the card. The trainers gave them new brushes with paint and took the old ones away. The elephants followed the trainers' instructions and made pictures. 

I was surprised! One picture was of a river, one was of a tree, and the last one was of flowers. When the trainers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants bananas we brought for lunch.

Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore. The smartest elephants live in special places where people can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many kinds of cats. They are different in size and look. Tigers are the biggest cats. They can be 3.7 meters long from head to tail. Most cats do not like water, but tigers like to lie in water when it is hot!

Lions are the only cats that live in big family groups. Many lions work together to find food for the group. They usually live in flat, open places where they can see far and follow other animals easily.

All cats need good eyes to catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. 

Ostriches have wings like all birds, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, up to 90 kilometres an hour. This makes it hard for other animals to catch them. 

Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens. They take about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live many days without water."

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people climb Kilimanjaro. They can be very young, like a seven-year-old boy, or very old, like an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and many tourists like it.

Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and rainy. But at the top, there is ice and snow, and it can be very cold, below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Otters

Not many people have seen an otter. Otters live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim faster than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This helps them stay under water for a long time.

Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty. Many fish and insects died, so otters had no food. But now, the rivers are clean, and there is a lot of food for otters."
KET_57,"Dear Deshini,

29th August 2002  

Dear John,  

Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a good teacher. I liked my time in Cambridge. Now, I am at my brother's flat. He is studying to be a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go home to Greece.  

I like London a lot. Yesterday, we went to Regents Park by bus. It was sunny and we had fun. Tonight, I will see a film with my brother and his friends.  

I will write again from Greece.  

Best wishes,  
Kostas"
KET_42,"Dear David, 

I will visit your country next month. I will travel with two friends. We do not know where to stay. Are there cheap hotels in your town? We want to stay in the center. Can you help us? 

Carlos 

Dear Carlos, 

Hotels in the center are expensive, but I have good news. I talked to my aunt Gloria. She says you can stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house! Is that okay for you? 

David"
KET_59,"Buildings

People have always made buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We have museums to keep beautiful things.

Many people work together to build a building. The architect is the person who decides how the building will look. They draw pictures to show their ideas. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers build it carefully.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous building. It has a beautiful roof. The building looks nice from all sides, not just the top. The Olympic Stadium in Munich is also famous. It looks like a tent made of glass."
KET_54,"Text: ""Indre, I have a problem and I need your help. Can you go shopping with me tomorrow? My grandmother is turning 80 next month and she is having a party on Saturday. I don’t have anything to wear. My trousers are too short for me now! I want to buy new trousers and maybe some boots. I don’t have a lot of money, but I think it will be enough. Do you want to meet in the morning or the afternoon? Please tell me. Sarika"""
KET_32,"The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England. They are close to each other. Between these towns, there are many green hills and fields. On one hill, there is a big picture of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant. The village next to him is called Cerne. 

We do not know when the Cerne Giant was made, but it was a long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to see the picture. If you go on May 1st when the sun comes up, you will see many people from the village dancing around the man on the hill."
KET_61,"Gail Rollins

Gail Rollins is a great runner from Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run 10,000 metres and maybe 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail often came second in big races. She always smiled and laughed, and people in her city love her for this.

In 2004, everything changed. Gail ran her first half-marathon, which is a long race. She won and had the best time of the year for a British woman runner. 

Gail's husband, Mike Rollins, was also a runner when he was younger. But he hurt his right leg and cannot run in races anymore. He can still run a little and sometimes practices with Gail. But it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him.

Gail practices a lot. She runs long in the morning and fast in the afternoon. She always rests from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should eat that?' It is usually cake, but she can eat almost everything."""
KET_52,"**Piano Players - When They Were Young**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. When he was twelve, he studied music in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano, but she taught him and his sister songs. His mother taught him to play the piano when he was six. At ten, he wanted to write music and started his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father taught him some Russian music. At six, he had lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg won prizes for his piano playing. When he was fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Then, he came back to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two. A year later, he started playing the piano. He had his first concert when he was six. At ten, he gave fifty-two concerts in two months in England! Josef liked music, but he also liked physics and languages. He is busy now, but one day he wants to write his own music."
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist. He became a writer of children's books when he was 60 years old. Now, he is 73 and has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. She tells him if she likes it or not. Bill's ten grandchildren do not live close, but they also read his stories and tell him if they are good or bad. 

Bill writes about life in his village and on the farms nearby. His favorite book is called ""The Sheepdog."" It is about a farmer and his dog that helps him. Bill loves animals and thinks dogs are very smart. 

Last year, they made a film of his book with real animals and actors. The people who made the film used special technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. He said, ""Sometimes they change books for the film, but they did not change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"POSTCARDS

Today, people like to send postcards to friends and family. Postcards have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday. Postcards are cheap, and the pictures are often nice.

The first postcard was sent a long time ago, at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed news, like an accident or a visit from an important person. People liked these postcards because newspapers did not have pictures then."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago. This was a long time before people were on Earth. We do not know why they all died. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds.

Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds of dinosaurs. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest dinosaurs were larger than any other land animals. 

For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. It could run fast because it had long back legs."
KET_41,"Bears

Bears can be dangerous. An adult bear is very strong and can hurt a person. Bears can climb trees and run fast. But they do not see well. They find food with their noses.

There are seven types of bears. The biggest is the white polar bear. It can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears. One lives in North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black. They can be dark brown or reddish brown.

Many people love the black and white panda bear. Pandas come from China. There are not many pandas in the forest now because it is hard for them to find food."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm places like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They like to stay in slow water, but they can swim fast and run fast on land. You can see many crocodiles together in groups. They eat fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they can eat big animals or even people.

There are more than ten kinds of crocodiles. All crocodiles have sharp teeth. They can lose their teeth, but they grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are bigger. They can live a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo was 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two brothers from France made the first balloon for people to fly in. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, two brothers named Wright made the first plane with an engine. They flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service.

Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world. It can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours.

Today, many people travel by aeroplane. It is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different. The building was round and had no roof. If it rained, people got cold and wet. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to see plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. Visitors ate food, talked to friends, and walked around during the show. Some people even threw things at the actors!

Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place by the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play or learn about life in the 1600s."
KET_48,"Dear Jeff, 

I am having a nice holiday in Australia. We came here two weeks ago. The weather was bad and cold when we arrived. Now, the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are in Sydney. Next week, we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is warm, and I love swimming there. The fish are many colors: red, yellow, and purple! Australia is very beautiful. We do not want to go home! I will see you at the end of September. 

Sue"
