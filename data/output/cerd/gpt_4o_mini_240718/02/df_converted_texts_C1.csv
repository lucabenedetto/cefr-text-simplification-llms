**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is quite similar. Rubbish bags or bins are regularly picked up by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this system strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, which increases costs for local authorities.

This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling options. However, research by economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman shows that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results.

Their research looked at several American towns that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these tags are collected each week. In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman focused on a program started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 residents. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors found that the benefits of the program did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and managing the program.

Although the number of bags collected fell by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people compacted more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfills. The actual weight of rubbish collected only decreased by 14% in Charlottesville, while in 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5%.

Additionally, some people chose to illegally dump their rubbish instead of paying for collection. Although hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of recycled materials, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, many residents were already participating in a voluntary recycling program.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that while pricing does reduce the amount of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to have a big impact.

This raises the question of whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, wealthier towns tend to produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand these issues, and sometimes the outcomes are not as positive as we hope."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work lives might change in the future. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Simply being successful in your career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even those who are famous often feel bitterness behind their success. Until recently, enjoying your work was enough to be part of a lucky few. Now, you must consider how your job affects you as a person, including your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you dull and unable to connect with others outside your field, or if you are so focused on details that you lack wisdom, imagination, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am trying to find ways for work to prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, help us discover hidden talents, and foster diverse human connections. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. This is too simple a goal because as more people get educated, they seek jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. We should view a lifetime of work as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. Even middle-class professions, like doctors and accountants, are losing their appeal. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence, as a European study shows. Meanwhile, the companies and institutions they work for are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values align with those of their organizations.

I have started a study of various occupations to see how they shape and sometimes harm individuals. I have looked at how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am examining how to find more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on increasing the profits of companies, but we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider the kind of people we want to work with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers as an example, as 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. There is a huge amount of untapped potential. Many intelligent and lively people endure low pay and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz, which had a narrow view of luxury. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they often have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could utilize the knowledge of their student employees instead of assigning them only basic tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 

It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and to move beyond traditional categories. For me, work is about relationships. Many people now want more than just obedience in their jobs; they want to express their independence and personality. They should have the opportunity to design their own roles and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first. While everyone understands the importance of communication, true conversation is different. The kind of conversation people crave today is more intimate, creating a bond of respect and allowing for a deeper understanding of one another. This type of interaction is not just relaxing; it is the most effective way to establish equality. Each meaningful conversation we have can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this agricultural metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the start to be a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

Attempts to create different forms of television organization mostly remained as experiments. However, two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have become in a different social environment. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible alternative to regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. But in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public spaces rather than at home, especially in Britain and Germany.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. However, these systems did not pose a real threat to the rise of domestic television. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most effective way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to more centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable communities.

Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens and helped create a sense of unity within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television. However, it is important to also consider the positive role of broadcasting in supporting democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a possibility that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It’s natural to want to create a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities, often sending the message that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive advertisements constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all urging us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and ecosystems. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature that sparks our curiosity and desire for knowledge, leading to significant research efforts. Their natural presence has been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with a constant stream of weather information almost instantly, while computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-professionals to understand, and it may seem like there is no place for simple weather knowledge. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into accurate weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly about theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the most important part of opera. This makes sense, but I come from a theatre background, where the words and the actors are the main focus. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.

At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the talent of the musicians. A skilled singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music performances is similar to watching athletes compete; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate the skills of actors and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though actors frequently get asked how they memorize their lines. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many people enjoy both. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often connect on a more equal level, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question arises: does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humor, and intimacy. It can also be unpredictable, engaging the audience's imagination both individually and collectively. 

Current music presentation often follows strict rules, such as formal dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, which can create a sense of hierarchy between performers and listeners. On the other hand, contemporary audiences sometimes interrupt performances with applause between movements or after impressive pieces, which, while a genuine expression of appreciation, can disrupt the overall flow of the work.

Is there a solution? Yes, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, the community opera *In Search of Angels*, which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. This experience was not only musically enriching but also transformative for many audience members, who were actively involved in the performance.

What I long for in music is more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, leading to surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in conventional ways, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.

As an enthusiastic supporter of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to flourish and for more people to enjoy the joy I find in being part of the audience."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don’t really like it in its natural form. To me, it feels like an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can even swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you’re wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a powerful hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days, you find it mysteriously appearing on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more comes out when you remove your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.

**Lock and Key**  
The desire for a safe home, privacy, and security has been around since people first built permanent homes. While old wooden beams have been replaced by electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations, the need to keep out intruders remains. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. However, people generally don’t like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, most people prefer the comfort of using a physical key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, art isn’t meant to be understood in a strict way; it should connect with you. This is a great idea, but it hasn’t worked for me in the past. The new gallery tries to give visitors real insight into the meaning behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that provide context and explain what the art is about. Instead of just staring at the pieces as I used to, these helpful details allowed me to understand them better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films often requires cutting down and simplifying the original material. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also provide new insights. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This doesn’t mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary; rather, it reflects how each medium engages the audience differently. 

In novels, ""redundancy"" refers to the repeated mention of character traits and speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help the reader understand better. In dialogue, we can often tell who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to follow. In stage plays, which focus on dialogue, this redundancy mimics real conversation, sometimes to the point where the dialogue seems overly repetitive, serving only to connect the speakers without clear communication.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, viewers can feel completely immersed in the film's world, escaping from reality for the duration of the movie. This experience can make it seem like what happens during the film is not important. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, that illusion is shattered, and we return to our everyday lives. Many people, especially from older generations, viewed movies as mere entertainment rather than art. While they enjoyed being entertained, they did not appreciate films as a serious form of artistic expression.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing mix of buildings. Although there were some recognizable places, like the Script Department, most of the studio consisted of small, similarly furnished rooms. These rooms were used for both official meetings and informal discussions, and they were hard to tell apart, identified only by a strange system of letters and numbers. The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances that did not help visitors find their way. For outsiders, the layout was very confusing, but the employees, who were familiar with the place, managed to navigate it well. Through their teamwork, they created films that allowed audiences to escape from everyday problems and enjoy stories of romance and adventure.

**Film-Makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that reward aspiring filmmakers with equipment, like the camera used by Robert Rodriguez for his film *El Mariachi*, which cost only $7,000 and launched his career. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to achieve his breakthrough film before turning 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills, often working behind the scenes as editors or writers before directing. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to forge their own paths."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western part of the city, forming rows of small, worn-down homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. One common sight in that area of Norwich in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 

There are also other memories, like my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a large mansion in Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling just as alone in a crowded room as she would on a moor. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or her telling me to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I’m not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street. It also meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed. There were many rules and restrictions.

Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Later, I realized how poor their company was. They formed a gloomy group, often talking about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" was resting on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. 

However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a strict routine. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way. I remember long, aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats, which were unusual but helpful. I think my mother let me go with other children from the street for this journey. 

If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was a vague old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity fair at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. However, my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" 

My mother often talked about mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, which I doubt she did, she probably imagined it as a fancy post office where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible citizens. I might be exaggerating and overlooking her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her. 

To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally, on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand in hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn’t completely dislike this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, ""Well, I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I recall my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I would skate or scoot over. 

As the street sloped downwards, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents adapted to these changes and lived with the lingering smells of the goods that used to be sold there.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a former curtain warehouse. His flat has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be moved from trains. However, Gilbert did not want an empty, open space. He found it difficult to separate his living area from his work area in his last home. To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and directed attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 

To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also contains sentimental furniture given to him by his parents or found at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making it a topic of literary discussion. He was a talented and original writer, known for his first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977. This book changed travel writing, combining elements of a thriller, romantic fiction, and deep literary insight. Even in this work, Chatwin blended fact with fiction, often altering reality to enhance his stories. He suggested that through travel, one could uncover rich histories meant to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created small splashes that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain intensified, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. 

In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of my usual swimming routine, which felt like pacing in a cage. 

Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and interpreted, which can make reality feel less genuine. This is why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path and breaking free from the official narratives. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent research suggests he was likely mistaken. Scientists, including psychiatrist John Bowlby, have emphasized the importance of crying in forming the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 

There are also other reasons for crying. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Sometimes, tears come unexpectedly, even when we feel embarrassed, such as when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We often cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research on this topic is ongoing."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people understand the basic idea of global warming, but the specific consequences are less clear. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to grow food, build cities, and support a population of six billion. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising gas levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict the current and future situations accurately.

We know that greenhouse gas levels have varied in close relation to global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models run on powerful computers and use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions for the past, present, and future. However, these models simplify reality and have many limitations. Their predictions are only rough estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, even though we recognize its complexity.

Despite these challenges, most experts agree on one crucial point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs provide some insight into the world we will live in over the next few generations. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by between 1°C and 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15-95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on both the natural environment and human life.

Climate change could alter the locations of ecosystems like forests and grasslands, the variety of species they support, and their ability to provide essential resources for society. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. Many of the effects could be negative and possibly irreversible. However, not all impacts will be harmful. Some scientists have identified positive environmental trends linked to the warming that has already occurred. For instance, in Australia, research shows that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to rising minimum temperatures, which have reduced frost damage to crops.

On the other hand, even small climate changes can affect water availability, either through long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to arise first in dry regions and in areas where demand or pollution have already caused shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades, particularly in western-central areas. In southern Portugal's Alentejo region, rainfall has become more concentrated in autumn and winter, while spring rainfall has decreased.

Another concerning effect of climate change is its impact on glaciers, which will affect ice levels and, in turn, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human infrastructure. There is a strong possibility that the Arctic ice cover will completely melt, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will happen due to the expansion of warmer ocean water and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are likely outcomes, threatening cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. The most severe impacts may be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."
CPE_66,"**Mission to Mars**

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. 

It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft may succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the work done to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable for future missions."
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences, which complicates our understanding.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of certain artworks create established ideas that can block new insights. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When we separate artworks from their origins and their impact on our experiences, we create a barrier that makes it difficult to grasp their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then exists in a separate world, detached from the materials and goals of other human endeavors.

Therefore, anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts faces a significant challenge: to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from human experience.

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion. To truly understand artistic products, we may need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not consider aesthetic. We must take a detour to reach a deeper understanding of art. While it is possible to enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of the interactions between soil, air, water, and sunlight.

To grasp the essence of art, we must start with raw experiences—those moments and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something distant and separate that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 

The arts that resonate most with people today often do not fit the traditional definition of art. For example, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are forms of expression that many people enjoy. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. 

Even those who criticize the museum view of art may still hold onto the mistaken belief that art should be separate from ordinary experiences. The times when people appreciate art the most are when it is closely linked to everyday activities and objects."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

Many people imagine lions hunting as a beautiful display of teamwork. In the fading light of sunset, a group of stealthy lions appears like skilled hunters, surrounding their unsuspecting prey. They seem to be perfect social animals, setting aside their differences to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after years of studying these animals in the wild, we have a different perspective. 

When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping others at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. It has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the direction of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds.

The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as clever songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the true strength of the album lay in its deeper, more emotional tracks, such as ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, making it an outstanding record in an era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who had great influence in ancient times. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life.

As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the opportunity to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. I’m mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these submissions is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally looking for something original— the junior hopes to make a name for themselves, while the freelancer wants to justify their job.

If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor who supports your novel must explain why it deserves to be accepted based on its quality and potential sales. They also need to consider whether you, as an author, seem like a long-term investment, which you should have assured them of in your letter. Additionally, they will evaluate how marketable you are, as this is crucial for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in the economy, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, job losses for over half a million people, and many homes being repossessed. Every business was impacted, with some sectors, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in activity. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.

While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt intense pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies improve their financial performance, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they had to manage increasingly difficult tasks with shrinking budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. 

As a result, marketing activities started to receive more attention from management, leading to a better understanding of the field and some brands being effectively marketed. This shift raised the status of marketing professionals but also increased their workload. Marketing began to be viewed as a solution to many problems, even though it is not a guaranteed fix. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals intensified. 

The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the early 1990s marked a significant downturn for the industry. This decline was partly due to the economic situation, but deeper changes were also occurring. The recession led clients to reassess their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies struggled to see the return on their advertising investments, making them skeptical about its value. 

As a result, clients demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best talent working on their accounts and expected outstanding results. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for advertising professionals, it highlights that they faced the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

Several factors made effective advertising even harder to produce. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising regulations. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising in foreign markets.

These issues, combined with the economic climate, forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" The pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising has never been greater. Unfortunately, support for those looking to improve their advertising strategies is not readily available. Companies and agencies have been too busy managing these challenges to share their experiences, and those who have succeeded often keep their strategies private. 

While conferences and seminars may offer some insights, the available literature on advertising often fails to provide practical guidance. Many books treat the advertising process with excessive reverence, suggesting that the work produced by agencies is always of high quality and value, which is not the case. This misconception does not help the employees at client companies who are ultimately responsible for the outcomes."
CPE_18,"**The Allure of Cooking**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This choice was unusual among my peers, as cooking was not a popular career. Many saw it as an unattractive profession. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university; the studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected my appreciation for beauty in food. This appreciation began when I had a meal at a well-known restaurant in London. It was a life-changing experience. I still remember my starter vividly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to kneel and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This inspired me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The swimming instructor at my school was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he instructed me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly, saying things like, ""Don't look down, look up!"" and ""Keep your legs straight!"" 

The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I landed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disappointment, but even he couldn't take away my joy. I thought to myself, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveler**

For those of us who value comfort, safety, and the likelihood of living a long life, the idea of a traveler can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats in rough seas, and eating whatever they can find, even if it’s not appetizing. They can live for months in uncertainty, always seeking the unknown. 

It’s easy to see these travelers as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we often dismiss it as irrelevant. We can simply return to our comfortable lives, grateful that our risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is likely why he spends so much time on it. He doesn’t claim to be an expert sailor, but he is skilled. As a writer, he enjoys sailing because it gives him stories to tell. His small boat has a device that shows his exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass harmed the connection between humans and the sea. 

Raban argues that since the compass was invented, sailors have focused too much on it and not enough on understanding the ocean. The sea, once full of life and activity, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, a sailor can often rely on autopilot, which may be why Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in classic books from the past or from different cultures because there are more similarities among people than differences. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, feelings, and struggles. Authors can express emotions we thought we were alone in feeling, using words that capture our experiences with clarity and insight. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly articulated by them, which is even more impressive if the author is from a distant place or a different time. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves better.

Through reading and traveling, we break free from our daily routines. Our awareness is heightened when we first arrive in a new place, just as it is when we read a great book that reveals things we might have overlooked before. Our minds become more alert, noticing the colors of the sky, the expressions on faces, the insincerity of friends, or a sadness we didn’t realize we felt. 

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to restore parts cut by the editor for space, but I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only minor details that I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have been endless. For instance, in my second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer reflect my thoughts at that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in the moment, unaware of what would happen next, focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the essence of modern air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it, except for the price of a ticket. However, I believe my fellow travelers were not completely unaware. Even a simple postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism terms that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first place. This term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their trips would not harm the places they visited. It quickly became a popular marketing term for vacations. Today, ""ecotourism"" can refer to anything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour boat ride through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful natural sites, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of clear regulations and definitions has left many travelers confused in the ecotourism landscape.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I was lucky to find it a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier experience than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another and often staying for weeks. When I settled in during these long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only made brief notes instead of detailed accounts. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded those sections with many qualifications. However, I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I decided to let the story unfold naturally without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought to be a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace its beginnings to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for creating various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more intricate and significant. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly represents today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writer**

Media reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. In my experience, which is far from being at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that provide security, even if their books are not quickly published or made into films. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, conducting workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Nevertheless, by balancing part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the kindness of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not performing, it was hard to leave home without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only those who are usually shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advancements are changing our lives in many areas, including music. Susan Hallam examines how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a significant increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this growth has led to a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians.

It is clear that access to music will keep expanding, as it meets many human needs. Music is essential for national events and offers many activities for individuals, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether music will exist in the 21st century, but what type of music it will be and whether people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments.

I believe there will still be a strong interest in learning instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, research shows that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Studies in the USA suggest that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, a measure of intelligence. Although these findings need further confirmation, other European studies indicate that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to better study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Therefore, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

Looking further ahead, will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres emerging that blend different styles. Second, technology will play a larger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages may want to engage in music-making, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions. If this future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to adapt to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and assessment methods to stay relevant for a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be essential. They must learn to motivate and teach students of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and community management. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 

Positively, this change offers a chance for those in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to elevate the importance of music in our lives, as it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should collaborate to ensure that music receives the recognition it deserves."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and disdain, often fueled by their own words during interviews about their craft. Instead of sharing deep insights, they often resort to clichés or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote that an actor's work is most alive when performed, but loses its essence when discussed. He believed that acting has no strict rules, except perhaps for being heard. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the playwright. After a performance, they often feel empty until the next role, and this emptiness is evident in discussions about their work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the character's transition from boyhood to manhood with simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays Hamlet as a young man filled with anger, yet he balances this with sharp wit and humor, making him both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force, both known and unknown.

**What is Acting?**

This raises the question: What is acting? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it evoke something deeper? What gives life to these characters, both morally and physically? This is a fundamental question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

One director's rehearsal method is called ""dropping in."" In this process, the stage manager displays the script on a screen while actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, if the line is about queuing in the rain, they might visualize a memory related to that experience. The director encourages actors to be open-minded and trust that something will emerge naturally during the rehearsal.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make the audience feel their presence matters. Attending a live performance should feel special, and the staff should share this sense of importance. It can be alienating if the front-of-house staff seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between performers and the audience, ensuring that everyone feels engaged and not distanced from the action on stage. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If the space feels too large, it detracts from the experience. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century successfully created an intimate atmosphere that embraces the stage. I appreciate theatres that carry a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, reflecting layers of human experience. 

When it comes to plays, it’s impossible to please everyone. You cannot predict what an audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older generations. This genre opened doors for future rock stars, who listened to it with admiration, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show became essential listening for a whole generation of aspiring rock stars. Just like young John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.

**Snow**

I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I struggled on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way beneath me, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**

Many books now offer guidance for researchers on qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of confusion about how researchers go about analyzing their findings. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insights into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves clarifying the hidden steps in the analysis process. Although this may seem easy, we found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur, pulling the noodles up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. When I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, he didn’t remember much. There is a current trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this method effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning is more effective in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. While using new technology to teach children is fine, traditional education still plays a crucial role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film production had moved to Hollywood. The local residents were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles taken over by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, measured by box office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a century, Hollywood transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to reach the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films: how much they earn, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Many successful people try to escape the area, working there but living elsewhere. Still, it remains the main destination for anyone important in show business.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and light-sensitive surfaces produced images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in a long time. This innovation surprised other artists, and while some initially enjoyed the new images, critics soon claimed that photography could not be considered art. They argued that photography was too reliant on reality and mechanical processes to be a true expression of creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new art form. They used their tools to interpret the world, presenting their vision of nature, objects, and people.

**Book Illustration**

During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was widely accepted that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to novels for older readers, although the number of illustrated books decreased over time. Children's publishing remained active, but it was often low-budget, leading to many average-quality works, even though the best artists always submitted their finest work. As a result, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less impressive pieces, making it a great resource for research and exploration. The true treasures from this period are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this artistic period is growing, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""I'm here,"" you are also revealing your location to many people, some of whom you might not want to meet. This highlights a growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative consequences. 

The internet offers exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this digital world, we often share personal stories and photos without realizing the risks involved. It can feel overwhelming and unsafe, but there is hope. We can learn from those who explored the internet before us—early bloggers who faced many challenges and learned valuable lessons.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a blog filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. By January 1996, he began posting daily, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything, and while some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the artistic side of his work.

However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video titled ""Dark Night."" Hall revealed that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to remove the blog, expressing that sharing his life online made people distrust him. This situation raises an important point: while sharing online can be enjoyable, it can also lead to disappointment if you expect it to bring you closer to others.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague shared her blog's address with the company's executives, including those she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. This situation illustrates what experts call the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary tale about the risks of sharing online, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life wisely. 

Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: the internet allows us to say anything, but that doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. This growing interest in sleep focuses on its patterns, benefits, and the problems people face with it. A leading sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a significant need for rest that they had been missing.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a large screen. Participants are asked to arrive at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions, facing a bright, endless road. Many young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has recorded one participant trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more frequently and nod off. Eventually, he falls asleep briefly, causing the car to drift off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

Despite these findings, there is still much uncertainty about sleep. It is known that humans, like other mammals, follow a daily sleep cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. There are theories that sleep helps repair the body, restore muscles, or rest the part of the brain responsible for speech and creativity, but it is unclear if these processes happen faster during relaxed wakefulness.

Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, although the reasons for this are unknown. Some researchers describe sleep in grand terms, saying, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm.""

Historically, sleep patterns were different. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This break allowed time for reflection, remembering dreams, or even nighttime activities. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daytime struggles. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making most people work longer hours in lit buildings.

In many non-Western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The idea of a solid night's sleep is not universal. In some tribal societies, sounds from humans and animals, along with the need to tend to fires and watch for dangers, make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people everywhere are in great need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about very expensive cowboy boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert. Money was not a concern. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might be seen as a cowboy. But I was not one. I realized that I did not belong there. As I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains, I had to admit that I was not at home in the wild. 

I had flown in from Denver just after dawn, feeling like I could pass for a cowboy arriving from the sky. However, that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a worn canvas bag when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and left without saying anything. 

I thought there should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. Something that would make me feel comfortable wherever I went, without the feeling that everyone else was moving at a slower pace. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. It was my passion, but I no longer do it. I couldn't even if I wanted to. 

I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other identities ready for when they stop racing. I thought I had some options, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. I considered becoming a commentator for races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me for that job. I also thought about starting a business selling classic cars, but that plan fell through because no one was buying old Ferraris that year. Eventually, I stepped back from that idea before it became a bigger problem. 

Being an ""ex"" anything can be disheartening. Who really wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to listen for a few minutes before losing interest. Last year's champion is just that—last year. 

I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a successful career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into a powerful racing car, feeling the speed of zero to one hundred fifty miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who treated my words as important. Being somewhat famous had its perks; businessmen and politicians would brag about knowing me, and young fans would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 

Now that I no longer race, my life feels empty. Just last week, my phone rang twice, and I realized I have a lot of free time. I looked up at the clear blue sky, and there were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I noticed some small brown birds in a cactus nearby, warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots still has much to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents enjoy walking through the streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

As a journalist, I often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it’s more about how we aim for the best impact in our work, which makes writing a letter feel less spontaneous. True artists, who may rewrite their work many times, do not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful, even though it showed his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, making celebrity appearances less necessary. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, when a new Superbuy branch opened, the waiting customers didn’t care who the guest was, as long as they were at the front of the line. A rumor spread that the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news created a sense of pride among those at the front and jealousy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the possible negative reaction from William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite this, the film received very positive reviews. It was television that later brought the film back into the public eye. *Citizen Kane* is often seen as the film that has motivated many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went ahead and created it. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who resembled Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he approached the project with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t really understand. “Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost a waste to spend the day doing nothing.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature often leads to amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overshadows our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually my main reason for being anywhere. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I was always inspired by how light fell on different surfaces. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I lived by the idea that I could take the perfect picture at any moment, as long as I had film in my camera. My motto was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my approach for a long time.

Once, I had a brief moment of fame when a photo I took of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was mostly luck, but they say you create your own opportunities, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life took some unexpected turns, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting location. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I didn’t mind.

This assignment came about by chance. I had previously taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showcasing the beauty of daffodils in Hyde Park and the busy atmosphere of Piccadilly. However, I knew that much of my work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.

After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the chance to take his place. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna sounded like a welcome change.

They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy summer trip with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It had been hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather felt different. I could tell from the moment I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs that I was going to enjoy this trip and take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to let it reveal itself to me. 

A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The overnight snow made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral, which towered high into the grey sky but appeared massive at ground level. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early pioneers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper transform into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed from a serious space into one filled with wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget event, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been an important, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 

Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for many years, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it focuses on themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments that make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks serious purpose? 

Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. Yet, one could argue that his popularity today is seen as a negative rather than a reflection of his work's quality. Hockney himself is realistic about his abilities and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly assess his significance.

**Window-Shopping: An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, however, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced idea. 

As a curator, I wanted to create a show that opposed this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse for an exhibition called ""Window-Shopping."" This was meant to showcase individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera as he opened it and poked around until it broke, creating a flickering display on a monitor. 

These pieces did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but I believe they complemented each other through their differences. While I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, I think it is important to recognize that art is often a personal activity where artists define their own boundaries.

**Art History**

People who appreciate paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of simply looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. 

Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our enjoyment is complex. How we respond to art is influenced by our senses and is shaped by the values of the society we live in. 

While it is essential to value our instinctive reactions to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as a substitute for thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow pebble and picked it up. This pebble did not feel like stone, but it was beautiful. This could be how gold first became important to primitive people. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which added to the skills that helped our ancestors improve their lives.

**St Ives**  
We struggled to carry our bags down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center, trying to stay upright against the strong wind and avoiding the icy waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and every cottage by the water had its shutters tightly closed against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark skies above, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to join me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced conflict and drought are no longer alive. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot rewind time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these digital cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys and observed the dominant male noticing a strange male nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which would likely lead to the dominant male losing his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervets use to warn of a leopard. This caused the stranger to retreat back into the trees. This tactic worked several times until the dominant male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while casually walking across the open ground, which confused the situation.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that this means cats in Britain kill around 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey shows that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, who care for them deeply. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping near their owners, slowly make their way to the distant reed beds. They often groan about their tiredness before finally moving into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are so slow that they go almost unnoticed. Eventually, they swim, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles. Despite being on the slab, the fish look alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater feel. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including the scales and a chain around one fish, add a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been a powerful tool for capturing all aspects of human life. This relatively short history has seen photography develop its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both the vast and the tiny. It has provided images from faraway places, distant parts of our solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest forms of visual recording date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We may not know the exact reasons for early cave paintings—whether they depicted real hunting events, served as magic to attract animals, had religious significance, or were simply made for decoration—but these images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise an automatic way to create truthful records. The camera was seen as a tool that worked like the human eye, capturing images that closely resembled what we see in reality. The chemical process used in photography allowed for the preservation of these images, which were considered a natural phenomenon.

At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long struggled to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. In 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late 20th century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural boundaries. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as other forms of communication, like language? Has our familiarity with photographs led us to overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? 

Photography is often seen as a convincing form of evidence, making it easy to confuse our perception of the world with its photographic representations. For example, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For instance, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without acknowledging how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, one wrong move can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best advice is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow. Eventually, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify a point. One effective way to include a flashback is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward without slowing it down. Dialogue is also very useful; it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Avoiding excessive writing is crucial, but being concise doesn’t mean the story should feel incomplete. A short story should maintain conflict and action just like a novel, but every word must be meaningful in the limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Many chess players make mistakes throughout the game. We may not know exactly what will happen next, but we can anticipate a few moves ahead. As we improve, we start to understand that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. We begin to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies, such as openings and end games. The more we practice, the more we understand the complexities of both chess and screenplay writing.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally communicate, as seen in how children speak. However, writing is not an instinct. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a human trait, written language is not. All societies have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily become better. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but learning to write is a skill that requires effort and practice. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don’t know what else to name it. I have a small story to share, and it doesn’t end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my readers hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I only met occasionally, and I don’t know much about his life in between our meetings. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I don’t want to do that. I just want to write down what I know.

To protect the identities of living people, I have given the characters in this story made-up names and taken care to ensure they cannot be recognized. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water’s surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it’s possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character could influence others, and long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life may find useful information in my book.

I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be helpful for those writing about my friend. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians do by creating dialogues for characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be dull if simply told. I want my book to be engaging, and I think it’s reasonable to do what I can to achieve that. A thoughtful reader will notice where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.

Another reason I feel uneasy about this work is that the people I focus on come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know someone, and I believe we can only fully understand our own countrymen. People are shaped not just by themselves but also by their birthplace, their childhood experiences, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, and the literature they read. These experiences shape who they are, and you can only understand them if you have lived through similar experiences. Since you can only know people from a different nation through observation, it is challenging to portray them convincingly in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen, and when I have written about others in short stories, it was easier to give broad descriptions and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are viewed, like my main character, through my perspective."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Currently, there is a complex mix of different styles of poetry, various groups of poets, and differing opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 

A major discussion in contemporary poetry is the tension between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community spaces or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to share their work with students, and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.

The impact of these events on poets is varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live performances, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be easily understood in one listening. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique may become apparent.

On the other hand, dedicated poets, who strive to create deep and meaningful work, may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best writing.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to focus their attention. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may be communicated to the informant. Therefore, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from their childhood. The emotions and attitudes expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may actually reflect later experiences rather than the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors in wild animals. Although these distinctions still exist, there is now a productive blending of the two fields. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior itself, which has its own structure and units. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize that knowledge. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own set of concepts. These basic ideas form the ""logical basis"" of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures were not artistic, they contributed essential elements that influenced later architectural concepts. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, even jumping over a small bridge, which was her only mistake. Afterward, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that Lily was driving without telling him. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early and returning by noon to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the way, Lily overtook some slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her comments. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with its small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street with many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk a fine or being towed. She hoped this carefulness would ease Mui's worries. 

While driving, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror. She thought it best not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked them carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were offended. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to see the grey sea. He held his son close and thought about how he would raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to have a good education, especially in numbers, and to own many restaurants one day.

As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and hope while planning for Man Kee's future. He noticed smoke on the horizon and then saw a ship shining in the sunlight. He put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. After some effort, he finally spotted it—a small, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special ship for us. It's small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily with a view of seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I once read that if you dig deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, balanced it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t consider how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket away from the well's edge. As soon as it was free, I fell straight down. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I landed in the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, confusing and odd. Later, I connected these lights to the cartoon stars I had seen when characters got hurt. At first, I felt dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall, worried about what Mother would say.

You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. After a moment, I quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. Mother and Father arrived with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I hid in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. A small pool of water formed at my feet. I glanced back at the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had noticed them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but things had become more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank quickly turned into a situation that would lead to serious consequences, likely for me.

I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my clever plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, an idea came to me like a lifeline. I gathered my courage and stepped out of my hiding place, staggering and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then dramatically fell onto the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was covering up a mistake, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life.

Looking into my father's eyes felt like staring into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how adults view the world and the lies children tell. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, his tone full of contempt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his face showing regret and concern. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my desperate lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, even more painful than my father's words. It made me realize that this was the adult judgment of my actions, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The moving van was labeled 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed all the fragile items with his large hands, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he once was, especially now that he was helping with the move and making sure Susan didn’t mention the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, being bossy and insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan was not crying. ""That's something,"" he said. ""Do people cry?"" Susan asked, curious. ""You'd be surprised,"" Fred replied. ""They seem happy while packing, but then they start crying in an empty room. They’re fine once they get to the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan could understand that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano was now the last item to be moved, standing proudly in the best room of the house.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, trying to get it up. Little Robert watched in fascination while Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture, which was much less back then. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from a local farmer, and the piano was carefully lifted through the window while the excited children danced with joy. However, it cost so much that they couldn’t afford to have it tuned for months. ""That’s there forever,"" Peter had said. But forever is a long time. The children were now too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house.

Thinking about the stairs made her realize the banister rails were still not perfectly aligned from that day long ago. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late now. Any moment, they would discover the piano. Feeling dazed and anxious, she looked around. ""Are you okay?"" Fred asked. ""Just the piano left, and then we’ll be done."" She stepped away from the stairs, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. Truthfully, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless other items that seemed unimportant before now felt full of emotion, and she felt she might cry.

Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What’s so funny?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was to make information accessible to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that truly opened up to the public: literary criticism. 

By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions and rate books with up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it meant that readers could see reviews from other readers, not just professional critics. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically, giving Amazon free content and helping potential buyers make informed choices.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical locations, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This popularity led to many reviews being submitted daily, making it hard for Amazon to check them all. A team of editors monitored the site to ensure reviews followed the rules, such as not allowing one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to misuse the system. For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. 

One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive ones under a fake name to balance things out. His trick worked until he revealed it in an article, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon did not always verify that these comments were genuine. 

The situation became more complicated with reader reviews. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from critics, but many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared quickly. Despite this, Amazon saw the high level of engagement from readers as beneficial for business. 

Amazon monitored reviews closely, especially for bestsellers, to ensure they followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping* inspired humorous reviews that compared its plot to Internet technology. However, most reviews on Amazon were serious and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying.

The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have genuine feelings about them. This highlights the importance of allowing everyone to participate in the review process, which can be a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often reflects this sentiment, and we tend to agree because we expect art to constantly surprise us. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes and techniques that are still present in modern art.

We expect artists to be different from ordinary people, possessing special talents and energy that break free from conventions. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and often become frustrated if they try to connect with the public.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist selects a text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes that there are countless types of pictures. This may seem simplistic, but bear with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in a straightforward manner, without any decorative elements. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in simple black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: is this final product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it is often met with disappointment. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer to take safe risks, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different, and it will be interesting to see if he succeeds. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world, resulting in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the intriguing atmosphere of this hidden world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only someone unwell would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I suppose I am here to heal. Besides an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I exist in a state of reflection. I mentioned the futility of art but did not express its comforting aspects. The true comfort of my work lies in the ability to reshape reality through art. Our everyday actions often hide deeper meanings, like a rough cloth covering something beautiful. For artists, art offers a joyful way to confront the struggles of daily life, allowing us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we cause each other pain?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Listen, this isn't good!"" my dad said. We were driving back to London. He had just picked me and my trunk up from the fancy girls' school I attended, after sitting through Parent's Day. I had received the Latin prize and the award for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking since he was unusually quiet. Normally, he was very talkative. ""You can't trick me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Wouldn't that be useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister, of all things!"" My dad knew a lot about barristers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I’m not so sure about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV dramas."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn't in the family business anymore. Clearly, you'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 

The problem was, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by my family's expectations. I saw many career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my dad. I wasn't as scared of him as my brother Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 

""It's too early to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my dad said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent—the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My dad scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my dad had raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and since he was motherless, I had taken care of him from an early age. It wasn't a burden; I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My dad knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and businesspeople—and our home was always lively with great conversations.

""I have an idea,"" my dad said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my dad would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 

So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my dad came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left until my exams. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 

But then my dad told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important for me to do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell my dad didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined he was—the clarity and energy he brought to his work were impressive. In his own way, he was a genius, and I admired that in him. It made my own dreams seem less significant. 

""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning a home that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At the time, however, it seemed like a smart and appealing choice. Simon had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly pushed for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate area for an au pair. They could have found these in a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel it lowered her social and economic status.

Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of resentment and negative thoughts. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a boy, remembering the comforting smells of dinner and his grandmother's care for her husband after a long day in court. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and present at all lawyer events, seemingly happy with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which depended on two incomes.

Now, their hard work was at risk because of Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and it was clear she was furious. He regretted being in his room; if he had left earlier, their confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think things over. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. She had defended Brian Cartwright that day, who claimed that when Simon was his lawyer four years ago, he knew about jury bribing and did nothing. Simon denied it, but his response felt weak even to him. He felt guilty, and the shameful memories of his headmaster's punishments flooded back. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief and contempt.

He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. He just wants attention."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who made Venetia the judge of their legal practice? Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,"I chose to live in this place because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t mind the worn-out condition of rented houses or messy gardens. However, I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their lives, soon start to recognize me. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and rooftops. I have trimmed some rosemary and lemon balm to make room for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It’s a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive.

“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to discuss them as part of my job as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “Honestly, in no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies, her voice trailing off before she continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 

“So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you,” she says, lounging in shorts and a tank top while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should’ve become a teacher—writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days, hot sidewalks covered in melted gum, the walk to the shops, and the lonely park bench.

“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats while I’m gone?” My heart races as I ask. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy B&B?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. “Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I have barely read. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always delivering gifts to others and returning her manuscripts in silly bags.

Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little advice,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student ready to defend her work. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day, no matter how small.” My words sound a bit pretentious. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen offers a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. 

In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, modern society has disrupted many communities and families, leading to a loss of this oral tradition. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our past. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens appealing because they seemed like a flat and empty backdrop for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are uniquely English yet also strangely captivating. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find oddly foreign, especially since many other distinct areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. 

While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict factual evidence. However, trying to envision the Fens has its own logic, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work, which suggests that the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should offer more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, this idea has expanded to help elderly people with memory loss.

Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that museums uniquely offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve our surroundings is not new, but the rapid changes in our towns affect everyone. This can lead some people to become passionate preservationists while encouraging others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily negative if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you stop anyone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thought, a revolution that marked the beginning of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to develop a new, more logical way to describe the universe by examining the connections between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basic concepts of time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier theories were based on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein challenged this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

As children, Lydia and I were skeptical of any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother often criticized our lack of appreciation for serious literature, while our father would happily give us small coins for each chapter we read from more challenging books. He would also include a few better books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, clearly marked with the note, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter, quality fiction and, on one occasion, to a well-known collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous.' This mystery has led to many unusual theories. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is quite sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands filled with wild animals might have made desperate noises, and some words in our languages still reflect this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". Because of such strange ideas, many people avoided discussing the topic, seeing it as a place for odd theories. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become an important area of research. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power dynamics. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who practices it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including the writers themselves, believe that reviewing is not a desirable job and is often done out of necessity, like needing extra money or because one cannot spend all day working on a novel or serious book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review of fifteen hundred words in a weekly magazine combines challenges from both short and long formats. Reviewers must consider their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.

Additionally, a reviewer needs to have a broad knowledge base and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. This often means that reviewers are also writers of other types of work. For example, the American novelist John Updike, who is somewhat critical of criticism, still engages in reviewing while writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how brief, into books with modest titles.

Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they want to preserve their work and take pride in it, especially if they feel their best writing is hidden in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own work. My main focus has been academic writing, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.

In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The past criticism from other academics towards professors who review has diminished, as has the concern from non-professors that professors are taking opportunities away from them. This change is partly due to the increase in reviewing opportunities, allowing more people to participate, and because the rewards for reviewing are often minimal.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and professors can maintain their sanity through this work. It also serves as a reminder for professors to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may feel the need to use complex language among themselves, they should strive to be understandable when addressing a broader audience.

Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary activity. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in another primary occupation."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes hit him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come back eagerly, curious about what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming space where he could focus without distractions. He knew he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, reflecting either independence or neglect, depending on how tidy he had left it.

Over time, Ralph began to see the flat as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something did happen.

From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a sense of himself returning during his bus ride, but he still struggled with the need for solitude. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his belongings, but once he escaped, he felt empty and lost. He suspected that the unfulfilling work he did had changed him, distancing him from who he believed he was.

As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he often questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, but he had been so eager to find something meaningful that he followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.

After university, he had tried to create a plan for a better life, but he was not surprised to find that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, trailing behind them as they moved forward, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He attended one interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he was offered the job on the spot, learning that he was the only graduate who had applied. At the time, Ralph took this as a compliment, though he didn’t fully understand what it meant for his future."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was set up as a course for the goats. It wasn’t as formal as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was challenging, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there were no places to stop. We hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs, and our flashlight batteries were dying. We replaced the batteries, but they didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light turned out to be moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stand still as we continued on.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone in this. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the beginning. Start with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they require their own time. For example, if you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different modes of thinking work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds in the mind. 

The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For instance, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body and mind quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. This quick response can be called our ""wits."" 

The second speed involves actual thinking, where we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical, deliberate thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed, playful, or dreamy. In this mode, we reflect or contemplate. For example, sitting on a rock by the sea, lost in thought, is different from planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster ones. Allowing our minds to wander is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need this ""tortoise mind"" as much as the ""hare brain."" 

Some everyday problems are better approached with a slow mind. Complex situations often require a relaxed, open attitude. Research shows that patient, less deliberate thinking is particularly effective for understanding complicated or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems, like planning a holiday. But when the situation is unclear or subtle, we need to use our tortoise mind. 

For example, if we are trying to manage a difficult team at work or deciding whether to change careers, it may be wiser to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and have sought to develop these slower, deeper ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower modes of thought. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can accomplish many complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complicated situations, and resolve difficult issues more effectively than our active intellect."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, and weather experts, all living in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but I struggle with casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful during breakfast. While this is not a practical problem, it did affect my self-confidence at first. I felt nervous about mealtimes, unsure of which table to choose, and I was anxious when I spoke. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think my occasional sadness comes from losing the social confidence I used to have.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he didn’t pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and would greet me politely when we met, but he didn’t seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he didn’t care about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, no matter their cultural background. He thought that if a film is made well, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock was very clear and logical in his self-assessment. He was a rational man and a brilliant craftsman who loved to see audiences react strongly. He didn’t engage in speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn’t explore his characters deeply. His focus was on film itself and the precise, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. The telescopes were basic, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have greatly improved the production of almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and create clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, people face ""overchoice."" There are too many things to do and too many options available. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this constant change. New products appear quickly, and just as you get used to one, another one is launched. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in our economy, having too many options can cause stress, take up time, and create complexity. As a result, many people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a world filled with excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and plans to choose from.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a unique group of guests at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants that is often mistaken for equality today. I also find it annoying when waiters act overly friendly, as if they are trying too hard to be casual. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, without any need for deeper conversation. This respect for personal space and dignity is rare in today’s commercial world."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I unfairly judged his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona distorts the tragedy, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. The entire cast is impressive. Notable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers spiral out of control, and the moment when Iago starts to lose his composure and struggles to regain control. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life cannot survive. The exception is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms may exist there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers worldwide have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard an interesting discussion on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to become scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the quest for knowledge drives us, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. However, these scientists want to understand why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this motivation. I believe it is more important to focus on whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in discussions about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boil them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-made one. Instead of purchasing a sugary chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your creations, no matter how simple. Food has deep meaning in our lives, which is why we celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary, nor would anyone want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still scattered everywhere. Tax forms and other documents were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were only close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very punctual and neat. He wondered how she would react to the mess; she might think someone had broken in. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in after her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But her expression was cold, and she seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not someone who belonged to her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire inspired her to create her own story, one that emphasized her uniqueness and strength. In her personal narrative, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At that moment, she feared she would go blind. Fortunately, her bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, leaving her with just a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, Karen realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was hurrying back to her work across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is thrilling to be the first to learn something important, especially in a small community where life can be quiet. However, she was also deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's health issues. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health concerns. Miss Fogerty valued Dr. Bailey's ability to make her feel like there was always enough time to talk about her worries. This quality made him beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, which earned him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist, but she has also started writing books for young children who are learning to play the piano. Her performances are exciting and impressive, showcasing her incredible skill on the piano. Recently, during a concert for kids, a small boy asked her if she could play the theme from ""Match of the Day."" This request surprised many experienced musicians, but Joanna found it amusing. She realized that, in the boy's eyes, she needed to play that piece to be considered a true pianist.

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn music. Despite her packed schedule, she has published a beginner's piano book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" This summer, she is involved in many music festivals and collaborations, and she runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She loves working with other artists and often suggests new projects.

She believes that the early lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on training exceptional talent, but Joanna thinks that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. She wants to make music accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill level. 

Joanna has experience teaching beginners, as she taught many children piano between the ages of 18 and 25. Growing up, she was surrounded by children of all backgrounds who wanted to play different types of music. She believes that just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, everyone should have the chance to learn the piano.

Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage of learning. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on television. Joanna worries that some parents use music as a way to push their children to achieve, rather than letting them enjoy it. She thinks that children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.

When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good enough, Joanna is careful not to criticize them. She acknowledges that her books are colorful and engaging, but they are not the only ones available to help beginners enjoy learning. To make her books appealing, she includes stories and music on CDs that accompany the lessons. This way, learning becomes fun and interesting.

As children progress, they face new challenges, such as learning to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear when she was younger. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. She encourages children to play pieces multiple times and to set clear goals for their practice sessions. 

Joanna admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a challenging repertoire. Now, she enjoys practicing for eight hours a day, which she considers essential to her musical life. She empathizes with those who find practice difficult and believes it is a common issue that is not discussed enough. 

To make practice effective, she suggests planning what to focus on, rewarding yourself by playing through pieces, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent writing by hand. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. While many love letters are now sent via email, they can feel less personal. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Quick, typed messages can lack the thoughtfulness and personality of handwritten notes.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and went to look at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed the disc to him carefully. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be playable to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point. He said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. However, they overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations. This attitude is called chronocentricity, the belief that our generation is at a crucial point in history. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly fade away. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often frustrating, so many people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some tech enthusiasts argue that this quick reading leads to new storytelling forms, but non-linear reading is not new. Many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a text in its entirety.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and found a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the papers that had once covered it, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their correct drawers, and twelve years' worth of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room's antique furniture. He couldn't imagine a computer or any mechanical device in this space, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-mode giftedness, inspired by her. She could easily manipulate software to create something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he usually wasn't supposed to be there. However, he had started coming in all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker trying to keep everything from falling apart, struggling to find parking when he arrived at the office.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot felt uneasy about the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn't want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. He was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty and unconvincing. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter for payments that were never given. In Ian's case, he had received a huge advance, which went against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge, a place full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. Even at the height of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he wasted the budget for many issues without producing anything. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which increased in an attempt to make him produce more, and then even more to get him to produce anything at all.

At editorial meetings, where famous photographers were always present, Ian would criticize others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the very beginning."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively recent development in England. You rarely find mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. There are some references to travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and to sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone, not just the wealthy. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they often overlook other significant social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal first thing in the morning became necessary and was no longer just a sign of social status."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural norms. Throughout this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an instinctive understanding of the photographs in the paper. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly represents the scene as it appeared at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured the most important part, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a larger situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. To succeed in sports, you need to focus intensely and prioritize your goals. The path to being the best is challenging, and you must be prepared to make sacrifices. Sport is competitive, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life—while you can achieve personal success, you should always remember the people around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just financially. It has opened many opportunities for me and allowed me to see parts of the world that others may never experience. However, you also have to give up a lot to enjoy these benefits.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories in our minds. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird hidden in a tall tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in a surprising artistic experience. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an incredible live performance filled with stunning improvisation. I reacted with joy and excitement as each unexpected musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds, whether we love, fear, or admire them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of important messages or omens. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my understanding, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Although some old beliefs may have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and lacking. 

This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, which reflects how people once understood the world around them. In the past, when survival depended more on nature, people developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, cultural changes can alter how we view these animals. 

For example, the red kite was once admired in London for its ability to take food from children. Over time, it became seen as a pest and nearly disappeared from many areas, except for Wales. Recently, red kites have been celebrated again as symbols of conservation, and efforts have been made to reintroduce them to their former habitats. 

Our bond with birds goes back to our early human history. The first birdwatchers likely paid close attention to birds because they signaled danger, weather changes, and food availability. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The concepts of flight, song, and freedom reflect our own identity in relation to nature. 

Some may think these feelings are outdated, remnants of our past. However, like certain body parts that we no longer need, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be difficult. This is why birds have become symbols of environmental change, serving as indicators of ecological health. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered, which is troubling not only because we are losing these beautiful creatures but also because it represents a significant cultural loss. 

Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent different kinds of love and magic. Readers of poets like Shelley and Shakespeare feel a sense of loss for these once-common birds. Yet, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 

Folklore is crucial. The stories and legends that have survived through time create a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms do. This connection evokes emotions and attitudes that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, our experiences with birds cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to express, and the stories we tell about them help us understand what they might be communicating. 

The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me intrigued."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The main purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between different points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions were more about how easy it was to travel through the local terrain rather than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the key questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written directions were just as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always represent true directions.

Initially, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their significance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the content of maps. To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.

As exploration expanded our understanding of the world, astronomers found that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas. The needs of map users also changed significantly. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, required accurate maps to understand the terrain for military purposes. This need led to the creation of contour maps. Later, archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers each had their own specific mapping needs.

Today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival in cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of mapping has not always been smooth. There have been times of stagnation and periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for advancements but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it is easier to create a map by copying an existing one, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted new ideas, maps should not be blindly accepted as accurate representations of current knowledge and techniques.

The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide an invaluable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's drawing room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. In this room, I saw the largest collection of records I had ever encountered, the first stereo record player and tuner I had seen, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. This teenager was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as crucial to me as Andrew's were to him. If I had failed, it might have felt like a big deal, but I was able to say that now. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for his work. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my genuine praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written that an unknown pop group had recorded, which had not helped their struggling career. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre very soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs. 

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that mimicked musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. Soon, I was back in his drawing room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried writing. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that day marked a change in my career."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year support the growth of tropical rainforests, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy regions can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases is on a spinning planet. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee, which was a big deal. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training on how to make coffee, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making a perfect, creamy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to cleaning duties again. Fortunately, my boss was understanding. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to develop your skills."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A clear example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series, *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong presence, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to a type of art that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available, or you can rent a boat if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here, and Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches extend for 200 miles, resembling a string of pearls. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bikes from bamboo, a material that is becoming popular in bike construction.

Bamboo bikes have a long history, with companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire bringing back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for regular cyclists. They wanted to do more than just sell frames; they aimed to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community than a traditional business. Both James and Ian have full-time jobs—James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 

As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle using 40 mm diameter bamboo, then move on to the thinner parts for the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process requires careful cutting and technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help, ensuring everything is done correctly.

The chance to build your own bike is a big draw for many participants, especially since most of them are engineers. Ian reassures us that mistakes are normal, and if something goes wrong, we can just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each bamboo length is checked for quality, allowing us to choose the look of our frame—plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, we focus on building the lugs, which involves wrapping hemp bindings around the joints and using epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without any issues.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional frames, they have a unique charm. James and Ian emphasize that individuality is important. Personally, I prefer a bike that offers a relaxed ride, so I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth experience. 

When I take James’s bike for a ride, I find it light and comfortable, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes that the real joy of these workshops comes when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is also appealing—less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-Help Books**  
Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first encountered a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she recalls, and she was correct. Dr. Gray has since become a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend has started her own company. Dr. Gray's short book on improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry that, according to its supporters, addresses many of Americans' desires for self-improvement. However, it also capitalizes on these desires, creating even more needs and supporting the entire New York publishing industry. In Britain, the genre has shown that it can produce many books that are as questionable and dramatic as their covers. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too niche. This is a small mercy. As a new type of powerful editor searches for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is marketability. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions, then admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**  
There must be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this agreement is often not fully honored. There are many reasons why a writer might hold back. They may have thoughts or actions they find too shameful to reveal. They might also decide that certain details are not significant enough to include. Additionally, there are more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. An autobiographer might believe that the ultimate goal of their work—revealing the truth about themselves—can be better achieved by creating stories that capture the essence of their experiences more effectively than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may choose to disregard the agreement from the start, labeling their book an autobiography simply to create a sense of trust in the reader, which can be useful for their storytelling. This can lead readers to believe they have read a true account when, in fact, they have only encountered fiction. This can happen without any intention of being deceitful.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective fiction have suggested that the rise of this genre reflects the social conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story serves as an allegory. The crime symbolizes deep human desires like lust or greed, and its resolution represents the restoration of order in society, calming its chaotic impulses so that it can function properly again. In Hammett's unique version, society is restored, but it is revealed to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal represent two sides of the same character. The private investigator and his target understand each other and share a strange comfort. The detective exists in both worlds: he is too honest for the criminals and too shady for the law. He embodies both a criminal and a competitor. His mission is sometimes influenced by his sense of guilt, and at other times, his desire for justice is heightened by his awareness of this conflict.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of today's best scientific essayists. To discuss his craft and hear his insights, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt particularly comfortable in such a pretentious setting. Regarding writing in such an environment, Gould remarked, ""I couldn't do it; Trollope might, but he understood the culture. Knowing the culture is essential for being a successful writer. Science, for instance, is its own civilization. Therefore, only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't belong to the community and don't grasp its rules, you're at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's key principles is to never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language but must never dilute the argument. Above all, if readers feel patronized, your piece will fail."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it can feel like being in the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could benefit from natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as decorative garden pieces. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts exhibition long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, making it seem like they had either practiced for years or had a special talent. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not paint with the same speed I had seen before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Due to a mistake at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or a computer error, Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another flight. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses told them to stay together. The brochure hadn’t mentioned an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they didn’t question the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, they were alarmed to find out they were supposed to stay there for their entire holiday. 

The receptionist cheerfully explained, ""We have the lake and the water birds, and you can take a steamer to Interlaken."" Keith calmly told him, ""There’s been a mistake. We were meant to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" The receptionist replied, ""I don’t know that name, sir. This is Switzerland."" 

Keith insisted, ""An official said a coach would take us on. She was here last night."" The receptionist said, ""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you’ve changed your minds..."" 

""We haven’t changed our minds. There’s been a mistake,"" Keith repeated. The receptionist shook his head, unaware of any mistake. Dawne then interrupted, describing the bald man with glasses who made the booking and naming the travel agency in London. 

A woman, who was the stout one Keith had seen at Gatwick, approached them. ""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" Dawne asked, ""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks? We’re in the wrong hotel."" 

Keith explained, ""We got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" Dawne added, ""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover; we heard them talking about Darlington."" Keith wished she would let him speak. 

""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" Keith said. ""We knew you were in charge."" Mrs. Franks replied, ""I counted you, although you probably didn’t see me. Let me explain: Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many different holidays at various prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 

She continued, ""All tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands. If you followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" She laughed, adding, ""But that couldn’t happen."" 

Keith insisted, ""We’re not meant to be in Switzerland."" Mrs. Franks unexpectedly walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems kind,"" Dawne whispered, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that had happened: handing over the tickets, waiting, and then boarding the plane. 

An elderly man interrupted his thoughts, introducing himself as Mr. Nottage. He and his wife, both in their eighties, said they had the best night’s sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 

""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed. Outside the hotel, they didn’t mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people, when they had wanted to escape the demands of older age. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about his voyage on the Endurance are being published quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and draw lessons about leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce must be laid off."" While it may seem challenging to connect Shackleton's survival skills in extreme conditions to managing a corporate crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton's leadership qualities are relevant. 

""Even if a company handles its crises well, poor communication can still cause harm,"" says MacGregor. ""Shackleton is a model for management because he was a strong leader and communicator. He had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives."" One of Shackleton's most remarkable decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice demonstrated his commitment to the safety of his men.

In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton reassured his men, saying, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" Throughout the ordeal, it was clear that Shackleton was always in control.

""Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible, ready to change plans when necessary. We have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.""

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in tough times is to wait, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix problems quickly,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it's better to hold on and wait for your money to come back rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, if a new product isn't successful, don't keep selling it.""

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted Hurley wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn't. Another crew member recalled Shackleton doing something similar during a previous expedition when they were starving: he said he would leave a biscuit in the snow rather than eat it, emphasizing its value.

As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, notes: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton highlights the lack of heroism in today's world. He stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye, which has a feeding style similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by breaking into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel into the wood and its long tongue to pull out the insects. In contrast, the aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unusual feeding method was first described over a century ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting abilities of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, as well as a female named Samantha and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several narrow holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes quickly went for the logs with food, gnawing through the wood without needing to rely on the visual signs of holes. This raised the question of how they located the mealworms. It was initially thought they might be using their sense of smell or hearing, but further tests showed they did not need these senses either. Even when the smell of the insects was blocked or when the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them.

Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes could sense the cavities in the wood. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long middle finger and positions its large ears forward to listen closely. Dr. Erickson believes that the aye-aye is using a form of echo-location, listening for sounds that indicate a hollow space beneath the surface. It may also hear the movement of insects when they are disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are other birds, like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be completely unfilled. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also shares behaviors with squirrels. Its front teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to extract the nut meat."

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how well do we really know their lives and who they were when they were young? The few diaries we find often leave us wanting more, and family stories can be unclear. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never seem to do it. We might leave behind videos instead of photos, but those are still just images.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardcover book of at least 20,000 words, sometimes with illustrations. Her focus is on ordinary lives, not famous ones. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of her past was fading away. ""At first, I didn’t take it seriously, but after meeting people with interesting lives, I changed my mind,"" she says. Many of her clients say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they also enjoy the process themselves.

The promise of confidentiality helps her clients feel free to share their true feelings. One 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure in business, said, ""I was surprised by what I revealed. Some memories were painful, like my divorce."" He wrote his story for his family, hoping they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let them read it yet. He feels some details might hurt them, and he prefers they read it only after he is gone. He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led him to repeat mistakes in his life.

Ms. Renier has seen this in many people. ""It’s surprising how much people are influenced by their parents,"" she explains. The messages they received as children can affect their behavior for the rest of their lives. Many people end up marrying those their parents would approve of, or they rebel against their parents’ choices.

Many clients express regrets about unresolved issues with their parents, even decades later. If someone had problems in their youth, they often carry those into middle age. They may live their lives trying to impress a parent who never acknowledged them, and some even seek permission to express their frustrations.

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Ms. Renier maintains a respectful distance. ""I’m not here to pry,"" she says. Sometimes, clients share something and then hesitate, saying, ""I’m not sure if that should be included."" She usually includes it anyway, allowing them to remove anything they don’t want in the draft. Most people want to be honest about their lives.

This is not vanity publishing; it’s not about people boasting about their interesting lives. In our fast-paced world, we often lose touch with the past. These autobiographies help people connect with their roots, especially since families no longer gather as they used to. Many seek a sense of immortality through their stories.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and adding her interpretation. Modern technology allows her to create everything except the binding, which features gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is well-organized and written, reflecting the quality of the person’s life story. Each book costs nearly £3,000, with additional copies priced at £25 each. Although she receives about ten inquiries a week, the high cost discourages many potential clients. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she admits. ""But the people I’ve worked with are often from affluent backgrounds, readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen, who might have once commissioned portraits for their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a large collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all accurate replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery that has great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are significant: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view nearly all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, known as facsimiles, to preserve the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates, which served as memorials alongside tomb statues, spread from Germany throughout medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples can be found in Britain, with the widest variety available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, but I feel fortunate to have spent 35 years with young children, and I truly cherish every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding my baby, which I believe is a key part of being a father. I feel very lucky with my children; we share many interests like opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly adults and I see them more as a friend than just a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. Although I have sometimes reacted in anger, I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I wait for them to reach out to me, as I believe that chasing them for contact creates unnecessary guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young, around 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they grew into teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, which makes me sad. However, now I enjoy taking them on trips to places like the south of France. They get along well with my friends and join us at parties and advertising events without feeling out of place. I think my job, which they find exciting, has helped our relationship.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was starting my political career, and soon after, I had more children. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political responsibilities grew, finding time became difficult. I now only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can join me. This way, they can see what I do when I’m not with them, and they don’t feel like I’m disappearing from their lives. I’ve noticed that more politicians are bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our kids in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think deeply about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. At one point, my ex-wife and I even lived next to each other so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was present, but like many parents from the Seventies, I may have treated them like adults too soon. Kate recently mentioned that we were too lenient. I believe I could have set more rules and structure. I regret that now, and I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that sense, your children never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I felt ready for children when I turned 30. I had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, but it also makes you just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one smile from her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful and can soften even the toughest person."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their theories. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other, but it was actually a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964. The 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were about to experience an incredible flight. Inside, the plane resembled a long white tunnel with few windows and lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous young scientists sat.

For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to propose creative experiments to be conducted in weightlessness. Those with the best ideas earned a spot on this unique flight, which felt like the most extraordinary roller-coaster ride.

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that mimicked a giant bird soaring upwards before diving back down. The goal was to create moments of weightlessness at the top of each curve. When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft would rise higher due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. During the brief moments of weightlessness, the students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the plane into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were thrown around the cabin. Then, the engines stopped, and we quickly transitioned to weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. Moving became confusing; directions like left, right, up, or down lost their meaning. Only gravity helps us understand where we are.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, causing some students to land hard. After completing the first curve, some students felt uneasy about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves provided ten minutes of ""space time"" for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to find out how cats always land on their feet. They released a device they built to investigate this, and one student managed to flip it over using a remote control. 

However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on the device, nearly damaging it. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints behave without gravity, which could help in building future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They hoped that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not nausea. This experience would stay with us for a long time. One student said, ""It was unforgettable. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine consecutive winters. I enjoyed this because I like winter. My parents had the idea of buying a small piece of land for my siblings and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The goal was for us to always have a connection to New Zealand, which is a lovely thought since my father grew up there. They found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees. I have always been passionate about land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and I was eager to start. My family became enthusiastic as we progressed. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember that time as very happy since I was often wet and cold. Each morning was a challenge: getting ready for the next planting session. I would come out of the Land Rover, still warm and dry, but then face the rain, with my jacket damp from the previous day, my boots soaked, and my hands struggling with slippery laces. “The brain starts to take over, allowing for all sorts of strange thoughts and reflections about life.” 

In that first year, I had an experienced tree-planter working with me, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it’s heavy, and only when it gets lighter does it become easier. The hardest part of the job was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line. These poles guide your planting. Once you are aligned, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back. I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig the hole. 

This rhythm is something everyone talks about, and it’s true for many farming jobs. You train your body to perform a series of standard moves, making the task much easier. You develop a regular process: taking the tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. Mentally, it’s fascinating. My mind would wander, allowing me to think about the natural world and our place in it. Many of my thoughts about these topics began during that time.

I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and have watched the trees grow, which is very satisfying since I planted them and feel a connection to their success. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such headlines make me anxious. Fortunately, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand in 1984, completely alone for three months. During that time, I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area remains very strong. In many ways, it is the place I feel most connected to, representing the bond between people and the earth—a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have run an open farm in Somerset for six years, known for caring for orphaned animals. However, the strange noise coming from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—caught my attention. I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they become orphaned, they often starve and are never found. 

These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still suckling. Although the cubs were healthy, they were cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. I named the two females Primrose and Bluebell, and the male Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to mimic their mother’s licking, which helped them relieve themselves. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, though a bit unsteadily. They were happy together, with a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize its importance. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that he had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it’s crucial not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, especially for such a small cub. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two.

Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about my cubs, came to see me. He had found another male cub abandoned by its mother behind some silage bags. He knew she wouldn’t return, as the area had been disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother had left him; he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day.

By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more variety. At nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year, as the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.

By August, my badgers had started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase each other’s tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with colorful bruises.

During two late-night walks in a dry spell, I noticed other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, even though badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive towards others. We were warned that they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a campaign to build a sett for them on the farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside.

As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and bedding than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the project, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a proper home.

One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Nowadays, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t fully wake up until midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she has joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before rushing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, during his time, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" using calculations from his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding declination was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley, one of only two men in England paid for scientific research at that time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew issues, but he later sailed to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these journeys, he published a chart in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. More advanced charts based on his work helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.

Dr. Clark, a passionate sailor, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, with support from Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during his two years at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not only an astronomer but also researched geophysics. While serving as Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and pursued other interests.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his work, *Principia Mathematica*, which is fundamental to classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with much more accurate instruments. These measurements are necessary because the Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data collected will help improve the current mathematical model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is common to measure the strength but not the direction of the magnetic field,"" Dr. Clark explains. ""You need to know true north to measure direction. On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites for this."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments, and a Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground-based measurements will be useful for comparison.

Halley's Atlantic journey was significant as it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he became the first civilian naval captain to pursue the study of declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to succeed in his voyage? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to dedicate eight months to this, so some might see me as obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the critical eyes of the peahens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could birds develop such extravagant features in a world where survival is often about being strong or fast? How do they manage to thrive with such a burden?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, a century after Darwin's death, to find answers. Darwin believed that living beings evolved through natural selection, meaning that the individuals best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Typically, this would mean that the strongest or smartest individuals would thrive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, leading Darwin to propose a different idea called ""sexual selection."" He suggested that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be a deeper reason behind this choice. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it indicated some other quality that contributed to survival.

Today, researchers still debate these ideas. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging, but the 200 birds at Whipsnade, which live in a semi-wild environment and are accustomed to humans, provide a unique opportunity for research. Petrie and her team are focusing on two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most extravagant tails? And do these males possess any additional qualities that make them better mates, as Wallace suggested, or is it just about appearance, as Darwin thought?

Observations show that the peahens do seem to prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be less likely to have parasites, and their bright feathers could signal their health. There is some evidence for this in other bird species, but Petrie and her team have not yet been able to study the internal health of the peacocks at Whipsnade.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive ones. Are the young of the attractive males healthier and growing faster? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is based on practical benefits.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician and biologist R.A. Fisher, known as ""Fisher's Runaway."" This theory suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that trait, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to males with increasingly long tails, reinforcing the idea that females are selecting for beauty.

In conclusion, this ongoing research may ultimately support both Darwin's and Wallace's theories, showing that beauty can play a significant role in mate selection."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix traditional and modern elements. He has applied this idea in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many beautiful yachts filled with the latest technology. Most of these boats are based on a new hull design that emerged 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. I might be, but I’m not sure.

My boat combines the charm of classic design with the benefits of modern technology. However, while technology is essential in today’s boat design and building, it often separates sailors from the true challenges of life at sea. Many sailors seek to reconnect with these challenges by going to sea. I’m not saying that sailors should face every hardship. I believe it’s important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor.

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change often results in a cabin that resembles a luxury cruise ship, with a bed larger than one at home. To me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house.

When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that it had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over the years, I learned how true that was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and most enjoyable boat I ever sailed.

However, classic boats require a lot of maintenance, and when I injured my back, I realized I could no longer care for Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but found none that met my needs, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design programs, Irens first sketched the boat on a paper napkin before moving to the computer. After creating a model, just like traditional boatyards did, we refined the design together. The final version was perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, sails beautifully, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. This may be because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture. This traditional approach works well. In her calm presence, she proves that you don’t need to follow trends to find happiness, and sometimes it’s wise to learn from history. Built with timber treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. This means she has the advantages of a fiberglass boat while still looking, feeling, and sailing like a classic."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to unwind. My room in the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I did nothing but sleep. Starting on the second day, I joined body conditioning classes and tried as many activities as I could, like yoga and stretching. The instructors were very skilled, and I was amazed at how flexible I became during the week. They offer a wide range of treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, truly makes you feel rejuvenated. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly, kind, and professional. The atmosphere was lively and positive. Henlow is planning to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer a quieter time and the weather is nice, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to return. This is the ideal getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I walked up the grand staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can avoid talking to others if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, including an examination of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt a bit strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder issue found during the check-up was quickly addressed by the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you’re not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are reasonably priced.  
*Liz Gregory*

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and doesn’t pretend to be. It’s a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you’re counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food, which includes rich sauces and creamy desserts made by a French chef. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, so I could work off some of the delicious food. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic. I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.  
*Beverly D'Silva*

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-rated restaurant, serves amazing dishes. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many options. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other journalists who would write about fitness assessments and beauty treatments. Cliveden has all these options if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It’s the best because it’s the most delicious I’ve ever had, but it’s also the worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a setback if you’re trying to lose weight. You’ve been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the treatment. I returned to my room and had the best night’s sleep in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to book appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse group, including football teams, mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed significant differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This suggests that the traits that make us human are a recent development in our evolutionary history. Our ability to create art and other unique human characteristics likely come from just a small number of our genes. This is a heavy responsibility for such a limited set of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree rather than kind. For instance, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools; chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a basic form of language, using different sounds to warn of predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. This means that aside from art, there are few clear differences between humans and animals.

However, if human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. We only have clear evidence of human art, such as cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments, starting around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we argue that our recent artistic achievements set us apart, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three common claims are made: human art is non-utilitarian, it is created for aesthetic pleasure, and it is learned rather than instinctive. 

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While some human art serves a purpose in communication, it is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong has clear functions, such as defending territory or attracting mates, which help transmit their genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily recognizable. However, these styles are not genetically inherited. In contrast, some bird species are born with the ability to sing their specific songs, even if they have never heard them before. 

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly our art styles change. For instance, geese have honked the same way for 2,000 years, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum visitors can tell that a twentieth-century painting is more recent than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify the time and artist of a painting they have not seen before. However, even experts might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment, and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These chimpanzee paintings challenge the distinctions between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the paintings by these apes did not serve a practical purpose; they were created for the satisfaction of the painter. One might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend to communicate through their work, while the apes did not care about sharing their paintings. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human artworks were also created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth and also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left, and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and squinting eyes, searching for the unknown. Nowadays, such characters are rare in both fiction and real life. That was my belief until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's adventure involved leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, which means ""once entered, you never come out."" Locals call it the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of this incredible journey from the comfort of his home. His team included four Britons (one was a medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone and threatened the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the harshest deserts in the world, and Blackmore has written a captivating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to find purpose in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t return since no one had ever completed that route; we were going into it without any knowledge.""

In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and Blackmore described the desert as ""kind."" However, anyone reading his remarkable story would question this description. The team faced extreme hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and the loss of part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn’t experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we avoided the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn’t mean we didn’t face challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What motivated me most was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely alone. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very afraid of my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to start now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was toned, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the struggle it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share. By that measure, the desert doesn’t compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We were motivated by a sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,"**Text: 'Rediscovering Manual Labor'**

Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy the benefits of doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing devices that simplify our lives and give us more free time. However, this reliance on technology has led us to believe that it is essential, which may not be true. For example, using our hands for tasks does not harm the environment, unlike some gadgets.

After a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost a lot to fix, Susan began to question whether gadgets are really worth the money and hassle. She started to let her household technology fade away as it broke down. This made her think about what ""time"" technology actually gives us. Does it just allow us to take on more activities that require even more gadgets? If that’s the case, it seems like a clever marketing trick.

When her broken device started making strange noises, even after being unplugged, she decided to leave it outside, where it now sits quietly. Susan enjoys not being tied to noisy machines and prefers to take her time with her sewing. She has always been a bit nervous around electric sewing machines, which can be dangerous.

While there are some gadgets she appreciates, like her washing machine, she has found joy in living without others. For instance, after feeling that they were spending too much time in front of the television, she returned their rented color TV and switched back to a small black-and-white one. This change has encouraged them to spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies.

One of her hobbies is sewing, and she has stopped using her old sewing machine, which now serves as a plant table. Although she cannot afford to replace it, she has started sewing by hand. Many people believe they cannot live without their gadgets, but Susan feels differently. She thinks about how past generations endured hard work without modern conveniences.

Computers have made our lives easier by performing complex tasks quickly and providing entertainment. However, Susan finds that hand sewing is not boring at all. In fact, it allows her to listen to the radio or talk with family while she works. If the task is simple, she can even watch her favorite TV shows without feeling guilty, as she is also being productive.

Sewing by hand gives her a comforting feeling, especially when she sits by the fire with a cup of tea. She used to think that women who sewed intricate items by hand had a difficult life, but now she appreciates the calming nature of crafting. She finds satisfaction in watching her work improve and enjoys the slower pace of life that comes with it.

Additionally, she has taken back control of her kitchen, enjoying the simple act of washing dishes while daydreaming. This reflection has led her to reconsider the need for various appliances in her home. She wonders if they really need a freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. In fact, she realizes they could save a lot of money by living without electric lights!"
CAE_62,"Text: 'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man in a hurry. When I arrive at his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It’s hard to tell if he is truly brusque or just hiding his shyness. However, looking around the workshop, it’s clear that Hurst is busy, with good reason to not waste any time. The space is filled with unfinished furniture and wooden planks in a variety of natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a strong reputation. His order book is always full for months ahead, even though he doesn’t actively promote himself. People know that if you want a quality cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the one to contact. 

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, as the craft is thriving in the countryside. However, it is harder to find a cabinet-maker who focuses on creating beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple designs. ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers,"" Hurst says with a hint of disappointment. As a craftsman with high standards, he often feels let down by modern furniture. ""I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people accept."" His pursuit of perfection is clearly a key part of his success, along with his talent. Hurst is confident about his skills. ""I have a huge natural ability,"" he states seriously. ""I have always been good at making things."" If it weren’t for his modesty towards the end of our conversation, I would have thought he was completely serious.

Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up,"" he says casually. Most of his work comes from private clients. ""I used to do commercial work for companies, but it was soul-destroying."" Some clients return to him repeatedly. ""You end up doing their whole house. That is very satisfying."" However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. ""The most frustrating clients are those who don’t know what they want, and then change their minds too late. My favorite clients are the exacting ones."" 

While Hurst has every reason to be proud, he is also generous in praising others when it’s deserved. With a sudden touch of modesty, he says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other craftsmen. After all, I wasn’t trained at Parnham,"" which is a top furniture design college. However, he is critical of those craftsmen who ""try to be artists and take a year to make one piece."" He also has little patience for degree shows, where students showcase their work while trying to make fashion statements. ""That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture should be practical and usable."" 

Hurst may be confident and direct, but he is not pretentious. His final words show a refreshing down-to-earth attitude towards his work and a humility that contrasts with his earlier confidence. ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" he says as I leave.'"
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping, which suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need so much sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory suggests that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It argues that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and restore our energy.

The second theory focuses on the benefits of sleep for learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day, and without it, we would struggle to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It suggests that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own quirks and peculiarities. For example, someone might enjoy entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing passionate letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality.

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism represents our desire to be unique, while conformity represents our need to fit in. For many, the desire to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests, which others might see as strange. The key idea here is 'common.' They seek others who understand their oddities, as being part of a group can be comforting.

Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be ourselves. Even when we follow the crowd, we may feel the need to assert our individuality. For instance, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" or a new acquaintance might declare, ""You must take me as you find me. I don't stand on ceremony.""

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, the American singer, once said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then pursue it passionately—don't back down and don't give up—you will confuse many people."" However, this self-assertion is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, they are not being eccentric. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they may be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are.

True eccentrics are not concerned with public opinion; they act according to their true selves. This sets them apart from enthusiasts, practical jokers, clever criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all aware of society. Eccentrics, on the other hand, live their lives freely, regardless of societal expectations."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the opportunity to meet many important figures in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been central to environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, I found that she helped me understand these complex topics better than anyone else. Choosing her book was more difficult. I considered ""Only One Earth"" and ""Progress for a Small Planet,"" but I believe ""The Home of Man"" is her most significant work. It discusses the rapid growth of cities while addressing the larger themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now refer to as ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book beautifully explains the fascinating world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos into a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a distinguished behaviorist who aimed to make his research accessible to everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion resulted in a book that appeals to anyone who loves nature. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, vividly show how one gull can be aggressive while another is submissive. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a fulfilling career in conservation, but it also deepened my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Many believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, viewing all living beings as a family, intertwined and inseparable. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I discovered ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images captivated me. I already owned other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which inspired me to start sketching them. However, ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a section on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and stunning images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new possibilities for my future."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?** We asked five major British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here’s what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers; they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more accepting of bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers will want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views on a book since they often read it first.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers have different needs when it comes to book reviews. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, ideally in a positive way. Book reviews today are more varied and accessible than they were 40 years ago, but there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which many people read. Weekly summaries of books are often not enough, and even original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. However, publishers should not complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews, which are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a trusted source can significantly boost sales, especially if there are multiple reviews.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, and we rarely advertise, so we rely on literary editors to give our books space. Positive reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the length of reviews than their content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be supported by other factors like word-of-mouth recommendations and effective marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., it’s straightforward: a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, booksellers often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for a good writer to gain readers. Interestingly, some poorly received books or those without reviews can still sell very well. The situation is unpredictable, although non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than on the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they actually lead to sales? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn’t sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer’s name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, people paid attention. Today, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages buyers to visit the bookstore."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith, one of the few artisans in the country who creates hand-cut weathervanes. Graham designs each piece to meet the specific needs of his customers. ""This way, I can create a unique, personalized item,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for special gifts for their husbands, wanting something that reflects their partner's business or hobbies.

Graham's work is quite different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. In fact, the first weathervane he made featured a witch on a broomstick, which surprised his wife. Friends admired it and soon asked him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that the subjects I could use were endless,"" he explains. This realization led him to focus on his weathervane business.

Before starting this venture, Graham trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Five years ago, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles: she became the main breadwinner while he took care of their children and built the business. He has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job lacked creativity, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he shares. ""I really enjoy the design process.""

Graham has now developed over 100 original designs. He pays great attention to detail and always seeks customer approval for the silhouette design before he begins cutting. He also keeps a selection of traditional designs available, as they remain popular alongside his unique creations. ""People are drawn to handmade items,"" he notes. ""They appreciate the chance to own something a bit different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to maintain its rural craft nature. ""I have found my niche in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I find great satisfaction in transforming a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he explains. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by indicating changes in wind direction."" Nowadays, as more people move to rural areas, they want to add a special touch to their homes, which has benefited crafts like his.

Graham's business has grown, and he now supplies flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, with particular interest from buyers in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans faced many challenges. His film project, *Life and Limb*, which he had worked on for months, suddenly fell apart. He felt disappointed and worried because it had been two years since he earned any money, and he was struggling to keep his bank manager calm. A sensible person in his situation would have found a job, perhaps returning to television. Instead, Evans made a surprising choice: he bought a ticket to America to spend three months researching his first novel.

Although this decision seemed impulsive, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. He had met a farrier in Dartmoor who told him about a gentle horse that unexpectedly became aggressive. The horse's owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These special people were called ""horse whisperers,"" and Evans was intrigued. Initially, he planned to write a screenplay, but after losing hope in the film industry, he decided to write a book instead.

During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing others, but I felt very alone and worried about my life falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, unsure how to support my family, and questioning if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from his bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for an estimate, he suggested Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more months of work ahead. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with the summary, to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an initial offer of $75,000. ""You what?"" Evans replied, surprised. The agent explained, ""It's OK, I just feel something big is happening.""

What happened next is now part of publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were in shock. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans said. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for the film rights. ""My UK agent wisely involved an American agent, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" 

As they agreed on this amount, the studios each wanted to present their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four prominent filmmakers called one after another, eager to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. 

Evans shared this story with me over coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been like a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don't want to become just another employee for these people I like who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then hear, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll bring in someone else now.'""

He plans to stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new funding for *Life and Limb*, but he was uncertain if he wanted to pursue that project. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become increasingly a game for younger players. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game impressively, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

The game of chess has changed significantly in the last two decades. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Today, winning is the main goal for chess players. In international chess, a player’s mental strength and endurance are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high, with a chess clock ensuring players make their moves in a set time. If they fail to do so, they lose immediately. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also evolved. Much preparation now happens off the board, including psychological strategies. Players must prepare thoroughly before matches, especially with the rise of computer databases that can store millions of chess games. These tools allow players to analyze their opponents' past games and find weaknesses. 

Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes worldwide. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort, as a single game can last up to eight hours. During this time, players must maintain focus, as even a small mistake can lead to losing. The presence of the chess clock adds to the stress, often leading to frantic moments where players must make quick moves or risk losing. 

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and relief from stress. However, one victory is not enough to win a tournament; players must be ready for the next challenge. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in 1984 had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing significant weight.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game puzzling. However, it also adds to his legacy. If he has returned for financial reasons, he will likely succeed, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some of the new British talent, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.

**A**  
Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" What is remarkable about Nick is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car, which I probably wouldn't do now because I understand the challenges involved. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my work to be performed, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""For the first time, I was around people who thought like me. It was a very enjoyable and stimulating environment.""

**B**  
Simon Pegg, 28, has made significant progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just completed a demanding tour with comedian Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard, even during his time at university, where he practiced his comedy skills in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C**  
Ciaran McMenamin, 24, gained public attention as the lead in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he smiles. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position for someone who has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that such success was likely. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from leading roles in school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting as an excuse to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

**D**  
Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a hit, but for me, if just two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel discouraged. Just when I was about to give up, I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I had been in some terrible bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E**  
Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is well-known in the poetry community, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I realized I needed to after getting bored stuffing envelopes at a theater."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a bold step. ""My poetry has a structure, which limits the chance of making mistakes. A novel can be any length, so there are more opportunities for errors. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I just produce work without caring about its quality."""
CAE_1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, believes she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she wants to avoid the wrong crowd. At 31, she is an art student who loves historical romances and is searching for Mr. Right, worried that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. Despite her concerns, she remains hopeful, which ultimately helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a style reminiscent of early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It offers a humorous perspective on radio, seen through the eyes of a clever but timid child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station quickly features a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to showcase his dry humor and subtle writing style, taking readers back to the simpler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores, vintage cars, and, of course, radio.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poetess, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poetess writes poor poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also seeking his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author unravels these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a highly enjoyable and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become intertwined in each other's lives for the next twenty-five years. At the beginning of this lengthy novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that they both loved a woman who was killed years earlier. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to deeply connect with the characters and become fully engaged in their lives.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make amends, he becomes a father figure to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor, dealing with the challenges of family life. The story explores a range of emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a significant direct contribution to development. While they may help build homes or schools, they often pay a large fee to participate in this work. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the volunteer could provide. This is particularly true for gap year volunteers, who usually have little technical skill or professional experience. Therefore, many studies raise the question of whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a genuine desire to help the local community or if young people are more interested in gaining experience that will benefit their careers. However, these projects can help develop individuals who may act ethically in support of those who are less fortunate in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, increased participation in global issues through civic organizations, and the growth of international social networks among everyday people. In this way, the overall benefits can be greater than the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and host communities, and contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those communities that lack access to international volunteer opportunities. Volunteers may continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities to advance their own goals.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity, where wealthy Westerners seek personal development. At its best, it can provide benefits to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing issues of inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of individuals wanting to help others. These limited efforts, aimed at making a small difference, can seem positive, especially in a climate that is skeptical of large governments and businesses. However, this approach can overlook the need for democratic governance and reduce development to individual acts of charity, which often do not address the root causes of poverty in rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is often misplaced, the act of volunteer tourism can sometimes be seen as simple charity. However, when it is promoted as sustainable development and when gap-year companies market their services as part of development efforts, it can dilute the true meaning of development. The politics surrounding volunteer tourism can reflect a retreat from understanding global inequalities and the poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help us get out of bed. This is why clock radios are popular. But how do you choose a good one? A panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

One model has a 'dual alarm function' that I initially thought would let you wake up to a buzzer, snooze for a bit, and then get up. However, the instruction booklet suggests using this feature to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and another for weekends. But who really schedules their life like that? This model is priced similarly to another one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a nice bonus. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to a peaceful morning. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size is an issue—it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best in terms of design and overall performance. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I was impressed by the digital display, which has stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze button allows you to tap it without opening your eyes. Unfortunately, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which led to confusion when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don’t have to reset it if someone accidentally unplugs it. Everyone liked this feature, but we found it complicated to set up. However, once we figured it out, we felt quite sophisticated.

Tom Granger criticized another model with a built-in lamp, calling it 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was difficult to position and not useful for reading, as it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed that tuning the radio was challenging. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, it has bright colors and a fun design, which appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out more than the others. In fact, its traditional controls were the only ones we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual states that 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time.' Paul Bridges laughed at this, saying the model was 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model we tested impressed Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space,' plus it has old-fashioned dial tuning. He said it was easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you can never be sure if you pressed the buttons correctly, which makes you doubt if it will work. He acknowledged that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I found the tuning a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. They are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward for protection. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, making them more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using their ball-rolling ability only as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in burrows. While all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do; some will remain awake throughout the year if conditions are suitable."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their dreams.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""Flying through the air and landing smoothly is an incredible feeling, but it can also be frightening. Sometimes, I don’t feel well, or the weather is bad, making it hard to see, but I push through. It’s tough to have a life outside of skiing since we train for ten months each year. I’ve given up a lot of my social life and friendships, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete on the same courses and receive equal treatment—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day, including stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment required.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because very few schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to a lack of stability in the women's team. Despite these challenges, I enjoy rowing and staying fit, and I appreciate the social aspect of the sport.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how vast it was! I found Britain too confining and safe. I was very determined and disliked being controlled by others. Each walk has been unique. My walk across Australia was the most painful experience, covering 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. However, I set a record because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, making them hesitant to sponsor us.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, especially on highways. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman in racing has its challenges. When I approach a corner, men feel they must beat me, which has led to many tough moments. You need to be competitive and aggressive. Earning money in this sport is difficult, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s encouraging to see more women entering the sport each year. For me, the thrill of saloon car racing comes from striving for perfection.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There’s a lot of pressure before races, and I really push myself during competitions. I often wonder why I do this, and I realize it’s because a) I feel happier when I’m fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also lower for women. However, we have established an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could easily recognize the famous artist while he was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old, unreliable van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of my time drawing and was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work in the hills. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have approached him to ask for his signature. I was nervous as I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, but to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below it. Even when Picasso's art was abstract, it often connected to real things, so his lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was even worse, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak freely. Still, I managed to tell Picasso about my strong interest in art and my admiration for his work. After a while, I returned to my boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. However, he noticed that the lunch was still going on and asked, ""Is that all? Why don’t you go back and take advantage of this opportunity? You might even draw his portrait.""

With my sketchbook in hand, I went back to Picasso's table. I thought it was best not to ask if I could draw him, as he might say no and ruin the moment. So, I just stood by the table, set my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled mischievously and made it hard for me to work. He acted out funny and strange expressions, rolling his eyes and sticking out his tongue, like a playful clown. I felt like giving up, but his playful spirit challenged me to keep going. Despite his antics, I sensed he was testing my determination.

Eventually, Picasso settled down and allowed me to study him without distractions. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed more like a fit 60-year-old than someone about to turn 84. His dark eyes were youthful and intense, and I tried to capture that in my drawing. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed distant and absorbed in his own thoughts. 

When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my portrait, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. However, he insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he created a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single, lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Still, I look back on that day with gratitude. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This article explains the strategies that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Freshness Factor**  
Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. To create this impression, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that fills the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors used in the store, like green, are chosen to suggest freshness. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, does not match this fresh image.

**B. Smart Product Placement**  
The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use technology to find out which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit items in these spots, while less profitable but fast-selling items are also featured. Products at eye level are particularly sought after by manufacturers. Special bins with discounts attract bargain hunters, and items that go well together, like desserts next to ice cream, are often placed near each other.

**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This means shoppers must walk past more tempting, higher-priced items. Chain stores may also position their popular products away from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and encounter other tempting products along the way.

**D. Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from a crowded display style to a more boutique-like approach, showcasing limited fashion items. This gives the impression of exclusivity, even though their clothing is mass-produced. Their success comes from both good store design and appealing clothing.

**E. The Total Cost**  
Food shoppers often focus more on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items to attract customers. They may even sell some staples at a loss to draw shoppers in, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They achieve low prices by buying in bulk or negotiating discounts with manufacturers.

**F. The Price Tag**  
Shoppers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and pay more attention to individual prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can influence buying decisions. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Effective Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, helping customers see the true colors of clothing. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to highlight fresh produce.

**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers through the store. This design encourages customers to follow specific paths, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road."" However, some shoppers may hesitate to explore areas off these paths. For example, Marks and Spencer use wood or marble flooring for main routes, leading shoppers to more inviting carpeted sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotions**  
As you enter a supermarket, you might see large, colorful images of delicious food, which can be tempting if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that display advertisements as you shop. These trolleys use sensors to show relevant ads, like ready-made meals when you pass certain sections. They are designed to attract impulse buyers and reportedly increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, aged 58, is famous for reaching the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written several books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sailing trip, where I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first experience on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 

When we reached a steep drop, I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how to do it. After I finished, he politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit worried, but he managed to lower himself safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion to combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural progression from our Skye adventure.

I admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin always consulted the crew first. Although most people hesitated to give him advice, it felt good to be part of the decision-making. Honestly, I found sailing quite challenging and boring. The moments of crisis were easier to handle because they got my adrenaline pumping. However, spending day after day in the middle of the sea was tough for me. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin was a natural sailor who enjoyed fixing the engine and the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless.

The crew was cramped, with six people on a 32-foot yacht designed for four. On a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other, but on the boat, we were always close together. When we arrived in Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times while climbing when if Robin fell, he could have taken me down with him. I had to be very careful. I also underestimated how difficult Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 

The first time we tried to reach the top, we were active for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we nearly fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges, but he completely trusted me and just followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted my decision. I knew he was worried about the boat and whether it would make it through the ice, but he still wanted to try climbing the mountain again.

The only time we had a serious issue was on the yacht on our way home. We were taking turns keeping watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt he didn’t trust me, which made me insecure, and I expressed my feelings. Robin quickly reassured me that I was misunderstanding the situation. While we enjoyed our trip to Skye, we truly got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for thousands of years, existing in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In neolithic Britain, they discarded apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. Ancient people in Switzerland and the Caucasus mountains even stored dried apple halves for winter. These early apples were wild crab apples, small and different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. One dessert apple, called Decio, was likely introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in Britain, and Norman varieties quickly became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of most Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
During the thirteenth century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, giving rise to the term 'costermonger,' meaning a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This trend continued until the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them valuable possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the well-known apple planter was John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed.' Born in 1774, he planted nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious beliefs led to many folktales about him.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa discovered a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named the apple 'Hawkey.' After sending it to a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples globally.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. She was known as 'Granny Smith' because she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing among discarded fruit, transplanted it, and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she remarked, ""Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from northern India to Africa. However, most apples come from just a few commercial varieties, often chosen for their appearance or ability to travel rather than their taste. This trend of uniformity is dulling our taste and reducing genetic diversity. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are beginning to demand more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity; we must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner and one of Britain's best 10,000-metre athletes, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a sunny mountain path leads from a quiet road in Nairobi to the start of the climb up Mount Kenya, the country’s highest peak. This beautiful but isolated place is called Nanyuk, and for the past three years, it has been my base for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners until my fourth winter training trip to Kenya. This time, I decided to break my routine. I participated in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I received an invitation from the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss.

Training at high altitude increases the number of red blood cells, which helps carry more oxygen. This advantage has contributed to the success of many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa, which took place before my time at the training camp, was also significant as it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. It was a humbling experience; out of 41 runners who finished ahead of me, only three were not Kenyan. I felt I had run well, but I realized that Kenyan success is not only due to altitude. Kenyan runners are known for their straightforward approach to the sport. Their running style appears effortless, their diet is simple, and they seem to enjoy competing.

One of the less discussed factors in Kenyan success is their training methods. My time at the training camp revealed the answers. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and lush vegetation. The facilities are basic, with athletes living among regular students in shared dormitories. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six in the morning, when we gather for a briefing from the coaches. ""Run easy; you have a tough day ahead,"" the coach reminded us as we set off. Each day, we covered about 40 kilometers, just short of a marathon. Sundays were easier, with only one scheduled run of 20 kilometers.

Life at the camp was simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth were enough for morning preparations. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small, dimly lit dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After our runs, we would drive to one of the streams fed by Mount Kenya's melting glaciers for a proper bath. By the end of my stay, I had a deeper appreciation for Kenyan success. It cannot be explained solely by genetics, upbringing, or altitude. I began to think that the simplicity of life in the mountains, the intense training, and the passion for success might be the true reasons behind Kenya's dominance in long-distance running."
CAE_7,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

As many people know, advertising is struggling. This decline started in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are deeper and are happening globally. The sad reality is that advertising has not adapted to the fast changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as more brands and media options have emerged, audiences have become more divided. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you might purchase only a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen, and for cars, you typically buy one every three years. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even when you include snacks, medicines, and other services, it is likely that you do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In contrast, there are about 32,500 branded products and services advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are analyzed by Media Register. The average consumer buys only 400 of these brands, which is about 4 percent. This challenges the common belief that half of advertising is wasted; in reality, it could be that 96 percent of advertising does not lead to purchases, but we cannot identify which part is wasted.

When you watch TV, try to count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. Most people find that only about one in 16 ads (6 percent) are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent of the ads may be wasted. Many people believe they are not influenced by advertising, but this is not true. Most people do not buy the majority of the brands they see advertised. 

Waste is a natural part of advertising through media. The idea that every reader or viewer will rush to buy all advertised brands is unrealistic. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many ads have shown that it can work. Advertisers need to reach a large audience to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as they cannot predict who will be interested.

Even the best-targeted advertising cannot guarantee a 100 percent response rate. This is a key difference between media advertising and personal selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every potential customer they meet. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all; they could contact those individuals directly.

For any advertiser, gaining one million new customers (about 2 percent of the adult population) is a significant achievement. The top-selling brands in supermarkets would be thrilled with an extra million customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can attract more than 2 percent of the population would be considered very successful, even though this is still a small portion of the total audience. While mass media can be a cost-effective way to reach people, advertising must become more focused to be effective again."
CAE_43,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Explores Britain's Most Eco-Friendly Home**

Charles Clover visits Southwell in Nottinghamshire, home to Britain's least-known ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster. This cathedral is admired by environmentally conscious writers for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen in the thirteenth century. Nearby is the 'autonomous house,' designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is known as Britain's greenest home.

The Vales have created a home that uses rainwater for drinking and washing, recycles sewage into compost, and heats the house using waste heat from appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house, which looks traditional with its clay tile roof, is located 300 yards from the Minster and blends in with the town's nineteenth-century architecture. It was approved by planners even though it is in a conservation area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you hear complete silence. The house is extremely well-insulated, with triple-glazed windows filled with krypton gas, making it very quiet inside. Once inside, after removing your shoes as requested by Robert, you experience a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow, as the house is designed to be draught-proof, even having a small air-locked door for the cats.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to environmental issues since the 1970s when they wrote a book called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to eliminate the need for mains water. They installed composting toilets, rainwater tanks in the cellar, and copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. They also let washing water flow into the garden, as they do not use a dishwasher, believing it is wrong to use harsh detergents.

Robert explains, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much less harmful to the environment without living in darkness."" The only medieval feature of the house is its design, with a hall that includes the fireplace and staircase, extending to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p—much less than what other four-bedroom homes use for heating.

Soon, they will install £20,000 worth of solar panels and equipment in the garden, which will allow the house to generate more electricity than it uses. They will still draw electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances but will have enough surplus to eventually charge an electric car. The only source of heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they rarely use except during the coldest days.

When asked if the house is warm in winter, Robert shared that during a visit in February, it was too warm to light the fire, with the first-floor temperature at 18°C. He believes this is comfortable because there are no draughts and everything feels the same temperature. He notes that people in the past were comfortable at lower temperatures due to their clothing. He suggests that those living in older homes should adapt to the past ways of living, though this idea may not be popular.

The house's success lies in its low-tech design, which minimizes potential problems. Most materials were sourced from local builders and installed by local craftsmen, making it affordable to build—costing the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are resistant to this approach."
CAE_51,"**The Camera Never Lies**

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a rational person and even a scientist. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article where he accepted fairies as supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out images of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges a key idea about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In reality, it can, and it always has. Nowadays, we often use computer software to edit our digital images, and it is a misconception that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths, who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were respected like doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture were crafted by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased. Heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used the beautiful wrought iron that blacksmiths created. In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. Still, much of the work produced seems repetitive, with manufacturers labeling their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks that look similar to each other.

Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be entering a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are becoming more aware of the craft. 

Modern power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld with less effort. Dawson explains that these artists now have the tools to express their creativity. The exhibition features about 250 pieces, including bookends and a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90 and going up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual artists, but a portion will be kept by the Association to promote quality ironwork.

Dawson has contributed an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a hand-blown glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow into shape when it’s hot, comparing it to drawing with metal in space. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals that are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, finds it magical because it is soft when hot but becomes hard and unyielding when it cools.

Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, while another resembles a Celtic cross. She appreciates the cold, hard nature of steel and how it feels permanent. No other metal has provided as much visual enjoyment or a sense of security. It seems likely that iron will continue to be used for decorative purposes for many years to come, as long as we can avoid more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**

I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying, even for me. 

The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I hadn’t planned to quit, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. Plus, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than friends who lived healthier lifestyles.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" to write an article about others trying to quit. I clearly stated, ""I won’t be trying to stop myself; I’m here to write, not to quit."" I thought I was being reasonable because I genuinely enjoyed smoking. It brought me real pleasure.

The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about quitting started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker started to give me a sense of power. It was a personal feeling that didn’t involve anyone else. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, disappeared after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it turned out to be fine. I had worried that I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was just relaxing at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I’ve come to realize that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to adjust to—like eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre intermission. These are all moments when I would have previously smoked."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been testing my friends on their knowledge of her. When I tell them I am writing her biography, I watch their reactions. If they seem surprised and ask if there is already a biography, they pass the test. 

Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman to win a Nobel Prize should be enough. Anyone else with such an achievement in literature would be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person, as complex as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects significant changes in the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend and worked in the same field. I went to a local bookshop, but I found no biographies of Pauling. I was surprised that he was not considered interesting enough for British readers, even though he was a highly influential chemist and a Nobel Prize winner in both chemistry and peace.

Even scientists sometimes think that biographies about scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, a Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers do too. This idea that scientists are less interesting than artists or writers is a common misconception. 

Some scientists are very careful about their public image. A well-known geneticist told me he would be happy to discuss his work but did not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This reluctance to share personal stories can create a false image of science and may discourage young people from pursuing scientific careers.

Fortunately, this is changing. Nowadays, scientists often appear in public in ways that go beyond traditional interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. While some may find this surprising, these activities help make scientists more relatable to the public.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be dry and overly respectful, often ignoring the personal lives of scientists. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been portrayed with their flaws on display. Readers find it interesting to see how these brilliant minds dealt with personal challenges, even if those challenges seem unrelated to their scientific work.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her research. She made significant discoveries, including the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She achieved these successes by pushing scientific techniques to new levels. However, she also balanced her career with her family life, raising three children and being married to a husband who was often away for work.

Her personal life may not be directly related to her scientific achievements, but it shows how she managed to integrate different aspects of her life. There is much in her story that is universally interesting, but it is also important to recognize her scientific contributions. 

Communicating the passion for science is a challenge for biographers. Many readers may not have the background to understand complex scientific ideas without extensive explanation. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that educated people who would feel embarrassed not to recognize a famous literary figure often remain unaware of the significant contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for her unique ability to find water. She uses a forked hazel stick to detect underground water sources. Farmers whose wells have dried up often seek her help. Along with her husband, she runs a well-drilling business that uses modern equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, when it comes to finding water, she relies solely on her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This skill, known as dowsing, involves locating water, minerals, and lost items underground. There are various theories about how dowsing works, ranging from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One popular theory suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, with water vibrating more than other materials. Some dowsers claim they can sense or even smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years, due to droughts, Margaret has been very busy, sometimes having a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells, as wells can last a long time, meaning she usually sees each customer only once. Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns, where installing water pipes is too expensive, and developers of golf courses who need water for their facilities.

Margaret typically looks for water at depths of 50 to 70 meters. She emphasizes the importance of drilling in safe locations to avoid contamination from waste. The water she finds is usually in cracks in solid rock, and as long as it is brought up directly, it should be clean. However, she notes that Cornwall has many minerals, so they must be cautious about iron in the water. 

Electricity is also necessary to operate the pump, but running power lines over long distances can be costly, so it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. Once these factors are considered, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still over the map, and it swings when she is above a water source.

After identifying potential areas on the map, she walks the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation and sways slightly. Once this feeling passes, she uses the stick to find the exact drilling spot. By holding the two forks of the stick and applying slight tension, she can tell if water is directly below. If the stick rises, it indicates water is present. 

It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates; even a small mistake can mean missing the water entirely. Margaret and her husband often dowse the same area, and they usually agree on where to drill. If they disagree, they will continue searching until they reach a consensus.

Margaret's skills are not just a local tradition; they have intrigued anthropologists and writers for a long time. She describes her ability as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. Without this unique skill, it would be difficult for her family to sustain their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be exciting to try something completely different. We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, 23, is a young mother with two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, 30, who works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant. 

Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and full of people, which was very different from her hometown. She felt nervous and overwhelmed. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when she tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and reassured her that everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, when the restaurant opened, there was already a long line of customers, and Amanda felt anxious about remembering their orders. Luckily, the ordering system was automated, which made things easier. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she struggled to hear customers over the loud music. She often had to ask them to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and just wanted to relax her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, which surprised Amanda. She realized that waitressing is much more demanding than she thought. She used to think it was an easy job, but it actually requires a friendly personality and the ability to handle a busy environment. Amanda, who is quite shy, felt she could never manage a Saturday night shift when it gets really hectic. She was also disappointed with the tips she received, especially from wealthy customers. After the experience, she was relieved to return to her children, as being a mother felt much easier in comparison!

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy, who is 30, was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She had heard that Amanda's daughters could be mischievous, but she thought she could handle it. 

After Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have three hours of peace. However, she soon found a note from Amanda reminding her of all the chores she still had to do, like making the beds and doing laundry. 

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, quickly shopped for groceries, and took her home for lunch. But when she brought Sophie home from school, things got chaotic. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and played a loud game. Cindy tried to stay calm, thinking they would tire out soon, but she was wrong. She thought she had good energy, but the girls outlasted her! After much effort, she finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the real challenge began. The girls kept asking for glasses of water, which was just a trick to get them downstairs to watch TV. Cindy realized how tiring it is to take care of two small children. There was no time for herself, and the responsibility felt overwhelming. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, 30, a primary school teacher. 

On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt luxurious! She was unsure how to dress for school, wanting to look appropriate instead of in her usual farm clothes. At assembly, she faced about 400 students and hoped she wouldn’t stand out too much. 

In class, the children worked in small groups on math, which was different from her own school experience. She also helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There was so much to do before classes resumed. She attended a staff meeting and ended up helping with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which she enjoyed, followed by a French lesson where the children practiced speaking with her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, she was exhausted, while the children seemed full of energy. Speaking in front of the class was the hardest part for her. Although teachers have more holidays, Rosemary decided she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had already been working for three hours! Rosemary's farm is large, with many animals and produces milk, ice cream, and yogurt.

Hilary spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling containers with milk and making ice cream. She had to resist the temptation to taste everything! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. If sheep are not checked regularly, they can die, which is especially difficult in winter. After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! 

Hilary found the day lonely and missed being around children, as animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of farming is the constant work; cows need to be milked twice daily, making it hard to take time off. Rosemary only gets about three days of vacation each year. While farming may seem romantic, the reality is quite different. The income can be unstable, and she wouldn’t want to rely on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many successful musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces. When you meet him, he looks youthful and has a bright personality, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a television feature was made about his work, filmed in both London and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo and began his career because of a Christmas gift he received when he was eight. His father, who did not play music but enjoyed Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother arranged for him to take lessons from the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, someone who was passionate about the trumpet and always looking for ways to improve.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to create a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and build a relationship with them. From the start, he had a unique sound that was recognizable, which he considers the first thing he developed.

Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and bought all his records. His parents supported his ambition to become a professional trumpet player and allowed him to practice as much as he wanted. At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson wanted him to go to America, it was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud discouraged him from joining an orchestra, saying that ""Playing in the orchestra is like digging in the garden.""

Hardenberger was aware that he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only the first round pieces but advanced to the second round. Fortunately, he was familiar with most of the pieces in that round as well. However, in the final, he faced a concerto that intimidated him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even though he felt he played poorly, people were still listening.

Hardenberger's honest view of his work might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what makes his communication with the audience special, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. He feels that the true power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**New In Paperback**

A. The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insights. It is a challenging but rewarding read.

B. Harriet is a composed, middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe physically recovers but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him consumes her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

C. This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, vividly imagined through the daydreams of the young character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He suddenly disappears from the story but returns after World War II, having learned to value the simple lives of his ancestors.

D. After his recent success, the author has written a sequel that carries the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's outlook on life remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie supports her in her entertaining manipulation of friends and suitors. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the underlying sadness in everyday life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright moments.

E. Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time adrift on ""the desert cities of waves."" The author employs striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which can be both isolating and enlightening."

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who share their experiences in different professions, discussing the positives, negatives, and their typical workdays.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7:00 am, and arrive at work by 8:00 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries last about three hours, but some can take all day. Occasionally, I work for ten hours straight without eating or taking breaks. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about the next day’s tasks. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it is incredibly rewarding, making up for the times it doesn’t. From 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain the surgeries to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time constraints can make this challenging. I usually leave work between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm. I am on call some nights and weekends, and I always carry my pager. During holidays, I often worry about my patients and dream about operating at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. I work in a team of three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My work is mostly about production, with only 10-15% being actual design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, especially with tight deadlines. Lunch is at 1:00 pm for an hour, and we often go to a pub. If the client is happy with my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be much later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7:00 am, but on some days, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5:00 am for long-haul flights. Around 10:30 or 11:00 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I pay attention to my diet and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. I often get asked for recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing me to plan my routes. While most passengers are polite, some can be rude. I have built good relationships with my regular clients. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11:00 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7:00 am, leave home by 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11:00 am, we take a break for a big breakfast at a local café. In summer, I may work until 10:00 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden design, I usually meet them in the evening. We focus on using old materials to create gardens that look historic. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren’t great, but it’s very satisfying to see a completed project bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. However, I sleep well because my job is physically demanding.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. As the assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that contractors follow the schedule and safety guidelines while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate site professionals and solve problems. The contractors start at 6:00 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. My day involves reviewing paperwork and answering design questions. I usually take a half-hour lunch between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we monitor the contractors' work, it can lead to conflicts, so we need to maintain open communication. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but I act immediately if something urgent arises. I typically leave the site around 6:00 pm and am always on call."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am to reach the office by 7:30 am. My job involves managing customer development programs for our credit card users. I launch and oversee the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I maintain contact with current card users, attract new ones, and build partnerships with companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle advertising for the membership program across Europe, meeting with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to address any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by reviewing the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. I listen to demo tapes carefully, knowing that they represent people's hard work, and I try to provide constructive feedback. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, selecting songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also share my vision for the album with the marketing team. I manage budgets and expenses. I leave work by 7:00 pm at the earliest, and most evenings I attend concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new bands in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule to see if we have any client meetings that day. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and helping them find furniture. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, sourcing them from auctions, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with our restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the industry, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle the accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I leave work at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax after work.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am and start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over from the night shift. I rotate between four control positions in the tower, working for about an hour and a half at each station before taking a break. My team, which includes other controllers and a supervisor, manages aircraft movements. In winter, we handle around 1,000 movements daily, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic regulations. This job is quite stressful, and I take sick leave if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. My first task is to start the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff breaks. I spend the morning assisting customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy helping customers, although it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss upcoming titles with them. I need to estimate how many copies we might sell of each title. When we want to feature a new book, I ensure it arrives on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work a late shift, closing the computer system and locking up before going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. My job is to assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, warning clients about potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly to gather information. I type the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, but it can be hard to relax, and I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others, drives change, and guides people towards a common goal. Leadership is not about physical traits like height, nor is it just about being smart. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is crucial, and a good leader should express it clearly and confidently. Dixon emphasizes the importance of saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Recognizing Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

**C. Comparing Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? A good leader motivates and supports you, while a bad leader makes you feel unimportant and blames you when things go wrong. The first one leads effectively; the second one just manages poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers prefer to work within set limits, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, states that a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can enhance your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to consider:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and act on them when you feel inspired.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is valuable, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, take the lead instead, and see how it changes the outcome.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

**F. Developing Leadership Skills**  
- Leadership doesn’t just happen; it develops through taking charge, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will be immediately accepted. It might even push people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your input is crucial and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Film Critic Nick James Reviews Recent Releases**

**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created this tense Cold War thriller about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The interactions and modest bravery of foreman Bud and his team remind us of similar heroes in Howard Hawks' films. The production design and special effects are outstanding, but the dialogue and character development feel weak. Despite the skill in filmmaking, the story is more like a B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the Guadalcanal battle, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different perspective compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often staying true to the book. He focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife, which is portrayed more harshly than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
This film, loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a cunning politician who secretly causes chaos. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is brief. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for a light-hearted film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama clichés with such charm and energy that it doesn’t feel like a problem.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film tells a somber story. The detailed production and costume design make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless in evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the plot, but the filmmakers focus too much on historical details, neglecting the dark and powerful story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill, especially in sound editing, where every sound is clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever there’s a quiet moment, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
Promoted as featuring ""forty-eight international stars,"" this three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck has four directors and 23,000 extras, making it feel overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news about the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. Logistically impressive, it loses impact on video, making it a less engaging experience."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed very engaging. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He unexpectedly has to defend his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the very end, and there is a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a strong debut in a competitive genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a bang and follows the charming Sigismondo, a troubleshooter for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church intrigue, and serious murder, but we are confident he will uncover the guilty parties. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit longer than necessary, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a fresh new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who finds herself in a unique position to investigate when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing criticism from various people, including a handsome local detective sergeant, brave and adaptable Leah proves to be a strong character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features the intelligent private investigator Spenser, who helps his friend Hawk remove drug dealers from a troubled neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is quick and sharp, and while there are fewer deaths than usual, the story includes more philosophical elements. As always, Parker delivers high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, as they investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's straightforward writing style and keen observation of unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by the husband-and-wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the defender becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book skillfully combines elements of romance, money, and violence to create a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher as the intended victim. A humorous cast of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels that this is not the right direction for his career. While Simon Shaw usually entertains, this shift from dark comedy to farce does not quite meet his usual high standards.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best work in a while. It follows Canadian police as they search for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow and expertly crafted build-up of tension, along with the portrayal of the intelligent but troubled robber, elevates this novel above the typical detective story."
CAE_57,"I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this leap. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 and feeling nervous. I have traveled before; after university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened—I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my paycheck. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 

I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship and don’t have strong career goals, so I feel I should make the most of this freedom—if only for my friends! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the football season to start?” 

Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can handle backpacking again. Will I adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their established lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says there’s a growing realization that adventure is available: “People who always say, ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are realizing they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.”

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance for one last adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I return, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!” 

For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was transformative. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change that mindset to live well as a civilian.” While everyone has different reasons for traveling at this age, there are common themes. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today’s workforce is more flexible. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Some larger companies even have career-break policies, knowing that if they invest in training someone, it’s good to have them return rather than go to a competitor.

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of everyday travelers, notes that more thirty-somethings are reassessing their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job—and many aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t permanent. Travel allows you to step back and think about your life.” 

Is this desire to travel just a sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about just paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he’s not running away. “I’m running towards something. I want to grab opportunities for myself.” But he also feels some anxiety about leaving behind his comfortable routine—going to the office every day, greeting everyone, and enjoying a cup of coffee.

I share Ben’s concerns about leaving a stable life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, “This is common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel.” It may have taken a nudge to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll take pride in having embraced life. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the technological changes. In this piece, she shares how she turned her home into an effective workplace.

Last Christmas, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was lost due to technology. Looking at my resume, I saw I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. I felt that no one would trust me with a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I lacked. I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was known as the family technophobe; even calculators confused me, and I still couldn’t figure out how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to act quickly to fill the gap in my career. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a local newspaper competition and, surprisingly, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I created a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

The children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous, fearing I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn’t very skilled, I learned the basics, and it turned out to be logical and straightforward. With persistence, I improved a little each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk has always been a chaotic mess, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. For a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask for information in journalism forums, and discuss the pros and cons of working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated without physical contact with others. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the kids are home, we often argue over who gets to use the computer. Yet, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment, but also for the convenience of avoiding the daily commute to the city.

As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless in this digital age."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out against the historic backdrop of Edinburgh. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You can't miss the new Museum of Scotland, located at the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh. It features a large yellow sandstone tower and unique, wedge-shaped buildings topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions, with some calling it a ""masterpiece"" and others expressing skepticism. Now, as the inside prepares for its opening, the exhibitions are expected to face similar opinions.

Forget debates about whether the museum tells a national story or follows a chronological order. The answer is yes; it presents a rich tapestry of stories, each linked to important historical objects. There is a timeline to help visitors navigate, but it does not restrict the displays. The museum does not let its national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and Holyrood chapel silver, be overshadowed by national pride.

The main concern, assuming the collections are well-preserved, is whether visitors will find the museum engaging enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that a visit should be enjoyable and visually appealing, aimed at those with little prior knowledge. Despite this openness, Clarke insists on a strict approach to what is displayed. He rejects recreations and imaginative scenes, stating that they misrepresent the past. He believes the public deserves the truth.

At this museum, what you see reflects what experts know. The challenge for visitors is whether the stories of the objects can be communicated effectively through explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, with only about 30 computers available throughout the museum. With less than three days before the opening, it remains uncertain.

Some aspects are clear, though. The stunning views of Edinburgh Castle are breathtaking. Inside, visitors notice a series of interconnected galleries of various sizes and shapes, with pale walls designed to resemble large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light pours in through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space for visitors to reflect on each item.

Thanks to a 12-member Junior board made up of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum includes a Discovery Centre. The group wanted a way to interact with the displays. Although they didn't get that, they succeeded in creating a dedicated hands-on area for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition gallery. As a result, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, set to change every three years. It features a mix of objects chosen by Scottish people and notable figures that have significantly impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is entertaining, it feels somewhat superficial and does not fully address serious topics. However, it may gain depth when the computerized collection of personal stories and memories goes live next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke is correct in saying that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it works well from the inside and the top, but whether it fits its location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"**The Future of Print Media**

The idea of ""transition"" is often seen as a positive change. It suggests moving smoothly from one state to another. However, the transition of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe that this change is inevitable, as print newspaper sales are declining while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, major newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, while their online traffic continues to grow.

However, the situation is more complex than it seems. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies daily. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. Interestingly, news and current affairs magazines have also seen a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend can be observed in the book industry. E-readers like Kindle are becoming very popular, with significant sales growth this year. Yet, when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books over the past six months, they found only a slight decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that both digital and print formats can coexist.

The belief that young people are completely abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe show varying trends. For instance, the UK has seen a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, while Germany's decline is only 7%, and France has experienced a mere 3.1% fall.

These differences indicate that the situation is more complicated than the idea of a digital revolution suggests. In the past, analysts believed that rising online advertising revenues would support the shift to digital newspapers. However, digital ad revenues are now declining, leading many US newspapers to implement paywalls for their content. 

To attract paying readers, some newspapers are offering packages that include both print and digital access. This shows that print remains an important tool for selling online subscriptions, as print advertising generates significantly more revenue than online ads. 

Maintaining both a print edition and a website is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print media still holds a strong presence, and being noticed online is increasingly difficult."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most fascinating subjects for photography. A photo that includes a person is usually more interesting than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Have people stand at different angles and distances, and if possible, at different heights. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Don’t pretend you’re not taking a picture when it’s obvious you are; this can create tension. Most people will agree to have their photo taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo is more powerful if the subject looks directly at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, and remind them just before you take the shot. You can also say something funny to capture a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of direct eye contact, you can have the subject focus on something in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it gives the viewer a sense of observing a moment. Candid shots can be very engaging, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of faces are impactful, the background can add context and interest. When including a background, avoid irrelevant details and focus on what matters. Ensure the subject stands out against the background, perhaps by using a wide-angle lens.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people interact—like talking, laughing, or working together—can lead to great photos. Couples, parents with children, and teams are all good subjects. Look for eye contact or physical connections, like a hand on an arm, to show relationships.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. An elevated camera position can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide the purpose of your photo. If you want a clear memory of someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. However, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, making them more memorable in the future."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means her paintings create an illusion of reality that tricks the eye. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her unique perspective on art.

Unlike many artists, Sarah does not sign her work unless asked. She believes that the artwork itself is what matters, not the artist. She is very modest and almost wants people to think her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her uncomfortable during interviews. When asked about being photographed, she covers her face in embarrassment. However, after some time, she relaxes, and the conversation becomes enjoyable and funny.

Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She trained for two years in drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she found illustration unfulfilling and began working with a well-known decorator, Jim Smart. He encouraged her to try trompe-l'oeil, and she quickly became passionate about it. She decided to start her own business, unsure of where it would lead but feeling it was the right choice.

Her skills in observation and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil art. She believes that trompe-l'oeil cannot be taught; it is learned through life experiences and careful observation. Sarah insists she is still learning and believes that if you think you have mastered something, you should stop.

She is honest about her weaknesses, such as her inability to paint bread realistically. When faced with a large project, like painting a ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she struggled with measurements and questioned her abilities. This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work in a detached way, as if it is done by someone else.

Despite her modesty, Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art is exceptional and stands out from others in the field. She has completed many significant projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that tricks the viewer into thinking they can enter two more rooms.

However, trompe-l'oeil art has a challenge: once the viewer understands the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this and believes that her art must first draw people in and then engage their imagination. She also thinks that trompe-l'oeil should be personal to the client. She enjoys working closely with her clients, as their ideas often inspire her work. Some clients become friends because she spends so much time with them during projects.

Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who allow her creative freedom. They seem happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she downplays her talent. She prefers not to boast about herself, saying she is reserved and does not want her work to be loud. While this may be true, her art and personality are anything but boring. Her work deserves more recognition, and I am willing to promote it, even if she might not like it."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the important 'people skills' needed to succeed in our careers.

A. The workplace is changing. We are now evaluated not only on our intelligence and skills but also on how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is increasingly used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who is likely to excel and who may not. Regardless of our current jobs, these criteria are essential for our future employability. They focus less on academic performance and more on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—collectively known as emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For years, these traits have been referred to by various names, such as 'character' and 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This term generally means the ability to understand and manage our own emotions and those of others, using feelings to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people mistakenly think it only means being nice, but it can also involve confronting someone with difficult truths when necessary. It is not about expressing feelings freely but managing them effectively to help teams work together towards common goals.

C. More companies recognize that fostering emotional intelligence is vital for effective management. The more complex a job is, the more important emotional intelligence becomes. A lack of these skills can limit a person's ability to use their technical knowledge effectively. While some individuals have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that promote teamwork gain a competitive advantage. In today's work environment, where teamwork and customer focus are essential, emotional intelligence is crucial for success in every job worldwide.

D. Unlike IQ, which remains relatively stable, emotional intelligence can develop throughout our lives as we learn from experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often referred to as maturity. Not only can we learn these skills, but we can also add them to our toolkit for navigating our careers, especially in a time when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human aspect can hinder overall effectiveness."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media profit from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has truly changed citizen photography. As news often breaks on social networks, some journalists now use these platforms for images during fast-moving events. However, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there is guidance stating that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, the question of whether this is ethical is still debated. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, highlighting the significant role of UGC in the future of media. To maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that individuals are fairly compensated for their work and that permission is always obtained.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old and comes from traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, physical manipulation, and exercise. While acupuncture can treat various health issues, it is particularly noted for its effectiveness in pain relief. Many general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it for this purpose.

**Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine**

Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, known as Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to a specific organ, and many smaller ones that deliver Qi to every cell. When the flow of Qi is disrupted, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a consultation, an acupuncturist will assess your Qi by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and looking at your overall health. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and lifestyle habits like eating and sleeping.

**Acupuncture Points**

The acupuncture points are linked to the meridians and may not be located near the area of pain. Patients often report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done manually or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists believe that this sensation indicates the needle has connected with the Qi in the meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less frequently.

**Scientific Understanding of Acupuncture**

While Western doctors may not accept all aspects of traditional Chinese medicine, many acknowledge that acupuncture can help relieve pain. Scientific studies suggest that acupuncture may work by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain or by releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Acupuncture is often sought by people with chronic pain when other treatments have failed. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-surgery pain. Acupuncturists also claim it can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Applications of Acupuncture**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over two millennia, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped some Western doctors recognize its potential. In China today, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, including tonsillectomies and heart surgeries. It can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or alongside medications. While some patients report significant pain relief, experiences can vary. Acupuncturists argue that acupuncture has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia, such as nausea, and allows for quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**

Clinical trials on acupuncture can be challenging, but studies show that 50 to 80 percent of patients find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate, although they acknowledge that it may not work for everyone. They suggest that patients with long-term pain may need six to seven sessions to feel significant relief, but some improvement can often be noticed after just two or three visits.

**A Holistic Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, meaning they consider the whole person rather than just specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the issue and looking for underlying problems in the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect the pain, such as weather conditions or the nature of the pain itself. This comprehensive approach is not typically used by most medical doctors.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using their methods can lead to deeper healing, which is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she carries an air of quiet confidence. One could easily imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she had not chosen to write detective stories filled with unexpected twists. However, it quickly becomes clear that her confident demeanor is a cover for her shyness. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh prefers to solve crimes alone, just like James prefers to write in solitude. She needs complete privacy to write, no matter where she is.

Despite her success, she is too humble to agree that she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, even though millions read her twelve major detective novels worldwide. She admires the work of her close friend Ruth Rendell, especially her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. The books she enjoys most are often by female authors like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers great novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published, and she is now in her seventies. Born in Oxford, she grew up mainly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11. It was there that she met her husband, a university student, and she chose Cambridge as the setting for one of her novels, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.

James has faced many challenges in her life. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work long hours to support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she struggled to find the time to write. Fortunately, her husband's parents helped care for the children, providing them with stability during tough times.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills effectively. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent eleven years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. During her time in forensic science, she became accustomed to seeing dead bodies, but her interest was not in death itself. Instead, she was drawn to the structure and craft of writing a crime novel. 

James has always loved reading detective stories and knew she wanted to be a writer. She did not want to write about her own traumatic experiences, so she found writing detective stories to be a great way to learn the craft of serious novel writing while keeping her personal life separate. Over time, she realized that it was possible to follow the traditional format of a detective story while still creating a meaningful novel about human nature. For her, writing detective stories is a way to bring order to chaos, and solving a crime reinforces the value of life, even if that life is difficult. She believes that no one truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can significantly influence whether you are considered suitable for the position. Handwriting analysis, known as graphology, is recognized as a legitimate science in many places. Researchers suggest it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can also reveal psychological conditions and emotional problems. 

Graphology is increasingly used for career guidance and as a supplement to job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the effectiveness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes it deserves more attention. She argues that handwriting can reflect psychological traits and some medical conditions. According to her, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental abilities, whether someone should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a manipulative or honest character.""

Ms. Marne claims that graphology can be especially useful in identifying potential criminal behavior. She notes that criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly formed and sometimes childish. Many criminals come from disadvantaged backgrounds and show signs of emotional development issues, which can be reflected in their handwriting. She states, ""I can determine if people are honest, manipulative, or trustworthy."" 

Young male offenders often have tall letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can also predict if someone is likely to become violent, if they are under extreme stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even indicate potential suicide risks. Ms. Marne explains that heart and lung issues can also be detected through handwriting. While one sample may not provide enough information, changes in handwriting over time, such as a previously stable signature becoming shaky, can signal serious problems. A significant emotional upset can also temporarily alter a person's signature.

Ms. Marne describes how handwriting can reveal various psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect like threads may be clever but deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting, or how much it differs from standard script, indicates confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often signifies someone who prefers solitude. Very small signatures can show feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter ""i"" indicate a desire for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can suggest intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Ms. Marne believes that it takes six years of study and practice to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She feels more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific discipline, and she is optimistic that this will happen soon. She claims, ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without needing to ask potentially misleading questions.""

Despite these intriguing claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the writing style taught, and that it holds no deeper significance."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and comfortable chairs are essential for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a recent survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their assessments.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very basic, with no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and windows that open directly to the street. Surprisingly, the small team of seven seems happy and has few complaints. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to how they would at home. This may be the reason for their happiness: they have created a comfortable, homely work environment without unnecessary rules.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and often creates poor posture. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule that includes office work, client meetings, and presentations, which helps prevent fatigue and boredom.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The team enjoys the variety of tasks and the office's flexibility. They feel the office is ""just the right size""—small enough to know what everyone is doing, yet large enough to focus on individual work. The office is attractive and promotes both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be exciting, but it is comfortable and staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, partly due to a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with plain grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most employees have been there for over five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by rearranging desks to facilitate information sharing and displaying project updates on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office receives mixed reviews. It feels like being in a glass case, with many people around. Despite having both smokers and non-smokers, the air quality is acceptable, and smoke is not noticeable even close to a smoker.

- **Ergonomist:** The office design is standard and uninspiring. The desks are barely adequate, and not all chairs meet ergonomic standards. Computer screens are often placed on low desks, which is not suitable for modern equipment.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. The office has many communication awards on display, but the wood paneling and brown carpet create a dull atmosphere. However, the office is busy and active.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many issues. The air conditioning is poorly controlled, leading to uncomfortable temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most employees have insufficient desk space. It is also very dusty, with dust collecting in many areas.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is more suitable for a workshop than an office. Many chairs are old and do not provide proper support for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 meters. 

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old, dirty chairs and carpets, and there is a lot of dust. There is much room for improvement, including better air conditioning and recognition of individual achievements. During our visit, there were few conversations, and everyone seemed stressed and overwhelmed by deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, accessible to everyone, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks every day. This ancient practice has turned into a big business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today’s gum is mostly made from synthetic materials, including pine resins and softeners that help maintain flavor and improve texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, marking the beginning of commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic, leading to the growth of a new industry. However, efforts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the demand for chewing gum increased, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, struggle to make a living. They trek for miles to collect sap from scattered sapodilla trees in very humid conditions. Their work environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects, including a fly that lays eggs in their ears and noses. Despite these risks, experienced chicleros climb trees quickly to cut the bark and collect the sap in bags. They then carry the sap to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is formed into bricks. Life at the camp is tough, with a boring diet mainly of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. 

Even though this work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have shifted to synthetic ingredients to lower costs and meet demand.

Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. They claim that chewing gum helps people relax, boosts energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were regularly given gum. One of the main benefits of gum is that it can help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but our saliva can neutralize this acid and provide minerals like calcium and fluoride, which protect our teeth. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva production.

Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to make the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - Ghanerao Hotel, Rajasthan**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the peacefulness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The hotel offers basic facilities, with hot water provided in buckets, but these simple conditions add to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - Hermitage Hotel, Mount Cook**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I discovered it by chance while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we had to walk down. To my surprise, we found this hotel at the bottom, set in stunning, wild countryside. Arriving tired and battered to find such luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter, was an unforgettable experience.

**C. MAURITIUS - Paradis Hotel**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. Although the hotel is large and offers many free water sports, you can easily find solitude on its nine kilometers of private beach. Swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, and the hotel will be hidden behind palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the peacefulness as the sun sets.

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector who evaluates hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection. Just one minute into the annual check, problems are already starting for the Globe Hotel, although the staff are unaware of it. The receptionist is busy giving room rates over the phone to a potential guest and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue quietly comments, ""She hasn't even acknowledged us. Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She notes that the Globe Hotel is not just an ordinary three-star hotel; it has three red stars, which means it is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for. 

However, even before they receive a cold welcome, the atmosphere feels off. The entrance from the car park is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor to the hotel entrance. Sue remarks, ""This is not what I expected."" 

Things get worse when the receptionist informs them, ""We have no record of your booking,"" in a cheerful tone. It turns out that out of the hotel's 15 rooms, 12 are empty that night. One room is on the top floor, but Sue finds it stuffy and notices a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. Early in her career, she earned a reputation for being tough, and she recalls being called ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and didn't think she was that tough.

The next morning, after paying her bill, Sue reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks terrified. Before she says anything, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge, explaining, ""We think there's a blocked drain."" Sue kindly suggests that he should also instruct his staff to be more careful about showing guests to that lounge. Greaves nods and takes notes, looking worried. He has only been at the Globe for five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback is meant to help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything is negative, though. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who provided information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the standards to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which encourages Greaves to ask, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue responds, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves’ hopeful expression fades.

Sue’s job is to express the complaints that many customers are too afraid to voice. She recalls a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired, but all Sue could say was that he served her apple pie with his fingers. She often receives letters with false accusations, which can be hurtful, but she has learned to expect them.

Sue must not only share her findings verbally with the hotel manager but also send a detailed written report, as the hotels pay for her evaluations. Despite the challenges, being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. It is good news for Greaves that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. However, the bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to ensure that improvements have been made. Greaves smiles weakly and says, ""We'll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,"**Seven Summits: Doug Scott's Climbing Journey**

Doug Scott, an experienced mountaineer, shares his incredible experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit, Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, had a strange conversation about sleeping bags, even though they were alone. Doug thought this was due to a lack of oxygen. He started talking to his own feet, which were getting cold, reminding him of climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug reflected on their time on the summit ridge and felt grateful to have Dougal with him, as he inspired confidence. Doug focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit, which he successfully did.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Considered one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier in April 1976. They spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized how challenging their climb would be. They followed a route established in 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a first for this area. After facing tough conditions, including a wet sleeping bag and strong winds, they finally reached the summit, feeling victorious.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite planned to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro due to a free ride. They got lost in the dense jungle, which was concerning because water was scarce. On the second day, they found a trail marked by arrows and some litter, leading them to a rock pool. They attempted a direct climb but faced falling rocks and ice, so they wisely chose a different route to reach the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met fellow climber Phil Erscheler. Phil suggested they join his group to climb Aconcagua via the Polish Glacier, avoiding the busy standard route. After waiting out bad weather, they set off. The glacier was icy and challenging, so they decided to take the north ridges instead. They joined many others on the standard route and reached the summit just before dark.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never set, creating a unique atmosphere. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg and traveled to Terskol, near Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they took a cable car to 3,900 meters and then walked to a refuge at 4,200 meters. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they had reached the summit but discovered there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team aimed to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about potential dangers from bandits but decided to proceed. On May 12, they began climbing, and as the weather improved, two team members moved ahead while Doug and Sham took their time. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

Style influences many aspects of our lives today, from clothing to home decor and accessories. Jo Foley shares some of the fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to steer clear of traditional, stiff designs and overly frilly styles, opting instead for simpler looks. Ingham has been sketching and designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he attended fashion school, where he learned how to cut and make clothes. However, you don’t need to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening gowns in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, a staple in women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh, contemporary twist.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail previously worked for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery design. She began creating her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to start her own design business in 1990. Now, her jewellery is popular among many celebrities. Her signature style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Just four years after launching her career in the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson has had two of her designs chosen for a major exhibition. Despite only taking an introductory art and design course, her bags always attract attention. All of Grimson's handbags are handmade in the UK. They are not just practical; they exude glamour, whether made from luxurious calfskin or rich silk. The combination of style and quality makes a Grimson bag truly special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He understands that most women want a natural look that they can manage at home. His unique approach ensures that clients don’t look like they just left a salon. However, this relaxed style comes at a price—£250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Leveraging his celebrity status, Peter has created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who can’t visit his salon to achieve their desired looks at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and also works as a consultant for a large supermarket chain, providing floral ideas for top restaurants. Remarkably, she has no formal qualifications in floristry and left her teaching job ten years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern and simple floral arrangements have won numerous design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also enjoyed successful lecture tours in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements today should be simple yet striking, avoiding excessive leaves, which can be too large and overpowering. For wedding bouquets, she emphasizes that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin has been created after extensive research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This approach has allowed the hotel to incorporate the latest technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to keep track of their preferences. This system helps the hotel provide a special experience for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common complaint among hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will particularly appreciate the technology in their rooms. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. To meet their needs, the hotel has transformed the traditional business center into individual rooms equipped with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities.

Given the rapid pace of technological change, the hotel has prepared for future upgrades by installing extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy replacement with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated as needed.

Despite all this advanced technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are both cozy and inviting. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

As with all luxury hotels, the food must be exceptional. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who already had two Michelin stars for his Dublin restaurant, has moved his business to the Merrion. This move has allowed him to design a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant on-site is a great advantage with minimal financial risk. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_24,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the plants I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to create detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting gradually. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and it's a hectic time,"" she says. However, she finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in, put them in water, and after a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always had a passion for plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in florists. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden features many plants from distant lands, which seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"**No Title**

In March, strong storms caused many trees in the Brackham area to fall. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. This change upset many residents who preferred the town's traditional look. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have shared their frustration. However, during the storm, he was too unwell to notice anything. For the first time, he was seriously ill with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. But he believed the police needed him and ignored her advice, trying to continue working. This decision made him forgetful and irritable. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor, and he was too weak to argue. Soon after, he got his antibiotics and returned home, where Molly sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen, he struggled to understand. Later that evening, he weakly asked if their house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then covered himself with sheets. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked and his fever went down, that he noticed the walnut tree's absence had changed the living room's appearance. 

The Pelhams lived in a large house with a big garden, which they had bought without regrets. The garden had given them a sense of privacy. However, the storm changed that. Before, the living room had a beautiful view of the walnut tree, which created interesting light patterns and hid the worn furniture they had brought from their old home. Now, without the tree, the room felt harshly bright, revealing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was also unpleasant. The tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, now loomed over them with its unattractive purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham asked his wife weakly. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. ""I've been saying this since we moved in. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. This snow almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. However, in the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. The wind blew fiercely up there, while in our valley, we only felt sudden gusts that made the trees sway, but their branches remained strong.

Despite the inconvenience of the snow and wind, we were more worried about the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by a series of dams built many years ago. Soon, the snow began to melt, and we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These ominous grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we focused on the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The melting snow was washed away by heavy rain, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and nearing a dangerous level.

Then it happened—after many years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls as the water surged over the dam and rushed into the stream below. The river seemed furious as the water poured down towards its lower stretches. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream looked wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it, angrily pushing against its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below the dam. Luckily, our hopes were fulfilled as the dam held, and the water began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the huge clouds above the valley and appreciate the river's tremendous power, knowing that our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing film articles for this newspaper was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviews of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also had experience in radio and television. He hired me, but since Tom was not mainly a journalist, he might not have been very careful in choosing his team. 

Initially, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need specialized knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to keep the atmosphere friendly. At that time, it felt like a dream to be part of a new newspaper in a competitive market. I even thought it was unlikely that a millionaire would want to help me personally and was pretending to hire me, reflecting my low self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with my review, I felt very awkward.

Tom's idea of a team of critics didn’t work out as planned. Although it was a good concept, we didn’t meet as expected, and most communication happened over the phone. It became clear that the public preferred to associate a reviewer with a specific subject, so I decided to focus on film. Without Tom's initial encouragement, we might not have developed the current system, where I write a detailed weekly piece about one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn’t enjoy the typical role of a film critic, which involves reviewing every new release. That routine would quickly make me feel bored, and I would dread going to screenings, thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?"" 

The freedom I have allows me to expand my arguments or, during a dull week, to create something interesting from little material. But what is my role in the public eye? I believe people choose films based on stars, marketing, or the director. There is also a tendency for viewers to stick to their preferences. It’s rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a critic's opinion. So, if a film review isn’t really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel responsible for being ""right"" about a movie, nor do I think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. My job is simply to present an argument. I’m not a judge, and I wouldn’t want to be one."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

A teenager who loves sports is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably female. This is a chance to work with someone who could be an Olympic champion. The partner should be very enthusiastic about distance running (regular 15 km sessions), distance swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (a love for 100 km rides is helpful). It is essential to be able to do all three activities without taking a break.

Triathlons are becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. They attract large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. While it may be exciting for spectators, what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, has not yet learned the common phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes use when asked about their motivations. She explains, ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike while still wet. Of course, you get cold. After the 40 km bike ride, you have to run 10 km, which feels long when you’re tired. But it’s really fun, and it’s all worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, but she was the only junior participant. Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we found ourselves at the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried during the run."" However, she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would end, but I’m afraid that if I stop even once, I would want to stop again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, while most people would step off when they realize they can’t go any further. She just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but I was much slower in cycling. That’s why I’m working hard to improve."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay £1,300 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (which is a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, there is a cost to her dedication. Her intense training has made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she admits. ""I’m not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do keep in touch with the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times and achievements.""

Where will this strong focus lead Melanie? She has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" which involves swimming 750 meters, cycling 20 kilometers, and running 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher competitions than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I don’t have anyone my age to train with,"" she says. It’s interesting, isn’t it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember this: only collect items you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. Attracted by their shapes and colors, these pebbles were among the first objects gathered for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed; children still collect stones and seashells simply for their beauty.

I have been a collector all my life, gathering everything from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I was sent to a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by others. I was captivated by these items. 

Interestingly, I am not alone in my interest; many adults share this passion. Researchers believe that for some, collecting is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, it is simply a joyful activity. 

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like coconut shell cups and carved ivory beads. Another notable collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected various items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, with great determination. 

I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, looking at the ruins of my furniture and collection, unsure which loss hurt more.

What fascinates me is how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet adds value to items traded in markets. As certain objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now considered valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I regret throwing away both the boxes and the toys!)"

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I research the exhibition topic and talk to key people to understand the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and images to display and ensure the public can grasp the ideas behind the exhibition. This involves planning interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I also coordinate with engineers and electricians to ensure the exhibition is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents to help students learn the routes needed to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, around 50 students are in class, figuring out the best routes, including one-way streets and turns. I step in when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they approach the test, I give them a simple route but challenge them to find alternatives when roads are closed. This encourages them to think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and mostly work from home. My job involves answering phone inquiries, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. I occasionally visit our main office, but I mainly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about marine life. I take them out to sea to help them understand the underwater environment better, which often changes their perspectives. I feel fortunate because conservation is my passion, but working for a charity means I constantly seek funding, which limits what I can achieve.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite diverse. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain a stock of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. Working with a dedicated team makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**No Title**

Every June, we traveled to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It’s a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did so very tastefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us by seeing an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to promote it. One evening, he suggested it and read the details to us. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was a disappointment because the food was terrible.

The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, although my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is probably why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it’s a funny coincidence.

“Welcome back,” Mrs. Malseed said, smiling as she greeted us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. “Arthur, take the luggage up,” she instructed the old porter. She referred to our rooms by the names of flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when few guests come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of small details like that, while her husband handles repairs and redecorating.

“Welcome, welcome!” Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. He greeted us in the Irish way, smiling broadly with his twinkling brown eyes, making us feel special, not just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was perfect. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. “You look younger every year!” she said, making everyone laugh again.

Arthur led us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play too long because we were still tired from our journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other guests at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the cliff path to the beach. 

In the morning, we planned to walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this routine well because over the years, we had developed this pattern. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."
FCE_67,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in traditional wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a great way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. After having her own breakfast, she prepares breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. By 9:30 a.m., after the guests have finished eating, she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By around 11 a.m., she is ready to ski, taking advantage of the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes starting the next day in a messy space. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful,"" she notes, while acknowledging that some weeks are more challenging.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start their night at a place called Bananas, then might visit G Jay's and finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, especially when she has to cook breakfast with a headache.

On Sundays, she starts work earlier, preparing breakfast for guests leaving by 7 a.m. Once they leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast and changing beds to get everything ready for new guests. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new arrivals, who usually come around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which she finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. Soon, it's time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but if she's too tired, she prefers to go to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she claimed to be six years older. One day, she visited his factory wearing overalls and large shoes, with her curly hair framing her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

Several times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed particularly serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to learn how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how fascinated Marie had been by the steam-heated brass hands used to shape the gloves, which she called ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" she said. 

""You should visit one if you want to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. Tanneries are basic places. The technology has improved, but they still look similar to how they did hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; they found 6,000-year-old tanning relics in Turkey. The first clothing was just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is a leather expert; you should talk to him. If you mention gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers are passionate about their work.""

""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" he asked.

""I can't say I have,"" she replied.

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" 

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child.""

He laughed, enjoying her spirit and eagerness to learn. Rita reminded him of Marie, who was much taller and fairer but shared the same bright intelligence. 

""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will take you through the entire glove-making process. Come on! We’re going to make you a pair of gloves, and you’ll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""
FCE_71,"**Is It a Tough Job?** Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss, but there is one small issue—she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde, which felt too cramped with its small windows. When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London, handling routine tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning itineraries, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group’s manager led to her working behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he prefers caddying, especially since golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, with average earnings between £25,000 and £35,000, much of which goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You're not just carrying bags; you're giving advice, using your knowledge, and trying to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, which made him a statistical data administrator. He compiles and analyzes statistics from the caddies' scorecards, which are valuable to television commentators, golf magazines, and the players themselves.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to taste food at top restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. Having been a farmer, I knew about the problem of chickens being killed by a fox, so I wrote a story called *The Fox Busters*, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard at them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don’t wake up at dawn, though. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning—all with one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop, which I dislike. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but I now have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Surrounding it were large piles of soft sawdust, creating golden mounds that reached down to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted, calling them cowards to encourage them to join him.

Still laughing, he watched as they hesitated on the roof, looking scared. One by one, they jumped down, relieved to land safely. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes until one of them suggested going back up to the roof to jump again. Although they were not very excited, they climbed back up and began jumping off in a determined way. Soon, only Michael was left on the roof, while the others grinned up at him, urging him to jump. 

Michael wanted to join them but stayed at the edge, nervously licking his lips and smiling foolishly, wondering why the drop seemed so much longer this time. At first, they thought he was just joking, but then they noticed him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but when that didn’t work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. As time passed, the boys grew tired of waiting and started to shout at him, calling him a coward and asking if he planned to stay up there all night. When he still didn’t move, they began to walk away, still teasing him.

""Who started this?"" he called after them. But he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He stayed there alone for nearly an hour while the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were damp from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone.

He arrived so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you can’t, maybe you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a hint of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. Although she spoke firmly, Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, hardly heard her. He was still thinking about the grinning faces of his friends and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change their careers are turning to career advisers. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. After this, you will receive a summary of the results, along with suggested career options and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest career advice organizations. Taking the career test felt like being back in a science exam. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that this was not about passing or failing. It was difficult to see how the psychometric tests could accurately reflect who I am. The tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, although I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are relieved I didn’t become a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean making a huge shift. Last March, after losing her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney sought help from Career Analysts. She said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to step back and review my career. I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But in the end, I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial responsibilities,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, she decided to use her existing skills and move into a field that suited her better than insurance. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she truly wanted to do. She has recommended the service to several friends, all of whom are satisfied.

Not everyone finds career advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I felt lost. I thought a career adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either meant a significant pay cut or required a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had shared the same information with a friend, they would have given her similar advice."
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental clinic in the center of Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he examines their teeth. Jerome explains, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has worked to create a space where people feel comfortable. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, as many people link it to pain. His belief is that dental visits should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This approach may surprise many, as most people associate dental visits with discomfort or clinical settings. Jerome believes that if patients feel relaxed and entertained, they will forget their past negative experiences. One of his innovative relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular,"" he says. During the initial check-up, patients sit comfortably on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while he examines their teeth. The headset then switches to a special camera that gives patients a visual tour of their mouth.

Interestingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their dental visit. Another important aspect is that the clinic smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it has a pleasant orange scent. Jerome explains, ""When people enter, I want them to experience with all their senses that this is not a typical dentist visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the clinic very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the top priority. For instance, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It may feel a bit unusual at first, but as long as patients are relaxed, it is not painful.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned is that making things easier for the patient also makes it easier for the dentist,"" he explains. He believes his patient-focused approach is part of a gradual shift towards a more relaxed style in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly greets him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently guides him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this luxurious treatment, and it’s easy to see why. The clinic feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is now a multi-million pound global industry. During Easter, British people spend over £230 million on chocolate, with eight percent of all chocolate sales happening at this time. Only Christmas sees more chocolate consumption. 

Although large-scale chocolate production started in the last century, the cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often mistakenly called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also referred to as cacoa and cocao beans.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in the Aztec language, Nahuatl. This chocolate drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it more enjoyable when mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but this recipe did not reach the rest of Europe for another hundred years.

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid block. A Swiss company later added milk solids, leading to the creation of milk chocolate.

At the turn of the century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. However, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising that linked it to the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside, making it a competitor to luxurious French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars per week, prompting manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One recent marketing strategy is the ""extended line,"" where traditional chocolate bars are transformed into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something new.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, consider the challenges faced by those who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master in his craft. He still has many interests, such as paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells. As he shows me around his apartment, he asks, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is clearly the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I’ve grown so fond of them. I never intended to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so people could see my art. They even spoke to a gallery owner."" This led to a successful exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. Given the high prices—around £2,000 for the ornaments—Cooke seems willing to sacrifice the empty space above his fireplace.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else creates work like his, and as the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

Cooke wishes he had started this art earlier in life, as he feels he could have created even more wonderful things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels physically limited compared to when he began. However, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led to boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own methods and uses materials as he finds them. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he explains. Yet, the detail, color variations, and symmetry in his work look very intentional.

Cooke's search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him beyond his local beaches in Norfolk to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against critics who accuse him of damaging the beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them much faster than I can gather them. The ones left behind are broken by the sea. I would never collect shells with living creatures in them or dive for them. But once the creatures have left, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty of his work often exceeds the natural beauty of the shells themselves."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer, a 15-year-old model, balances her time between traveling to exciting places and studying for school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares her story.

When I arrived at the agency, the receptionist informed me that Kira would be late. I tried to ignore the negative stereotypes I had heard about models, such as being difficult or vain. I worried about how late she might be—would it be an hour or more? What if she preferred to go to the hairdresser instead of meeting me? If she rushed in, she might be in a bad mood and unwilling to talk. 

However, when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, finally arrived, she was smiling, calm, and accompanied by her mother. She wore a simple black dress and trainers, showing no signs of arrogance. Kira was just a friendly, tall, and pretty girl. Since models under 16 must have an adult with them, her mother, who looked proud of her daughter, was there too.

Kira seemed a bit confused by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. ""She saw the competition and told me to join,"" Kira recalled. ""I said no, but she sent in some photos anyway."" When she learned she was a finalist, she was at school. This achievement boosted her confidence, and she performed well, winning the competition. The Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Now, Kira finds it challenging to manage her two lives. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some classmates make rude comments about her success, saying she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this difficult to handle, especially since she is not self-important. ""They think that because I became a model, I can't stay the same. The only change is that I am more confident, but not in a bad way. I can stand up for myself more.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't promise to join them because I don’t know my schedule. I can’t make plans, and sometimes they get canceled, but my friends understand. They don’t complain about me being busy with modeling.""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a successful career ahead of her, even before finishing her school exams. As I wrapped up the interview with this remarkable girl, I asked what she would like to do if she didn’t have her beauty. She paused and said, ""I’d like to do what you’re doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the warm lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are sure they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

They have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their journey began when Terence read about gold worth millions hidden in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While studying 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the most promising land to explore. After clearing away plants and discovering pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent the last ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running low on money. Having spent their savings on this dream, they need to convince an investor to contribute £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, but we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys last week, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are successful, it could bring more visitors here, but I hope millions of people don’t come and disturb the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It’s adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I’ll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which involves studying the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she descends into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration, diving three kilometers down to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are accustomed to these cramped conditions, where they cannot stand or move freely, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last up to 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency and they need to ascend quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. Rachel notes, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.""

Rachel recalls her first experience in the vehicle. She climbed in on a ship's deck with an instructor, who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a confined space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands, where there is a large area of underwater volcanoes releasing black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the impact of a multinational program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on the 'black smokers,'"" another term for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel describes a frightening moment during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment with a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were overwhelmed with relief— they were still alive!

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD, and seeing them in person was an incredible experience."""
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with foreign train schedules, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I told myself as I returned home. I repeated this promise the following year and the year after that. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month.

Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. Carrying all your belongings in a rucksack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that have become too dirty or getting rid of books after reading them. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail experience, where common sense can be set aside along with your paperback and socks. All it takes to feel this freedom is one of those tickets in your hand. A system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is quite special.

On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize the full potential of this train ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling non-stop was too appealing, as there was always another country just beyond the border. And the extra miles? They cost us nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. We focused on the most accessible sights, enjoying the chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station.

We were just trying to get by and have fun, just like most other Inter-Railers with whom we shared train corridors, food, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from experiencing a place that was once just a name. It feels like the city you arrive in didn’t exist until the train pulls into the station, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by witnessing Europe firsthand, observing the changing landscapes and different lifestyles, can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means little until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be so dull. While the train journey may not reveal new discoveries about the world, it offers a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail provides the best chance to appreciate this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in inappropriate clothing. Although airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, it is a common issue that frequent travelers will eventually face. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and it is impossible for any airline to guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially when your journey involves changing planes.

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which is meant to give enough time for luggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to switch between two flights, and these times are also extended to allow for luggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which can disrupt the baggage system. Human error or accidents, such as a destination label getting torn off, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For instance, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million of them changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to transfer between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-haul flights).

Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have their bad days. The risk of losing luggage during plane changes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is particularly known for luggage going missing when transatlantic passengers connect to flights in Latin America.

To reduce the chances of losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all legs of your journey. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, muddy browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a peaceful atmosphere, much like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, leaving a strong impression even after it disappears in an instant. 

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep affection for this small bird is shown by his uncertainty about what exactly attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is said to be a moon goddess who transformed into a bird. Another story claims that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this tale. Despite the various shades of blue in their feathers, kingfishers do not have any blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers. Their vibrant colors, combined with the fact that these birds are shy but can be observed from a distance, create a perfect opportunity for photographers. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he draped over himself while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him another four years to capture his first good photograph. During this time, the European kingfisher became a major part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream rich with kingfishers, but school limited his time with the birds. He missed classes and considered himself an ""academic failure."" Nevertheless, his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, then became an assistant to the editor, and eventually worked as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the ultimate kingfisher film: ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I’m drawn to a simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still captivate him. His photographs convey some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever express."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from New Conductors**

Giving directions to an orchestra is a challenging task. Anne Inglis interviews five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, had a unique opportunity when she asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant and was later invited to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous; I have always felt confident in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a significant competition in 1991 after two unsuccessful attempts. Looking back, he feels fortunate about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have been forgotten."" The competition opened many doors for him, including a position as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being labeled as a competition winner: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned."" Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. ""If that doesn't happen, my career could suffer.""

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. A turning point for her was starting lessons with Sian Edwards. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size, unlike the larger conductors I had learned from before. This made a big difference."" Kani appreciates the complexity of opera, noting, ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, describes his journey into conducting as surprising but fascinating. He began as a resident musician at an opera house and learned from skilled conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's *Agrippina* from the piano at a festival, which was a new experience for him. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and had a clear vision of how I wanted it to sound. I tried my best to achieve that. Thankfully, people respect my overall musical ability. I draw from all my past experiences, both in musical style and performance. Now, I am open to any opportunities to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and recommended him to his agent. Now 32, Marshall found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He had to manage some relaxed professional musicians who were reading newspapers during the performance. ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best results. Many orchestral musicians I’ve encountered don’t seem to need much guidance from a conductor. But I’m not afraid to express my needs. If people see you’re anxious, it only makes things worse. I have never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to do it, but I have received kindness from others. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are considering taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is also a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides, like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use a better atmosphere and nicer scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were unsure what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings that he could explore! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we felt there was still more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, which looked like it would get you wet, but it didn’t. For younger children, Toy Land was a lot of fun. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not boring. It was very clean, and the staff were excellent. When I couldn’t sit with both girls on one ride, a staff member kindly offered to accompany one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I’m not very brave, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t try the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children had been a bit older, they might have found it less exciting, but they were the right age and enjoyed it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we definitely felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie found the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on multiple times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We noticed that the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World, and we wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Since she had experience with computers, her husband encouraged her to start this business. Although it required a lot of money and was challenging at first, she managed her finances carefully and communicated with her bank manager about spending. Working from home saves her money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. Her business remains small, and most customers pick up their orders directly.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum. However, after moving to the countryside, she decided to start her own business, creating a collection of 50 cards that she sells to museums. She works in a large room upstairs but finds it hard to focus because there are always household tasks to do, like mowing the lawn. Maggy does not advertise; her business relies entirely on word of mouth. She receives orders from London because her prices are lower than those of other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she believes the benefits of working alone outweigh the drawbacks.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has experienced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. At one point, she employed six full-time curtain-makers, but due to an economic downturn, she had to let them go, which was difficult because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and collaborates with women who work from their homes. Delia has learned to lower her prices when necessary and to explore new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the rural lifestyle. Tessa enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants, but 80% of her income comes from international deals, which means she often takes calls at unusual hours. She finds it challenging to maintain discipline and close her office door. Tessa publishes children's books that reflect various cultures and collaborates with authors and artists. Initially, she felt isolated because all her professional experience was in London.

E. **Meg Rivers** operates a cakes-by-post business and a shop that generates £250,000 a year, employing six people, some of whom work part-time. She started her business ten years ago from home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. After receiving requests from friends and family, she began shipping cakes across the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where all the baking is done, employing a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg no longer bakes herself, as she now manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as she did not have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they have musicians and an instrument maker. John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their son Paul, who was ten years old at the time. However, they found that cellos were very expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years.

After making several violins and violas, John finally made his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers that it turned out great. John later made another cello for Paul, which he used until recently. John has now retired from teaching and works full-time as a craftsman, making about twelve violins each year. One of his violins was sold to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo, which was a big achievement for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother Huw were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano: ""As soon as I could reach the keys, I played,"" he recalls. Eventually, he was drawn to the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin because John played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. Paul tried the violin for a short time but preferred the cello after being inspired by a cellist in his father's group.

Huw, now 22, also found his own path in music as a pianist and composer. He appreciated the support from his parents and felt motivated by Paul's achievements rather than pressured.

Paul has had great success with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. He played his father's cello until recently when he borrowed a 304-year-old cello by Francesco Rugeri from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul jokes that his father's cello might need many years to develop the same sound quality as the Rugeri.

Soon, Paul will perform on television, playing Elgar's Cello Concerto. He believes that his performance will be unique, regardless of the piece's famous history. However, he won't be able to watch himself on TV because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, one of the wardens who helps care for the beautiful areas owned by the Trust.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. ""You are always interacting with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies,"" he explains. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. Around 80 people applied for the position of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. Gareth got the job because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he did not have formal training. 

He finds it helpful to still farm with his parents, as it allows him to relate to farmers and understand their challenges. ""They can't fool me!"" he says. His farming background also helps him handle the physical aspects of the job, such as building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers, butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests as a child. Recently, he wondered where he could find those things now. He realizes that farming has changed the countryside, but he believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government advice.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. Both groups wanted things done their own way. Now, they are communicating and understanding each other's perspectives. ""We are at a turning point, and it only takes a small step to bring them together,"" Gareth says. 

Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My job is to ensure tasks are completed efficiently and with minimal fuss. I enjoy seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork,"" he explains. 

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys every moment, especially interacting with the public. However, he admits that some visitors can be frustrating. ""Some people come in, demand everything, and leave as if they have a right to it. Being polite to them can be annoying!"" he says. 

In the end, Gareth believes it all comes down to common sense. If you have plenty of that and enjoy working outdoors, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just don’t expect a position to open up in the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. When I spoke with her, she was busy preparing for the World Championships next month. Her day included teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her if people stared at her while she trained. She replied, ""I’m so focused on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slowing down out of the corner of my eye, but that’s it.""

Kendra explained, ""My entire life right now is about being at my best for the Championships. I follow a strict schedule to get as fit as possible."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it promises to be the largest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always won against them, but they will be exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" Currently, the England team is ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra warns that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only get one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose. But once the game is over, we become friends again."" 

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It’s crucial that we all think and train like world-class players. As captain, I believe it’s important to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra mentioned, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned everything carefully. I decided a while ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their abilities. Some parents might not recognize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help academically gifted children, musically talented kids often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is seen as less important.

Children who show musical talent, especially those encouraged by their parents or teachers, can benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established recently. These schools create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen, allowing them to develop their musical skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend a significant part of their day—between one third and one half—on music-related activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is dedicated to a limited academic curriculum, focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with smaller class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some drawbacks. One major issue is the cost, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 a year for boarders. Each school tries to help families with scholarships and financial aid for exceptionally talented children. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

It is important to note that separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some children may lose their musical abilities during their teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide support when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic focus, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before pursuing a specialist education. Children who are also academically gifted may thrive in a regular school with a strong music program or by combining a standard school routine with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, along with orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the plants I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to create detailed studies of individual plants instead of painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants together, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes, it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and it's a hectic time,"" she says. However, she finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, and after a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in florists. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden features many plants from distant lands, but they thrive just as well as they did in their original homes, like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never finished, as Sarah Sutherland-Pilch explains to Veronica Lee. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. Known as Pilch, she works for a company in Val d'Isère, France, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University, where she studied French and History of Art. She sees being a chalet girl not as a career but as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can accommodate up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she considers the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep, as she believes it would be a mistake. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen and loads the dishwasher. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she notes. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful. Breakfast this morning was great fun, but some weeks don’t go as well for various reasons.""

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. ""We often start at Bananas, then might go to G Jay's and finish at Dick's T-Bar,"" she explains. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day when you really don’t want to be cooking breakfast while feeling exhausted,"" she admits.

On Sundays, work starts earlier than usual, as breakfast for the guests must be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We just blitz the place—clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready."" If she hasn’t done the shopping for the week on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests, who usually arrive around 4:30 p.m. ""Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions. I think the mountain air affects them,"" she says.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps any guests who need boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop and getting a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie, a zookeeper, spent a day at the offices of Marie Claire magazine. ""Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a still-life photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm and peaceful place, and here I was rushing around when I could have been quietly cuddling an animal. Some members of the fashion team seemed quite stressed, but my job is not very pressuring. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I found it funny to think that I would usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I am interested in how magazines operate, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I was petting one of the elephants, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes in a cupboard. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had such a wonderful day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening program Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I enjoyed being outside because, depending on my shifts, I sometimes don’t see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was a lot of fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the rest of the team. My romantic idea of landscape gardening didn’t include hard physical work or careful planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective as a gardener, so I don’t plan to quit my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medication. I thought I might faint while doing some tasks, but I surprised myself by managing well. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is not as meaningful as nursing. My day at the hospital was not exactly pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as a cabin crew member. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt completely different—people started to look up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked to us about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I already knew from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Memories**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as possible. There is a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past stunning seascapes. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the most beautiful gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking views.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with an aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On that train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey itself was wonderful, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unpredictable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train finally arrived, it was a rush of people climbing into and onto the carriages, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains when they are children, but that’s not my story. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, well-maintained section of the line cared for by volunteers. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Are you trying to get your story published? If you’re unsure where to send it, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" One important thing to understand is that you need to research your target markets and learn about publishers while also improving your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world. 

No matter what type of writing you do, it’s essential to know the markets you want to reach. One of the best ways to do this is by reading as much relevant material as you can. Visit your local library and explore nearby bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

Keep in mind that this knowledge needs to be updated regularly since new publications are always coming out, editors change jobs, and magazines can shift their focus. Publishers are always looking for fresh talent, so as writers, we must provide what they want. 

If you’re unsure about what to write, for example, if you think you might want to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories, as this market is quite limited today. Get recent copies of those magazines and learn about the types of stories they are buying and who their readers are. These readers have specific expectations, and the editor’s job is to meet those needs.

Writers often ask me, ""This has been rejected three times—am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone, but it’s likely that the work isn’t ready for publication. I try to give honest feedback while remaining positive. The issue is that many new writers are too eager to submit their work before they are truly ready. If you’ve only written one story or article, it’s very unlikely to get published. This is rare. 

When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have years of experience in publishing or journalism behind them. Once you send out your work for the first time, start writing more while you wait for a response—write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will improve your skills, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your confidence and fluency. Instead of discarding any of your work, focus on improving it. 

I also recommend not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before achieving success. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby, or consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,"On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The usual clean and bright atmosphere of the station felt lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students scattered their bags on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me, who had long blond hair. I had thought about talking to her myself. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

""Well, northbound, yes,"" she replied. ""But to Philadelphia?"" 

""No, New York, but I'll be..."" 

""Thanks, anyway,"" he said, moving to the next bench. Now I was paying full attention. He asked an old lady, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said, ""Wilmington,"" he just walked on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform as if I was focused on the train. I was going to Philadelphia. I understood why he didn’t ask me; he probably thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He seemed stressed now. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five—older than me. A schoolteacher type. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them like pets on leashes. 

Then I heard the man talking. ""My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn’t know what to do."" The woman listened sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet to see where this was going. 

""So I told her to stay put in the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" I thought this was a strange story. Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? 

""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" I thought this was a weak excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a simple envelope, but a padded one, the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. I thought silently, ""Watch yourself, lady."""
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, shares his thoughts about his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef. John believes that everyone has a chance in life. For him, that chance was to run a restaurant, while Gary's was to pursue cooking. When John learned about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it, even though it was in poor condition. He felt it was just right for his plans.

Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembered feeling sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. This made him value family time. His wife took care of their children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made it a point to have meals together, which helped their children, Gary and Joe, grow up confident. From a young age, they would interact with regular customers, giving them a strong start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath, thinking it was a swimming pool, and accidentally knocked himself out. As he grew older, he earned pocket money by doing small jobs. By the age of ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he always had money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before John. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John enjoyed seeing Gary contribute.

Although Gary was not very academic, he excelled in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John realized that Gary had a talent for catering. When Gary needed to do work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one goal at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told Gary that he needed to achieve his goals by the age of 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary attended catering college. On his first day, while other students struggled, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his tasks in just an hour. He even helped his classmates. John is amazed by how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become and feels very proud of him. He has always encouraged Gary to work hard for what he wants because nothing is given for free. Gary has recognized the opportunities he has and has taken full advantage of them.

As parents, we hope our children listen to us. John feels satisfied knowing that even if Gary only remembers a small part of their conversations, he has learned valuable lessons."
FCE_7,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was very difficult, like searching for gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections. If you knew someone who knew someone else who was moving out, that often helped. But for Jo, who had just arrived in Dublin, she had no such connections. She didn’t know anyone who could tell her about a vacant room. Instead, she had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. To Jo, Dublin felt like a big unknown. She felt nervous as she took the train to start her new job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school just assumed she would leave. Who would want to stay in a small, remote town? That’s all she had heard for years. Her friends wanted to escape, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates had moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be great if she stayed in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm, as they were often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. However, Jo was unaware that they were still talking about her while she responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her workplace and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive. There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary—just a red-brick terraced house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. 

""Desperate place,"" the girl said to Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt."" 

""Oh,"" Jo replied, continuing up the stairs. 

""Hello,"" said the girl wearing a T-shirt with ""Nessa"" on it. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, looked like a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 

""I'm Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. 

Nessa mentioned they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs—one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" 

""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society warns that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of dolphin populations.

Dolphins are special to us. They are among the most intelligent animals, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with thoughts of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been boosted by television shows. First, there was Flipper, and now we have Darwin from Seaquest. But these cheerful images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished waters.

For example, the population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by laws and cared for in marine reserves, but this is not the case. The lack of protection for dolphins could lead to one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.

There are forty different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out at sea and are rarely seen, so we know little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once frequently seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in small numbers in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The injuries on the few remaining dolphins suggest they are under stress.

Understanding why dolphin numbers are declining is complicated. Overfishing is greatly reducing fish populations, which threatens both local fishing industries and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not have enough time to find food elsewhere. They are also at risk of getting caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall, showing signs that they were caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also accumulate harmful substances in their bodies from the sea. For example, pesticides can build up in their fat, and when female dolphins produce milk, it can contain high levels of these toxins, which can harm their young. There has been at least one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s contaminated milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. However, noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better underwater than in the air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to. 

Exercise improves your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It increases muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries and improves specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Additionally, exercise benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something that might catch your attention: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can improve your sleep. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If you’re still not convinced, just think about it—common sense tells us that exercise is good for us. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to overdo it; training too hard can lead to injuries. It’s wise to start slowly and consult your doctor if you’re unsure about what’s best for you.

Good posture is crucial for improving your body shape. Poor posture can make you look and feel less energetic and can lead to minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head upward. This can help you lift your chest for better breathing and make your body appear slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It improves flexibility and helps you move easily, which supports good posture and prevents injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. 

A good exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their comfortable homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, Amanda and Owen are some of the hardest to find. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to unexpected challenges. Newman mentioned that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their collaboration has produced some of the best wildlife films on television, including a well-received documentary about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time tracking the shy jackal.

This kind of travel is common for filmmakers, who have been exploring the world to capture exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we usually resolve them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and one reason they work well together is that they share a similar view of the animals. ""When we are on the move, we set up our tents each night. But this time, we are working from a more fixed camp. We leave at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so meal preparation can be stressful,"" Newman said. 

Their lifestyle can be tough, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman recalled a time when they were filming a family of lions. One lioness would often wander off, but when she returned, she would greet all the pride members, including their vehicle.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" Newman said, ""because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create films that are rich in atmosphere, capturing the true spirit of the place and its animals, and that resonate emotionally with viewers. I believe evoking an emotional response is more powerful than just appealing to logic."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. When I spoke with her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket parking lot. I was surprised by her choice of training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slowing down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra explained, ""My entire life right now is about being at my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to achieve maximum fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they have a lot of talent."" Currently, the England team is ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no break between games like in a series. In a series, you can still win even if you lose the first game. But in the Championships, you only have one chance, and you must be ready to take advantage of it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become more difficult and faster. Players are now more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose."" But once the game is over, players become friends. 

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It is crucial that we all think and train like world-class players."" As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""

Kendra has carefully planned her netball career from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she is likely to feel emotional, knowing her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of her time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which involves studying the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, Rachel explains, ""The space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

If there is an emergency and she needs to get to the surface quickly, Rachel can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. Although no one has tested it yet, she believes it would not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel recalls her first dive, which was on a ship. She entered the vehicle with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a confined space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands. There, they explored a large area of underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on 'black smokers,' another term for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest parts of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before."" After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to become a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believes being on time is very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher commented, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, explains that candidates who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. While many believe that what is inside matters most, it is essential to present yourself well in an interview.

Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our words and facial expressions send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also crucial not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview, leading to an immediate job offer. She was very excited but showed too much enthusiasm. Once her boss sensed her excitement, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what you say and how you say it can greatly affect your interview success. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can provide insights into the company's activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can create a positive impression and show your interest in the company. Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions prepared and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She states, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators use short sentences and highlight key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the business, the City became less exciting and more tiring. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, not much has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right choice. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business from her flat in London. She says, ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were awful. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even longer hours, so I left. Many people thought I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. In the fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier and less stressed now, but I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He shares, ""I was in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I didn’t find the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I chose to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and spoke to their owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, which is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Athletes Share Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many different ones, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn’t get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to gain some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s enjoyable there, with excellent facilities and a lively nightlife. However, I need to be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to qualify for the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn. To succeed, I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, the effort is worth it; my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. The sacrifices pay off in the long run, as winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I guess I’ve become a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Being on a boat with my teammates is always fun. We have a traditional way of celebrating our wins, and while some say we act a bit childish, we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to return home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. It’s important to have a balance; you can’t be focused on sailing all the time. I’m recognized in the sailing world, but I prefer to keep a low profile. I receive many letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It’s always exciting to walk onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. However, at my last tournament, things got a bit overwhelming with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its challenges. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I received too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that contributed to our breakup. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. I’m focused on my game now and plan to enjoy other aspects of life after I retire, which comes relatively early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it's the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty when she gives in to their requests because she worries about buying unhealthy food. However, she also feels bad for constantly saying no, which makes her anxious before they even leave the house. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she feels guilty for not letting them learn to make their own choices. It seems like a no-win situation.

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes while shopping. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are a key place where this advertising is effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain items, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when faced with appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance states that most parents care about their children's diet and have ideas about healthy food, although these ideas may not always be correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, especially since children often only hear about products from advertisements, which gives them a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, as Dibb notes, the main goal of advertising is still to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they must decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she feels uneasy about how she handles their requests. She has talked to her son about advertisements so much that he now thinks they are not trustworthy. As a result, they have less conflict in the supermarket because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, explains that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, yet they buy rich foods for themselves. He acknowledges that it is natural for children to want to enjoy nice things too, but he still feels annoyed by their requests. His willingness to say yes often depends on his mood and how well things are going in his life.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any lost sales."
FCE_20,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin has been created after extensive research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This approach has allowed the hotel to incorporate the latest technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to keep track of their preferences. This system helps the hotel provide a special experience for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common complaint among hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will particularly appreciate the technology in their rooms. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. To meet their needs, the hotel has transformed the traditional business center into individual rooms equipped with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities.

Given the rapid pace of technological change, the hotel has prepared for future upgrades by installing extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy replacement with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated as needed. Despite all this advanced technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are both cozy and inviting.

The Merrion also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden. As with all luxury hotels, the food must be exceptional. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who already had two Michelin stars for his Dublin restaurant, has moved his business to the Merrion. This move has allowed him to design a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant on-site is a great advantage with minimal financial risk. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:**  
""I get my energy from excitement. I need challenges and love learning new things. Activities with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, energize me too. Dance is expressive and uplifting. When I'm bored, I feel drained and life seems pointless. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. Work feels rewarding, not like a chore. Enjoying what I do helps me feel good, even when I'm tired. I need enough sleep to feel my best. Exercise boosts my energy, but finding the motivation to do it can be hard. I attend a yoga class weekly and try to work out at home. After exercising, my mood improves. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't rely on healthy eating for energy; I think it's about having natural enthusiasm and a positive attitude. I dislike negativity. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the past two years have been exciting. Being around lively young people energizes me. I enjoy taking photos, even if I'm not great at it, and I like writing lyrics for fun. It helps me relax while traveling.""

**D. Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and being positive about life. Working with kids is energizing; they are resilient and full of life. Energy is like a natural chemical that comes from connecting with others—just smile at someone and see how it feels when they smile back. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:**  
""I love transforming wasteland into a garden. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also motivates me. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if caught, I playfully say I didn't know it was private. It feels childlike and fun.""

**F. Katherine Monblot, Therapist:**  
""I believe it's important to have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I dislike drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found their demands exhausting. You have limited energy, so focus it on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron skates appeared in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the upper classes in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating very popular.

Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed will improve as you get better. Your body position is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is essential in skating, more than in many other sports.

To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outward. Push off with your back foot while making a small movement with the other foot. This is quite simple! If you practice this for a while, you can gradually make longer movements as you gain confidence. Learning how to fall safely is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall without getting hurt, stay relaxed to reduce the impact with the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel and then stand up.

Once you feel comfortable on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle.

If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed and fluid their movements are. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise program. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent fitness routine for overall health."
FCE_64,"**Trills and Bills**

Seeing a talented child receive a medal can bring tears of joy. Julia Gregson spoke with three young achievers and their mothers about the joys and challenges they face.

A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She hopes to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Training is very demanding right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off, or your body gets stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother**: ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen parents try to push their kids, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level requires a lot of time and energy, and she has to want it herself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has friends from around the world and the confidence that comes with success.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at age ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents enjoy show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement and fun of show-jumping. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I’m determined. I’m happy they celebrate my wins, but I’m not doing it for them. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team, and my big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's mother**: ""From the moment Sarah first sat on a horse at age one, it was clear she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is very organized and feels completely at home on a horse. Watching your child succeed in something they love is an incredible feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should; I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant, and I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's mother**: ""Jane played her first game at age five. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. I’m proud when she wins, but if she decided to quit tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to discourage her because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are starting to reach our true potential, similar to the Cro-Magnons who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health and growth. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be a blessing, turned out to be a health problem, according to some experts. Despite this, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland could support many more people than hunting and gathering could.

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to resemble those of our ancestors again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing companies are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? Some experts, like Robert Fogel from the University, believe we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. 

However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even with good nutrition. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be part of an audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this topic. Studio audiences, like technical problems, are a common part of television, but many people find them mysterious. When we see audiences cheering on game shows, we often wonder who these people are. 

Among all types of live entertainment, studio audiences are often seen as the least important. Some people in the television industry even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were just made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience; they come from various backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different audiences for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home wonder why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and endure hours of discomfort just to see something they could watch at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on television. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason people attend is out of curiosity to see how a show is made. However, the most common reason I heard was simply, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it’s like. We imagine sitting close together with strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and we respond accordingly. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We believe a good show shouldn’t need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed the feeling of being part of live television. She mentioned seeing her favorite comedian live, saying that watching him on TV at home misses a lot of the experience. I found that from my seat, I could only see the back of someone’s head, and I ended up watching the show on a monitor.

Although going to a studio might not be the best way to watch television, that’s not what matters most. For many in the audience, it was simply a fun and free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,"**Favorite Places**

**Bruce**  
I prefer landscapes that have some human presence. When I travel, I am drawn to charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. At the age of eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham, located in a beautiful valley. Cycling was a way for me to escape school. I enjoyed exploring the rugged hilltops, sheltered valleys, and historic villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit it today. I used to write about my adventures in a private diary, which was my first attempt at travel writing, a field in which I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by enthusiasts. I always choose first class because it costs only a little more than the regular ticket. The scenery isn’t breathtaking; the train travels across Romney Marsh with its sheep and alongside a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to—when the train takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers get a glimpse into people’s lives as they make tea, wash dishes, or set up deckchairs. I see myself reflected in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage looking into their homes. It’s the simplicity of the landscape that captivates me—just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me pay closer attention and look for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coastal area. The beaches are hard to access and filled with rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to admire the power of the sea. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a vast moorland perfect for hiking. There are few residents and visitors, making it a quiet and remote area, which I enjoy. I discovered this place by chance when I was a student, and I have returned every year since, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed very little since my first visit. Having a child makes these trips even more special, and it saddens me that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I moved to Devon, in the west of England, for school. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream home—a magical, secluded, and romantic house. Here, you can only hear the sea, the wind, and the birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals of all kinds. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She excitedly asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I agreed, but only for one night. We prepared a special tank for the snake, just for a short visit, so we could admire it and look it up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their room. The chaos involved our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca, which I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around the room with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the flailing arms of my children.

In the midst of the confusion, I tripped and fell. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat continued to jump around in a noisy frenzy. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. 

I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, this same mouse was caught by Domino three more times during its life but eventually died of old age. 

Feeling encouraged by my success with the cat, I examined the snake but found no weak points. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, trying to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked wary. I carefully slid my hands under the snake and stood up, then walked to the end of the garden. I pointed the snake towards a tree, hoping it would find a new home.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to attack, it instead wrapped itself around my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter. We stood there in the fading light, with my four children, myself, and the snake. My eldest son, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""

I asked the children to gather at the snake's tail and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly, it began to slide away. Without looking back, it climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"**Drop Me a Line!**

In our fast-paced world filled with phones, fax machines, and computers, the traditional practice of writing letters is in danger of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter offers a unique joy that no other form of communication can provide. There is the thrill of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who sent it, and the enjoyment of reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy; what mattered was that they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. Occasionally, my father would write long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters from home shared everyday news about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but the letters are what I remember most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. During my youth, I often attracted people who had to work or study far away, and we kept in touch through letters. Surprisingly, writing letters seemed to strengthen our relationships. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than in conversation.

I cherish the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. While short notes are nice, receiving a full year’s worth of news is even better! I especially love getting airmail envelopes with beautiful stamps. I have friends who write to me from different countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. There’s also a woman from France who I met by chance in a restaurant while on holiday. If I hadn’t asked for her address, we would never have started writing to each other. Thankfully, she replied, and now we have a regular correspondence. This helps me improve my French since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited each other’s homes twice.

My greatest letter-writing achievement happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our correspondence lasted so long, and the local newspaper even featured our story on the front page.

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did for my mother. She and my son also have penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend.

I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not survive for future generations. The mountain, which was once a place for prayer and worship, has drawings that are around 4,000 years old. These include images of cows with horns, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being harmed by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, explains that people assume the pictures will always be there because they have existed for so long. He warns that if the damage continues at this pace, there will be nothing left in 50 years. He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and blurs the artwork. Some visitors even break off pieces to take home as souvenirs. Clottes notes that when people cannot take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer. The weather naturally polishes the drawings, but if the sun is shining and visitors cannot see them well, they often rub and scrape them to make them look newer.

Other researchers have observed that some people arrive with long sticks that have sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the entire mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing public access only through guided tours. He argues that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be affected.

Clottes disagrees with de Lumley's strict proposal, saying it is the most effective but will likely lead to protests from local residents. He emphasizes that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture years ago, and we must do everything possible to protect it. David Lavergne, the regional architect, also prefers not to close the site. He believes that while de Lumley's idea is not ideal, it is challenging to prevent visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. He suggests that charging a fee might be necessary since there is not enough money to hire enough guards.

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to access—tourists can now avoid a three-and-a-half-hour walk by using vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to cordon off the area and provide guides. She insists that the plan should not be abandoned due to a lack of funds, stating that money must be allocated because the Ministry of Culture has recognized this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing these drawings for future generations."
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it's the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty when she gives in to their requests because she worries about buying unhealthy food. However, she also feels bad for constantly saying no, which makes her anxious before they even leave the house. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she feels guilty for not letting them learn to make their own choices. It seems like a no-win situation.

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are a key place where this advertising is effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain items, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when faced with appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance states that most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, although these ideas may not always be correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, especially since children often only hear about products from advertisements, which gives them a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, as Dibb notes, the main goal of advertising is to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels uneasy about how she handles their requests. She has talked to her son about advertisements so much that he now thinks they are not trustworthy. As a result, they have less conflict in the supermarket because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, admits that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, while they themselves buy rich foods like double cream and chocolate. He finds it enjoyable to buy nice things and understands why children want to share in that. However, he also feels annoyed by their demands, which can change based on his mood. If he is feeling good, he is more likely to say yes, making it hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

In the past, climbers would go to mountains to climb. Now, you can find challenging climbing experiences both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches in excitement as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is better known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both events share one important feature: The Wall. The ability to hold such events is thanks to new and rapidly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became essential for top climbers to stay fit. Since they couldn't use cliffs for much of the year, they started using brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them strengthen their fingers and avoid boredom from not climbing.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls specifically for training, using bricks with special edges for grip. One of the pioneers was Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He came up with the idea of embedding natural rock in concrete blocks to create climbing walls. Throughout the 1970s, many similar walls were built in sports halls across the country, but they had clear design issues. These walls could only be vertical, while outdoor cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Additionally, once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any existing wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to experiment with panels on steel frames. Unlike concrete, which was too heavy for creating overhanging walls without extensive construction, steel frames could be set up anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**

If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will likely mention how risky it is. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are many more actors than there are roles available. When you decide to pursue acting, some people you thought were close friends may think you are making a mistake, while others might support you. Everyone will have different opinions, but this is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own path and dreams.

There are no easy shortcuts to becoming an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee of success in the industry. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors and fresh talent, along with the excitement and potential rewards that come with the profession.

Many people ask what talent really is. I believe talent is a combination of natural ability and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves courage and confidence in what you are doing and how you present it. 

The desire to act can be hard to explain. In theater, the key moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform, no matter where they are acting. 

When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often don’t have a clear answer. They understand their own skills and techniques, but they know that their success can change quickly. Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. One month you might be unemployed, doing other jobs, and the next month you could be auditioning for a role. Even if you really want the job, you might not get it. 

Because of this uncertainty, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. No one enjoys being rejected, and this possibility is always present from the moment you start auditioning professionally. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the role. Ultimately, it is up to you; if you don’t care enough about your career, others may not care about you either."

FCE_28,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are starting to reach our true potential, similar to the Cro-Magnons who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health and growth. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be a blessing, turned out to be a health problem, according to some experts. Despite this, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland could support many more people than hunting could.

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to resemble those of our ancestors again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing companies are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? Some experts, like Robert Fogel from the University, believe we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. 

However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even with good nutrition. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the business, the City became less exciting and more tiring. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, not much has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right choice. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business from her flat in London. She says, ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were long. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Many people thought I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. In the fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier and less stressed now, but I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He shares, ""I was in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I didn’t find the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I chose to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and spoke to their owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, which is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**A Winning Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, enjoying their past. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, an ancient game they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played together, and as Dave says, ""we had the best time ever."" 

When the family moved to New Mexico, they kept playing with their grandfather's pichenotte board, made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed how worn the board had become and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative wanted one, then a friend asked for another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People watched and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon, they couldn't get up from the table!"" Dave recalls.

When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched and found that it likely started in India with a similar game called 'carroms.' This game evolved into 'squails,' played in British pubs, and was brought to Canada by British immigrants. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. The game can be played by two to four people and requires skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' that they flick across a wheel-like board using their fingers. Scoring 20 points is achieved by getting a puck into a small hole, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. A game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity increased. Soon, championships were held, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, leading the brothers to start a full-time pichenotte business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have produced over 450 boards. Made from birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable and can handle a lot of use."" They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage, but the brothers believe that one day their garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first arrive at the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was an empty, overgrown piece of land. For a long time, it was seen as useless. However, through careful planning and hard work by one man, with strong support from his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful site you see today. 

During the construction of the village, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat ground into a sculpted landscape. While bulldozers and digging machines helped, a lot of manual labor was also involved. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. 

In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants were carefully chosen to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand. 

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who created over 100 models over nine years after the village opened in 1972. The models are made from various materials, including stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics, to endure different weather conditions. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last over time, but he quickly became knowledgeable himself. 

You will notice that a consistent scale has been maintained, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details of the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and upkeep. The methods used to create these realistic models have been adopted in other model villages across England and have even been included in college courses on modeling. 

All the buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific location. One of the most impressive structures is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini-golf course, which is the latest addition.

We kindly ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can lead to hours of repair work for us. You are welcome to take photos from the pathways only, and dogs are allowed on a short lead.

To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these buttons will make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we would appreciate any feedback you may have. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more diverse and interesting display. We also want to know if there are any models that you think do not meet the high standards of the village. We are constantly updating and replacing models, and your input is valuable.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"
FCE_69,"British tabloid newspapers often publish pictures that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of practice. While some pop stars do pose for photographers, this is not the norm. More often, individuals in the public eye suffer when their private moments are displayed on the front page. Despite this, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to address such problems. Rarely are these images in the public interest. For example, how do intimate photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos, and since she was in a hotel—a place where people expect privacy—she had a valid reason to complain, but she chose not to take action. It is scandalous that the PCC did not investigate this matter. 

The PCC should also look into a recent scandal involving a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead in addressing these shameful invasions? This seems like a good idea, as it could result in many decisions against newspapers. Such decisions would be reported by rival newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would likely not support these tabloids, forcing editors to stop publishing such material. Photographers would also be affected, as they might no longer be able to afford to hide behind trees to take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities.

If the PCC took on the role of a ""police officer,"" it would face several challenges. How would it decide whether to investigate? Should it encourage victims to file complaints? If victims refuse to act, should the PCC still proceed? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect the PCC to take action on their behalf and could be upset if it does not. The PCC's role would be too vast; it would be difficult to monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines. 

There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is violated, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Many might prefer to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet, such as fearing that a worse story could come to light if they complain. In this way, the PCC could become seen as an enemy.

A British comedian faced similar issues when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable; many believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. Finding a simple solution to this serious problem is difficult."

Confident people often seem like they were born that way, but many say it is a skill they learned over time. Nina Hathway interviews five individuals to find out how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At around twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was nervous but ended up doing well, and someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I felt very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was a turning point that helped me in many areas of my life.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became overly aggressive and impatient, thinking that was how confident people acted. Eventually, I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work becomes too overwhelming, I don’t feel guilty about postponing some tasks. When facing challenges, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can undermine confidence, so I often have quiet conversations with myself to overcome those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as very confident, but the calmer I appear, the more nervous I actually feel. I had to learn to look confident because it is crucial in television. Interviewing people made me realize that most of us feel tense in important situations, but we feel better when talking to someone friendly. My mother once told me, during my teenage worries about fashion, that everyone is too busy thinking about themselves to notice me. I find this advice very helpful. I also believe that facing your fears helps build confidence. I was very nervous during my driving test, but after passing, I felt I could handle anything.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am well-liked in the restaurant, but I know that not everyone will like me. I focus on liking myself for who I am, rather than trying to meet others' expectations. My company offers many training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. They also encourage us to set realistic goals, which helps us see our progress instead of aiming too high and feeling disappointed.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings, afraid to share my opinions. Eventually, I found the courage to speak up. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public before and would shake with nerves. I told myself, 'Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.' I also found it helpful to write down a few notes to refer to, like a comfort blanket. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking publicly. The real secret to confidence is reminding yourself repeatedly that 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finders can keep it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a line of tense competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites shot into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different kite designs, which were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 

""Flying kites isn't too hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how to do it."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept. At his house, I enjoyed cold milky tea and fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he asked me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't fit it into my plans. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A narrow boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before starting my hike, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was steep and slippery. However, when I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and thousands of creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. As I slid downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being washed away (which sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there at the bottom of the track, covered in mud. 

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I will remember it more for the kindness of its people."

A. Melanie, 22, dancer: ""I'm a shopping addict! I love spending money. When I have cash, I go shopping and it makes me happy. I can't resist sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're both addicted!""

B. Brenda, 40, office manager: ""I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the grocery shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don’t spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my son and daughter shopping, but we all have different tastes, so it’s not enjoyable. I rarely spend money on myself, and when I do, I feel guilty and tell my husband I spent less than I actually did because the real price seems shocking.""

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager: ""I only shop for essentials. I dislike shopping and only go when I have to. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and won’t settle for anything else. Shopping is tiring, and I’d rather be doing something else.""

D. Anita, 35, TV producer: ""I like to browse occasionally, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and prefer to shop quickly. However, I do have some items in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m a careful shopper who sometimes makes mistakes.""

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary: ""I really dislike shopping. I can never find what I want or get help. The shops are noisy and messy, which makes it a nightmare for me. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often since I receive most of my clothes as gifts. For food, I go to the supermarket once a week and get it done quickly.""

F. Lisa, 22, actress: ""I’m probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my friends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I’ll buy it.""

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant: ""I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t go overboard. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often regret spending too much.""

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker: ""I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too crowded. I consider myself a careful shopper. I have a good idea of what I want and don’t rush into buying things. I check other shops to find better deals, which takes me a long time.""

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager: ""I’m an unwilling shopper. Working in the city center has made shopping less appealing to me. When I have to shop, I go without trying things on because it’s too much effort. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I prefer to make a few mistakes rather than spend too much time in shops."""

**Easter Quiz for Children**  
During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about surprises. Free quiz sheets are available at the desk by the Orange Street entrance. Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer various questions about them. The quiz sheets can be picked up from 25 March to 9 April during normal gallery hours.

**New Artwork**  
The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch painter Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for specific flowers to bloom in different seasons. This artwork was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is currently displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition titled ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this time: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until 31 May.

**Lecture Series**  
The series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will talk about Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will focus on Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often tell stories through their paintings.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery is pleased to announce that the restaurant has improved and expanded its services. With new kitchens, the restaurant now offers a wide selection of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Visitor Information**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery are available every day at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (except Sundays). These tours highlight some of the Gallery's most famous paintings and showcase its collection of important European art from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where kids can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it even better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to enjoy the food we've made together."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She shares, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of just staying home on weekends. At first, I wasn't very interested, but I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, explains, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they grow up."""

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometre. The main difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of money, known as 'currencies', to make trading easier. Eventually, these different currencies began to connect, which is why today we all use a national currency."
PET_46,"**Write a Winning Story!**

You have a chance to win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other winners will receive £100 each. We are looking for people who can write great stories. The judges include novelist Mary Littlejohn, television reporter Michael Brown, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, many stories focused on love, family, and friendship problems. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so that readers want to keep reading.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your descriptions and information are accurate. If you’re unsure about something, it’s better not to include it.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an engaging way and end it with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your plot carefully and think of something unexpected for the conclusion.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using descriptive language. Help the reader connect with them.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a new rule. Your story must not have been published in any form, including on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. 

There is a £5 fee that will go to the Writers' Association. Please make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it along with the application form and your story to us. The closing date is July 30, and we will notify the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have any of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical texts. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created several scientific tools to assist her work. During her time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. They are the only flowering plants that can survive in the extremely cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way.

One of the remarkable features of grass is its ability to recover quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike many other plants, grass grows new leaves from below the soil rather than from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live together in one area. When they eat all the grass in a spot, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh food source."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion and recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream of making fashion her career. She believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.

After finishing her degree, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. Although she attended many industry events, she couldn't afford the designer clothes she admired. To solve this, she began making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends noticed her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. This led her to find a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. The clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned, which motivated her to leave her advertising job. She took out a £20,000 loan to start her own womenswear brand.

Kal's parents were supportive of her decision to change careers, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she recently gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels grateful for her success, saying, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses the entire Australian continent, moving from the warm northern coast through vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but this name is somewhat misleading because the train is known for being late.

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide began in the 1920s, with a line reaching Alice Springs. However, flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just a few months before my trip. The railway was designed for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. Unlike luxury trains like the Orient Express, the Ghan does not focus on providing luxury, although the food on board is very good. The railway was originally built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to Australia’s southern cities via Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent.

It is rare for a transcontinental railway to be completed, and the Ghan claims to be the first north-south railway in the world. As I waited to board, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Many of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners who were especially eager to get on the train. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip up the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged anymore, and few people do it. Our group simply walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers choose to stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very exciting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. However, on the third day at dawn, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was coming to an end, and although the train did not meet all the expectations set by advertisements, it had taken me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time. 

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high, making it probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries,' which are large bowl-like areas cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are essential on Ben Nevis because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. 

Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, there was still a sense of nervousness when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always challenging. 

As we climbed, my legs felt heavy. Being the least experienced climber, I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes paused to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start climbing again. I promised myself that I would train properly before my next climb. 

After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. This path is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops steeply on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. Unfortunately, we were not so lucky, as a mist had rolled in. 

Getting back down to camp can be just as difficult as climbing up. You need to be able to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. It was only when I was safely in the tent that I could say I truly enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, similar to our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The construction took several months, and we watched it all happen. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant some beautiful open space was lost. The noise from the construction machines was quite loud, and the builders often had to stop working because of heavy rain. At times, we worried that the building would never be completed.

Now, we have five large classrooms, much bigger than those in our old school, which was very old. We also share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a lovely dining room, and spacious changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the students, teachers, and the computers we use. The building is designed to keep the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof, as it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for our lights and computers comes from a wind turbine located on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very quickly. It is so large that it can be seen from far away! We took some pictures that we plan to share on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers believe we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

PET_2,"A month ago, I never imagined that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not great, but it had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn were with Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area well. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we were unsure of the exact activities. Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I started with caving. Climbing out was more difficult than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally made it out—covered in mud but happy and excited about our adventure."
PET_23,"**Letter to the Newport Evening News**

On Saturday afternoon, I accidentally left my handbag on the bus. Inside were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized my mistake, it was too late to do anything. I felt worried because I am 72 years old and far from home. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what had happened, and he kindly gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he told me I could keep the fare. I made it home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that operated the bus where I left my handbag. He informed me that they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me.

I was amazed to get my handbag back with everything inside still there. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me that day. Their kindness and honesty meant a lot to me.

PET_60,"**Sharks**

Sharks are among the most intimidating animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they prey on. 

While sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are quite different. For instance, most sharks must keep swimming constantly to breathe and survive, which means they hardly ever sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can become completely still. This is a useful method for researchers who need to study sharks, as it helps them learn more about these intriguing creatures."

PET_53,"Joining the Kirov Ballet

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov Ballet School in St. Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone surrounded me, asking questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and they switched to English, so we were able to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I can understand my teachers.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mother stayed with me, and I felt a bit sad when she left. I even called home late one night because I was feeling lonely. The classes in Russia are much harder than those in my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence to meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was extremely cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the locals said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

Currently, we are preparing for a new production, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very lucky to be here."
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to experience the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, it was decided that the dark and cold winter could be seen as a positive feature. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a structure made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous worldwide.

As winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to construct the hotel for that year. As each section is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first section is completed in December, and each week after that, a new section opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date depends on the weather, so plans can change.

In spring, as temperatures rise, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature stays between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing, such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves, as part of their stay. It is also wise for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose shoes that are slightly larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items along with your booking, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture store, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store because of many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (available only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (available only from 3 am to 8 am). The store's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours without closing. Unfortunately, it had to shut down just half an hour after opening.

A police officer who was called to the scene said, ""We knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly for their turn. Another issue was that there was a long line of cars trying to enter the parking lot. I was shocked to see many people leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few meters to the store, which completely blocked the road.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who managed to enter the store, said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were very calm and explained the situation. They had no choice; it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had previously dived deeper, she used a balloon to help her come back up then. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the first woman to break a world record previously held by a man.

A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. After several serious accidents involving other divers, some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous. However, Tanya disagrees, emphasizing that safety and training are the most important aspects of the sport.

Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya maintains a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done in the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking to build her stamina.

When preparing for dives, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive to avoid fatigue, which could affect her performance.

When not training, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects and films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. Tanya feels that her life now reflects her childhood dreams. Because she is well-known in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she discusses environmental issues.

Looking to the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and is eager to emphasize that she does not plan to retire from the sport anytime soon."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few restrictions. If you can draw something, you can animate it for the cinema. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting for people of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry believed that cartoons were only for children. However, soon after, a few directors introduced original ideas. They showed that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Not every cartoon film was a success, though. For instance, *The Black Cauldron* did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this experience, and film companies started to earn a lot of money again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson shares her experience with her first TV role. 

""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to adapt the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to audition for the role. My mother was surprised at first, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. 

Filming started a week after the term began, so I asked the university for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends about the filming, but they found out and thought it was exciting. It was an incredible experience, and I feel very lucky. After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. Although I’m not from an acting family, my grandfather was an opera singer. I have auditioned for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I felt a bit lost. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I’m going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is shared in this book. I believe our company has valuable insights on how to run a successful business while staying true to our beliefs. 

This is not a typical business book, nor is it solely about my life. The key message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can make a positive impact. In both business and life, I want to feel joy, a sense of family, and excitement from unexpected events. I have always wanted my employees at 'The Body Shop' to share these feelings.

Now, this book spreads my ideas to the world and makes them public. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' or to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."
PET_4,"**A Journey Along the Beautiful Douro River**

PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid created by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. To make just half a kilo of honey, bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers. The color and taste of honey vary depending on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder flavor compared to darker honey.

In ancient times, honey was the main source of sweetness because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and enhance athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used to soothe sore throats and is included in many skin and hair care products."
PET_7,"**Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of England's largest towns. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a significant center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be recognized as a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second largest city in England. For the next 300 years, it continued to grow and prosper, becoming known for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. The city has a growing student population and is a modern commercial center, being the largest hub for insurance services outside London.

Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and several arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, residents dealt with a large construction site in the city center as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with beautiful water features and many trees. Fortunately, the old open market remains in the city center, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich successfully combines its rich history with modern growth."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown significantly. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to participate at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots communicate with each other via radio and light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This event is called ""balloon glows,"" and it offers a great chance for taking beautiful photographs. To see these glows, you should arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 AM, as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, with some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, as well as popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will especially enjoy this.

In the afternoon, you can experience a balloon flight over the desert by booking a ride with one of the many companies that offer this service. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a stunning view of the festival from above. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for ballooning. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival entrance. Dress in several layers of light clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but you will need sunglasses and sunscreen during the day. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this former industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, demonstrating the important relationship between people and plants. It is fascinating to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters maintain the right temperature for the plants. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid due to a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environments of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone in the near future."
PET_11,"Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I don't understand why. After all, 500 pages of original writing for just £6.99 is quite impressive, isn't it? The majority of the book consists of fiction, including both parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable works by well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have focused on food in their pieces. For example, Jane Harris's story, Those Nails, is not something you should read right after eating, as it contains some very disturbing scenes! 

The collection also features excellent contributions from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Additionally, there are excerpts from novels that are still being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a small section of non-fiction, which includes a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers, and a remarkable personal piece by Ursula Owen. Overall, this is an outstanding collection, and I am eager to see what next year's edition will bring."
PET_14,"**No Title**

Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher, believes that the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. She explains that this is when children are discovering the world around them. Living in London, Margaret usually accepts students who are three or four years old, but she has made exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds.

When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class included her children’s five-year-old friends. Margaret teaches in groups, with about twelve students in each class. Each lesson lasts one hour and takes place every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her each week. It is also important for parents to attend these classes, as their involvement is crucial.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play music by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years, and there is often a noticeable difference between their playing and their ability to read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not designed to create expert violinists. She often advises students who excel to leave and pursue more traditional methods of violin study."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to their previous album, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott has joined as the new bass guitarist, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Additionally, Tom Simpson is now playing the drums.

From the first song, which is a dance track, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and more energetic. Most of the later songs return to the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks may surprise many fans, but either could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford showcases his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should appreciate that he recorded these songs before experiencing throat issues, which led to the cancellation of their upcoming tour. However, anyone who has bought tickets should not worry, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.

On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in different styles, from the familiar slow songs to lively tracks that make you want to dance. I did feel that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Nevertheless, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."

Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land instead of by sea. In 1849, thousands of people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest individuals were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill known as Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous attractions like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the former prison."

Pepys discusses important events of that time, such as diseases, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his own flaws—like often falling asleep in church or admiring pretty girls. He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they made up, as well as his concerns about her health. 

In addition to reading, Pepys enjoyed music, theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. He was a busy man with many important roles, including being a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not focus on shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people wrapped around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. It was only about one hundred and fifty years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. 

Originally, all shoes were handmade, but now most shoes are produced in large factories using machines, although some shoemakers still use traditional methods. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to create many more shoes at lower prices, making them available to a larger number of people."
PET_20,"When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to encourage more women to join the sport, to show them how enjoyable it can be, and to help them feel confident enough to start running. I decided to create a running club for women in my community because I was frustrated with how many race organizers think. They often complain about the low number of women in running but use this as a reason not to provide separate changing rooms.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they probably imagined it as painful training. They didn't realize that running could be fun, with chatting and smiling while enjoying beautiful places, like along a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about diet and fitness from other runners. I wanted to contribute to women's running, and it has been a joy to see their progress—almost as much joy as they have experienced themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns quickly developed, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this problem, a winter trail was built in 1910 for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothing to gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced dog teams and steam boats as the main transport. However, in 1925, the dogs had one last important mission when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The medicine needed to treat the disease was located in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. At that time, airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away on a trip. Therefore, it was decided to transport the medicine using dog teams.

The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail, and took twenty teams just six days to complete. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to navigate through the heavy snow, and Togo proved to be an excellent guide. The final part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, preventing the team from falling into icy water. Thanks to their efforts, the diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite the cold, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to experience one of Europe’s most unique hotels. In this hotel, everything is made of ice, including the rooms where guests eat, drink, and sleep. You can even have a wedding ceremony there. The bar is also made of ice, so it’s not a good idea to place hot drinks on it!

The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags that keep them warm in such cold conditions. If needed, the hotel can also provide suitable outdoor clothing. The Ice Hotel lasts for only six months because it melts in the summer, and every winter, it is rebuilt. Constructing the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on an all-boys football team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized she was very fast. 

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand at first because I only knew about football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to training. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help improve their financial situation. They agreed to let him take her away for training.

In 1991, Maria accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had previously refused because she was worried about missing her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother."
PET_57,"The Skywalk

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and especially to enjoy the stunning views. The view is even more impressive from the Skywalk. The Skywalk is 1,219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass, allowing visitors to see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of visitors have experienced it. To protect the glass, you must wear special covers over your shoes. Walking on the Skywalk gives you the feeling of floating like a bird high in the air."
PET_9,"**THE ROCKIES**

The Rocky Mountains stretch nearly the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest but are also found a few hundred miles from the center in the southern regions. Although the Rockies are not as tall as the Alps, they are still incredibly beautiful. There are many roads that cross the Rockies, but the best way to experience them is by train. 

You can start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful cities. This city is unique because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes away from the city center. 

In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains each week, but the journey remains an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you will see some of the most stunning views at night."
PET_42,"**ZOOS**

People have been keeping animals in zoos for over 3,000 years, starting with a large zoo in China called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals were often trained to perform for visitors, but this practice has stopped. Now, the main goal of zoos is to allow people to observe animals in their natural behaviors. Most cities today have a zoo or wildlife park.

However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters argue that zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, which would be difficult without them. On the other hand, critics believe it is wrong to confine animals in cages. They argue that poorly managed zoos can lead to animals living in unsanitary conditions and being fed inappropriate food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all experienced in competitions, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially considering our age. Musicians from each band even made up new songs right on stage. It was thrilling to watch, but even more exciting when my band performed!  

Our school has a fantastic jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often hang out after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps around the country; I’ve attended a few and learned a lot.  

Many adults are surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music while also feeling connected to its history, as you perform like the great jazz artists before you. Our school is fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without their help, we wouldn’t make much progress in our music!"
PET_54,"**Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is rare, and when it does occur, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Despite the recent dry winters, the local people welcome the rain when it arrives. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they benefit from a system of underground channels built in the 11th century that brings water from the mountains throughout the year. These mostly dry areas that receive water this way are called oases. 

Traveling south from Marrakesh, you reach Skoura, where every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter create a beautiful backdrop for this area."
PET_32,"**Gareth Ellis**

Gareth Ellis, who is 13 years old, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always dreamed of being a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. Kath explains, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three.""

When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time work in the circus. They both found jobs with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and return home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away.

Kath admits, ""I can't say it was easy. There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving behind our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""

Gareth shares, ""People ask about my education, but from the start, someone has always come to teach me wherever we go. I use the same books as my classmates back at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind.""

What about the future? Kath says, ""It was a tough decision, but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? He confidently states, ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day, maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency designed for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. These are sent to major national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles created by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and participate in projects, and we plan to open more centers nationwide. Since our agency began in 1994, originally called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined. One of them is Sophie. She shares, ""I first learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was impressed by the opportunities they had. Age didn’t matter; they were trusted to handle stories independently. I started attending the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and remained a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I ever expected. With the skills I gained, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, where I check articles written by journalists before they are published online.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen promotes skill-sharing among members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who teach new members basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often at youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these outings.

Eight-eighteen News offers training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, please call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test required to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here, you will find all the information you need before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. These flights take you over Antarctica and back. The exact dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the journey, we usually start to see sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctic research stations will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is also a camera next to the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit throughout the flight.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot will fly in long 'figure 8' patterns over interesting sights so that everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain will check the satellite images of the clouds and choose the route that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Absolutely! You are welcome to bring all types of cameras. We also offer some fun photo opportunities on board, where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothing."
PET_35,"**Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where kids can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it even better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to enjoy the food we've made together."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She shares, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of just staying home on weekends. At first, I wasn't very interested, but I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, explains, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Driving in winter can be dangerous because conditions can change quickly, leading to accidents. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill, and ice can be hidden under melting snow, making it easy to lose control. A car coming towards you might slide unexpectedly.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Think of driving as if you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you; you want to avoid spilling it.

**Rule Number Two** is to stay alert to potential dangers. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Practice how long it takes to stop by braking gently. You might be going faster than you realize. Generally, allow double your usual stopping distance on wet roads, three times that on snow, and even more on ice. Always try to keep control of your car to prevent accidents."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London with the plan to study law, but instead, he went to art school. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government funded his art studies, and he became fascinated by early Italian artists, which is reflected in some of his artwork. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. 

To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, but he admits he is never certain about the final outcome. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start with yellow, knowing what I will add on top."" Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it seem simple. He believes, ""Anyone can use the colors - you can buy them. I just pay attention to what colors are next to each other.""

Unlike some artists, Aitchison does not create sketches before starting a painting. He feels that making sketches might make him lose interest in the actual painting. Instead, he often changes his paintings multiple times before they are complete. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. He says, ""If I sense they are anxious and want to look at the painting, I can't continue.""

Since moving to London, Aitchison has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any artistic tradition; he simply paints in his own way. Nevertheless, his work continues to inspire young British artists."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because we were worried about the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" Eventually, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you need to think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit unusual, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical talent—after all, I didn't expect my parents to enjoy the same music I liked as a teenager—but they do perform regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but that hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. This college offers students valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to prepare for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from various countries, study in the mornings. In the afternoons, they participate in meaningful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best aspects of Atlantic College is its diverse student body, which includes individuals from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the tuition fees are £20,000 for two years, many students rely on grants to attend. About 25% of the students are British, and many of them can only go to the college with government support.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed that I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education through effective methods that truly benefit its students."
PET_47,"**Being an Older Student**

At 32, I have just completed my first year at university. Along with attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not challenge me. I became increasingly unhappy with the idea of being stuck in that job. I envied the students at the local university, who seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

Now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is important for getting a good job, which matters a lot to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends studying rather than going out to parties. I also enjoy the typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas.

I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life is a smart decision."
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born in 1863 on a farm in Michigan, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic, and in 1893, he created his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and then built two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet lightweight steel, he produced affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which was priced at $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_19,"**Rebecca Stevens**

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small apartment in south London. In 1993, Rebecca decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with a group of climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very challenging. She said, ""You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even bring a toothbrush. I usually like to stay clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the happiest moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. She has since written a book about her journey, and people often invite her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. Although Rebecca is now well-known and has more money, she still lives in her small flat in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains."

KET_13,"**CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds would not survive if they stayed there. 

Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. These young birds had lost their parents. Bill realized that they would not know how to migrate in the autumn. He owned a small plane and decided to teach the geese to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him.

When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home.

This spring, Bill waited for the geese to come back, but they did not arrive. Concerned, he flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way back home on their own!"
KET_16,"**ESTHER'S STORY**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, she decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 per jar to her friends and quickly doubled her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not supportive of her decision. They wanted her to focus on studying and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling it at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where a friend worked.

After two years, her business had grown significantly, and her parents were proud of her. She produced various types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some employees to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens, selling milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each one produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them comfortable.

Five years ago, Jenny tried to sell sweaters made from the wool at country markets, but it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which became very popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business began. Initially, she made the socks at home, but soon she gained thousands of customers, so she had to send the wool to a factory where machines now produce all the socks.

The socks come in six colors and five sizes, suitable for all ages, and there are different types for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, she has many letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"**BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON**

According to the police, most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He noted that 67% of these crimes happen when people leave their homes and forget to close doors or windows. 

Inspector Saunders mentioned that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are particularly favorable for burglars since it gets dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Many houses are also empty during this time because people are still at work.

To help prevent burglaries, Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday. This can deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when someone is away and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious. 

""We can also provide advice on how to make your home safer,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This assistance is free of charge."""
KET_27,"Dear Lynne and Tony,

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming began, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These individuals were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, leading to the growth of larger villages. As a result, some villagers could focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming could be challenging, especially during bad weather, which sometimes left people without enough food. Today, farmers can produce more food, which can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes."
KET_22,"**WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE**

Nicola Peet finished school at eighteen, attended college, and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she began working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later joined British Airways as a flight attendant. Four years later, she became a manager. Here is what she shared about her job:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time flying. I train flight attendants and assist them with any issues. I also attend many meetings. My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. 

At work, the first thing I do is check flight schedules on my computer, and then I talk to some of the flight attendants. Occasionally, I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are performing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, all I want to do is eat something and then go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""

KET_62,"The Weather People study the weather for many reasons, and it is important for various professions. For instance, weather significantly affects farmers. In the past, farmers would spend a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Nowadays, there are many computer programs that help us predict the weather, and people can access weather information on their mobile phones. Despite this, many people still hold onto traditional beliefs about the weather. For example, some say that a red sky in the evening means it will be sunny the next day, and others believe that if cows lie down in the fields, rain is coming soon."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small town in Canada. They have been friends and classmates for a long time. Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing and swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework; instead, they have created a new computer word game.

The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who struggles with reading. Kevin finds it easier to learn words by seeing pictures and hearing sounds rather than by reading. Frazer wanted to help him. Together, Frazer and Peter dedicated over 200 hours to develop this computer game, which is now ready to use. 

The game combines speaking and pictures. For instance, when you see the word ""hat,"" there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying ""Hat! Hat!"" at the same time. The boys have received many awards for their game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in purchasing it."

Getting enough sleep is very important. When I return to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, after a concert, I find it hard to sleep because my mind is filled with music. 

Sports are also important. Before my car accident, I used to spend two and a half hours a day at the sports center, five days a week. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups each day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat healthily. I also drink a lot of water because it is good for your health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I don’t always manage that.

People should not work all the time. I love my job, but I also enjoy other activities. In my free time, I like to listen to music or watch TV. It is beneficial to relax sometimes. Since the doctor advised me to eat better, I no longer feel tired. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day, but I still enjoy burgers occasionally!"

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, and it produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, far surpassing the USA. Watching films is the most popular leisure activity for many Indians, with around ten million people going to the cinema every day. 

Bollywood films often focus on romantic love stories, and they include a lot of singing and dancing. These films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors produce more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films have a production cost of about $2 million, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million to make.

Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers are often short. Amitabh Bachchan, who is considered by some to be India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted almost 40 years."
KET_37,"Bill Bryson

I was born in the United States, but I have written many travel books about England. I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years. For the last three years, we have been back in the United States. Our children are now experiencing life here, and I believe they will be happier because they have lived in two different countries. I enjoy Britain and want to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is starting college here soon, so it will be another four years before we go back.

Recently, I spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to promote my new book. Many writers dislike this part of the job; they don’t enjoy traveling around to sell their books. However, I don’t mind it. I like exploring new places and meeting many people. This experience is very different from my writing life in the United States. In England, I was driven around in large cars and stayed in nice hotels. It was great because I didn’t have to pay for anything. Everyone was friendly, and I had a lot of fun."
KET_2,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes arrived in England over 50 years ago, while the Giant Schnauzer is a more recent addition. The name ""Giant"" is fitting because these dogs stand between 65 and 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs regular grooming. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is typically black. 

Schnauzers originate from Germany, where they assist farmers with sheep herding. They are also used by the police due to their high intelligence. Schnauzers make great family pets; they are friendly and get along well with young children."
KET_23,"The Ruwenzori Mountains

Mary Daniels is a student from England. This year, she had a fascinating summer holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. Their purpose was to help build a road through a forest that connects two large towns. 

Mary described the experience as very challenging because there was no drinking water and no shops to buy food. She also mentioned that it was very cold and rainy in the mountains, which are known to be one of the wettest places in the world. 

Mary spent six weeks in the mountains. Although the work was tough, she believes it was the best experience of her life. She hopes to return next year to continue her work there."
KET_60,"Dear Keira,

Thank you for your letter. Today was my first day at my new school. A girl named Nicole helped me and showed me where the classrooms are. She is very nice, and I plan to visit her this weekend. My favorite lesson today was Maths, and I was happy because I understood more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time, and I really enjoyed it. Most of the teachers seem friendly, but I am a bit scared of the head teacher. No one seems to like him because he shouts a lot. I have to go now because I need to do my homework.

KET_1,"**New Books This Month**

**The Long Night**  
This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for several years. The story follows Maha, a nurse in northern Australia, who works in a small hospital. One day, a baby becomes very ill, and Maha must drive all night to take her to the nearest big city. They face many challenges on their journey.

**Hard Work**  
This exciting story is Joanna Jones's twentieth book. It tells the tale of Sombat, who works with his father, a carpenter, in Thailand. They spend long hours making tables and chairs, but they struggle to earn money. One day, a man dressed in black comes into their shop and buys the most beautiful table.

**Hospital or Cinema?**  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. It is about Tina, a young Brazilian woman whose dream is to become a doctor. She travels to London to study English and medicine. However, one day she meets a man who invites her to the USA to become a film star. What choice will Tina make?"
KET_53,"The History of Horse Racing

Horse racing has been an important sport since the earliest history books were written. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started in the 12th century when Arab horses were brought to Europe. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses, but this changed at the start of the 18th century. Races became shorter and included multiple horses competing against each other. Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball, and it is also very popular in many other parts of the world."
KET_55,"Nick Barlow is a world traveler and a British actor who enjoys his job. He travels globally to create TV shows. ""People are friendly to me wherever I go, and when I return home, I think about all the amazing experiences I've had in different countries,"" he shares. Although Nick has visited many places, he still wants to travel to South America and return to Australia someday.

On his trips, Nick works with a team that brings cameras and other equipment for filming. He doesn't pack much for himself, just a few shirts and trousers, but he always includes some books in his suitcase. His wife, Helen, supports his travels for work. She has many friends and stays busy while he is away. When he returns, she enjoys hearing about his adventures.

However, there can be challenges. While in the Malaysian rainforest, Nick learned that his wife was in the hospital. ""I felt awful because I couldn't be there to help her, but she insisted that I stay. I was so relieved when I found out she was better."""
KET_50,"**Parrots**

You may have seen these beautiful birds with their vibrant colors and long tails in forests or zoos. Parrots are found in countries such as Brazil, Australia, and India. They typically live in large groups and enjoy eating fruit, which can sometimes cause problems for farmers. There are many different species of parrots, but all of them have strong beaks and feet that help them climb and hold food. The largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are quite noisy, but they are intelligent and can be taught to talk easily. Some zoos even have parrot shows where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"HOWARD BONNIER Bray is a lovely village located about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there around three and a half months ago. Although not many people in Britain know his name yet, he is already quite well-known in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in the country. At just 29 years old, Howard has a passion for food. 

As a teenager, he often visited restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed these experiences so much that he chose to spend his money on trips to France and dining at fine restaurants instead of buying clothes and CDs. He also collected many cookbooks, claiming to have over two hundred and fifty! 

So, why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply put, he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He admits that starting a restaurant is expensive and that cooking for fifty people is much harder than cooking for his family. However, he believes he has made the right choice."
KET_34,"In a small town in central England, John Pickering mows the grass and waters the flowers in a park. However, last week he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television because he is currently the top singer in Japan. A few months ago, John traveled to Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey discovered his songs and played them on his radio show. Many young listeners called in, asking the disc jockey to play his songs again. John, who goes by the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, plans to continue his job in the park in England. He is unsure how much money he will make from his music. ""I need to keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have bills to pay!"" The other gardeners are unaware of his fame in Japan and have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This won't change our lifestyle. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"**Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. In nearly every town, you can find clubs and classes for this fun activity. 

""Line dancing is simple to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to meet new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. The boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!""

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began around fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"The Rhino

There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the other types are found in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough, and they have very little hair. A rhino's body rests on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and their diet consists mainly of grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilos at birth and stays in its mother for around fifteen months. An adult rhino can weigh over 200 kilos and may live for up to 50 years."
KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, we see police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid well. Around 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people lived in poverty. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, which made people stay at home as much as possible.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of individuals to catch thieves. They were similar to police officers and were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had expanded significantly and needed more police.

So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established with 3,000 officers. Most of these men patrolled on foot, while a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are paid quite well, and those who still ride horses earn even higher salaries than their colleagues."
KET_30,"Attention Students: 

Are you interested in joining a camping trip this weekend? We will travel to the forest by school bus and stay at a campsite from Friday to Sunday. The campsite has hot showers, a small shop, and bicycle rentals. The cost of the trip is £25. It gets very cold at night, so please bring warm clothing and sturdy shoes. If you would like to participate, please let me know today.

KET_7,"Text: 'Experience the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is filled with actors and artists from around the world. They come to participate in the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are vibrant with music and dance from morning until night. You can even watch artists create paintings on the streets. A highlight of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Tens of thousands of visitors come to see new films, plays, and listen to music from famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite stars in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but keep in mind that finding a place to stay can be challenging, so consider booking your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they fish for the fish swimming beneath the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

To fish, you first break the ice and make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and lower it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people enjoy eating them, but after I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I have caught twenty-five! It's a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

One well-known tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Visitors can see wax figures of many famous people there. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures and opened a museum in Paris. Marie assisted him with this work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was imprisoned. While in prison, she had to create wax models of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures are still on display today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were quite expensive, and only wealthy individuals could afford them. These early models looked very different from modern bicycles. Over time, as prices decreased, more people began to buy bicycles. They started using them for commuting and leisure activities. 

Today, cars are more commonly used than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to cycle to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it difficult to find parking."
KET_63,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went directly to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers would give a new brush filled with paint to each elephant and take away the old one. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer do that, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it’s hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These groups often work together to hunt for food. Lions typically inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and track other animals easily. All cats rely on their excellent eyesight to catch smaller prey. They also need to be fast and strong."
KET_36,"Dear Mrs. Brian,

KET_20,"**THE OSTRICH**

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, with adults weighing over 90 kilograms. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are decreasing. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. Instead, they use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches are very fast runners, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around three years to grow into adults. They primarily eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"Snowboarding

Victoria Jamieson, a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain, began snowboarding at the age of 20. She has achieved success in many competitions. We spoke to her last week at a snowboarding event in Switzerland and asked her why she chose this sport. She said, ""I have always enjoyed sports, especially skiing, so it felt natural to try snowboarding. It’s easy to learn, and you can become quite skilled in just a few months.""

We also inquired about her practice routine. She explained, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I truly enjoy all of it! I love the competitions and being in the mountains; it’s so beautiful. However, free-riding—doing what you want outside of competitions—is the best part for me.""

Finally, we asked her what is important when learning to snowboard. She replied, ""You can learn quickly, but taking lessons is essential. Having the right clothing is also important to stay dry, especially since you will fall a lot at first!"""

KET_64,"**Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man, have successfully climbed it. There are several routes to reach the summit, and the Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. This route usually takes about five days and is very popular among tourists. However, only half of those who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro actually reach the top. This is often due to the unpredictable weather. At the start of the climb, it can be hot and rainy, but as climbers approach the summit, they encounter ice and snow, with temperatures dropping below 20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, climbers should pack both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"**Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were so polluted that many fish and insects died, leaving otters without food. However, today the rivers are clean again, and there is plenty of food for them."

KET_59,"**Buildings**

People have always created buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. Other buildings, like museums, are used to display beautiful items. 

Many people collaborate on a building project. The architect designs how the building will look and creates drawings to share their ideas. Engineers ensure that the building is strong and safe. Finally, workers carefully construct it.

The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a stunning roof. However, it is beautiful from all angles, not just the top. Another famous structure is the Olympic Stadium in Munich, which has a unique roof that resembles a glass tent."

KET_32,"The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in southern England that are close to each other. Between them, you can find many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large figure of a man. This figure is called the Cerne Giant because it is near the village of Cerne. The exact date when the Cerne Giant was created is unknown, but it is believed to be very old. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the figure. If you visit on May 1st at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill."
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the top runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she plans to compete in the 10,000 metres and possibly the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in major competitions, but she always remained cheerful, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of any British woman that year.

Gail's husband and manager, Mike Rollins, used to compete in races too, but he had to stop due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail, but it can be frustrating for him when she runs ahead and he can't keep up. Gail trains hard, doing long runs in the morning and faster runs in the afternoon, but she always takes Sundays off from running. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. When Ivan was six, his mother started teaching him the piano. By the age of ten, he wanted to write music and began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, Oleg began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. He quickly started winning prizes for his piano skills. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six years old. When he was ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef has always loved music, but he is also interested in physics and languages. Although he is very busy now, he hopes to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"**Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith worked as a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he started writing children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he shares his work with his wife, who tells him what she thinks. ""She lets me know when she doesn't like something,"" Bill explains. His ten grandchildren, who live far away, also read his stories and give their opinions.

Through this feedback, Bill has learned what young children enjoy reading. He often writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, titled *The Sheepdog*, which tells the story of a farmer and his helpful dog. ""I have always loved animals,"" Bill says, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly.""

Last year, *The Sheepdog* was turned into a film featuring real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced computer technology to make it seem like the animals were talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change the story of a book, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually feature images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many individuals send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the images are often more appealing than personal photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, and it displayed a picture of a seaside town. Over time, postcards began to show images related to current events, such as accidents or visits from important figures. People appreciated these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include pictures."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur because the last one died about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. The exact reason for their extinction is still unknown. Birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. 

Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were over 5,000 different types. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and primarily ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was smaller but much stronger, with sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run quickly due to its long back legs."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can potentially kill a person. They are skilled climbers and can run quickly. However, bears do not have good eyesight and, like many animals, they rely on their sense of smell to find food. 

There are seven species of bears. The largest is the polar bear, which can grow to nearly three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one inhabits the forests of North America, while the other is found in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, not all black bears are actually black; some can be dark brown or reddish-brown. 

The black and white panda bear, native to China, is beloved by many. Unfortunately, there are not many pandas left in the wild today because they struggle to find enough food."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles are found in tropical regions around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually live in slow-moving water, but they can swim quickly and move fast on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. Their diet includes fish, birds, and small animals, but they can also hunt larger animals and even humans. There are more than ten different species of crocodiles, all of which have very sharp teeth. Although they frequently lose teeth, they quickly grow new ones. Typically, crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. They have a long lifespan; the oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and successfully flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes underwent significant changes. By the 1950s, they became much faster due to the introduction of jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, capable of flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, which allows the trip from London to New York to take only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, making it hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was quite different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people would get cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, located by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, chat with friends, walk around during the performance, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same location by the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
KET_48,"Dear Jeff,

I hope you are well. I am enjoying my holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and cold. However, it has improved, and now we go to the beach every day. This week, we are in Sydney, but next week we will visit the Great Barrier Reef. The water is very warm, and I really enjoy swimming there. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, and purple! Australia is truly beautiful, and we don’t want to go home! I will see you at the end of September.

Best,  
Sue"
