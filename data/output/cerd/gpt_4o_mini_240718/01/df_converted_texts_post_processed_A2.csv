CPE_15,C2,"**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for money. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have a regular service to collect their rubbish. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a dump. This service is usually free. Families pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, collecting rubbish is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more money local governments spend on dumping it.
If rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish. A simple solution is to make families pay for the rubbish they throw away. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, if local governments help with recycling. 
Two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, studied some towns in the U.S. that started charging families for rubbish. The most common way was to sell stickers that families put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with these stickers were picked up. In one town, Charlottesville, Virginia, families paid 80 cents for each sticker. 
At first, this seemed like a good idea. The number of bags thrown away dropped by 37%. But many people just packed more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more stickers. This is not good because machines at dumps can compact rubbish better than people can. The total weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In other towns without a pricing system, the weight of rubbish also fell, but by only 3.5%. 
Some people even started to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. This illegal dumping might be responsible for 30-40% of the drop in collected rubbish. However, there was a positive side: recycling increased by 15%. This means people chose to recycle instead of paying to throw away their rubbish. But many people were already recycling before the new fees.
In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish disposal in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. For example, if sticker prices go up by 10%, the amount of rubbish only goes down by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To throw away much less rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to change much.
It is also important to think about other factors, like income and education. In richer towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, should we say that charging families for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really. Free disposal is too cheap. But the effects of these simple ideas can be complicated. We often need detailed studies to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Life by Theodore Zeldin**
Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. 
Loving your job used to be enough to feel special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and unable to talk to others, then no amount of money or status will make you happy. 
Zeldin wants to find ways for work to help us feel fulfilled. Work should not just be about making money; it should help us live better lives and discover new talents. However, just creating more jobs is not enough. As people learn more, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.
Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and architects, can be stressful and unfulfilling. Many workers feel lost in their roles, and companies are not helping them feel connected to their work. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match those of their companies.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He is looking at important topics like happiness, love, and respect. He believes we need to think about who we want to work with and how we can feel more alive at work. 
For example, many people work in hotels, but they often feel unappreciated and overworked. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and share experiences. Hotel workers could use their skills and knowledge to create better connections with guests.
Zeldin believes that work is about relationships. Many people want to feel independent and should be able to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues. Good communication is important, but it should be more than just talking. Real conversations create respect and understanding between people. 
Every time we have a meaningful conversation, we can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant to spread seeds widely by hand. It is not just about farming; it also represents hope for growth and success. This idea suggests that there are resources available to help spread information and ideas.
We need to understand why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, can allow two-way communication. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a way to send information to many people at once from a central place. This way of broadcasting matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some attempts to create different ways of using television. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain tried to make two-way television to replace regular telephones. Many science magazines wrote about how to build television equipment, and many people experimented with it. But in 1938, big companies agreed on rules for television that pushed these amateur efforts aside. This was a missed chance for television to develop as a more equal way of communication.
Broadcasting was connected to strong economic interests and the structure of modern societies. Even though there were amateur TV activities, television was mostly used for public shows in the USA in the early 1930s. Many people watched television in public places, especially in Britain and Germany.
The idea of amateur two-way television was not successful. Instead, companies wanted to sell television sets for homes. As working-class people began to earn more money in the 1920s, having a home filled with entertainment became possible for many people in Western countries. Now, this is happening all over the world.
There is a clear link between social changes and how broadcasting works. As societies modernized, power and money became more concentrated, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile, which made them feel more isolated compared to earlier, stable communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with all citizens and created a sense of community in the nation.
Broadcasting became the main way to share information through radio and television. However, there is also a positive view of broadcasting as a way to support democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure everyone had access to important information for participating in society.
Television is changing now, and the term broadcasting may not fit as well as before. In the future, it may only refer to a specific way of using audio-visual technology during a certain time of social change."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still do not feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes we want too many things. Modern advertising makes us feel insecure. It tells us that if we do not have certain things, we are not good enough. 
To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any ads when you walk down the street. We see many ads on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. All of these tell us to buy more things.
**Caves**
Many researchers and universities study caves. They look at where caves come from, how water moves in them, and the plants and animals that live there. Caves are small but interesting parts of nature. They make us curious and want to learn more. Because caves are natural, people have studied them for a long time, especially in places where caves affect our lives. 
However, visiting many caves can be hard, so cave research is often done by people who enjoy exploring caves, not just by scientists.
**Weather Watch**
Many people have watched the weather for a long time without any special tools. This helped create the science of meteorology, which has become very advanced since the 17th century. Now, satellites and electronic tools give us a lot of weather information quickly. Computers can solve complex math problems much faster than people can.
Meteorology uses many difficult words that are hard to understand. But human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. What people observe can help scientists understand the weather better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Not long ago, I thought that opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. But I come from the world of theatre, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language of the actors.
At any music performance, like in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people who do not know much about music. Some might feel embarrassed about this. Most people are amazed by the talent of the musicians. A great singer or a good orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of many years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match. We know athletes do something similar to what we do when we run, but we see how much better they are.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand how skilled an actor is and may not be very impressed by what they see. They might ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" but they do not usually feel amazed when an actor finishes a long speech. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; many people enjoy both. In theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal ground, no matter how difficult the play is.
The question is, can music learn anything from theatre? I think yes. I have seen how a different approach can make the experience of concert-goers better. Live music is very theatrical, full of feelings, and can connect with the audience. However, the way music is often presented, with strict dress codes and a lot of respect for conductors and soloists, can make it feel like there is a big difference between the musicians and the audience.
Sometimes, music audiences clap between songs or after a great performance. This is a way to show appreciation, but it can also interrupt the flow of the music. Is there a solution? Yes, many people are working to bring new audiences to concerts and opera houses and to make them feel that ""serious"" music is for everyone.
I remember a special event called ""In Search of Angels,"" where the performance moved around a cathedral and into the town. It was a wonderful musical experience, and many audience members were not just watching but also taking part. I wish music could have more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. Sometimes, this can happen in unusual places, where expectations are changed. This can create surprising effects for both performers and the audience. 
I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that music can and should change how it is presented. I am just a fan of both theatre and music. I love them and want more people to enjoy the pleasure of being part of the audience."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
I think sand is amazing because it can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete. But I do not like it when it is just sand on the beach. To me, sand is a problem. It gets in my face, my food, and can even hide important things like car keys and coins. When I am wet, sand sticks to me and is hard to wash off, even with a lot of water. But when I step on a towel, get in a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off easily. For days, I find sand everywhere when I take off my shoes and socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. So, I do not want sand around me.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. A long time ago, they used simple locks, but now we have electronic locks that use cards. However, many people still prefer to use a real key. They feel safer when they can turn a key in a lock. One company made a new electronic lock but included a real metal key because people want that feeling of safety.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery because I do not understand modern art very well. I like some of it, especially soft things, bright light sculptures, and big photos. I think if I knew more about art, I would have more opinions. But art is not just about understanding; it is about feeling something. This gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I saw was the labels next to the art. These labels explained what the art was about. Instead of just looking at the pictures, I could learn more and understand them better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Making a movie from a book often means cutting down the story. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. When I worked on a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This does not mean that the original words were not important. It is about how each type of story (books and movies) asks the audience to pay attention in different ways.
In a book, we often repeat important details about characters and use phrases like ""he said"" to help readers understand. We only need to describe a character once, but reminding readers helps them remember. In movies, we can often tell who is speaking just by looking at the scene, but using speech tags can make it easier to follow.
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives for a while. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, we are back in the real world. Some people, like our parents and teachers, thought movies were just for fun and not real art. They enjoyed watching movies but did not see them as something important.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were no clear signs. There were three main entrances, but they all looked the same. It was confusing for anyone who did not work there. However, the people who worked there knew how to get around. Because of their hard work, people could enjoy stories of romance and adventure in movies. Couples like Jane and George, or Sally and Dick, could escape their everyday problems for a few hours thanks to the studio.
**Film-Makers**
Many people want to make movies. Bookstores have many books about how to write scripts and make films. Universities offer classes on this too. There are contests where you can win a camera to make your own movie. Robert Rodriguez made a famous film called El Mariachi for only $7,000, and it helped him become a well-known director. He wrote about how he wanted to make his big movie before he turned 26, just like famous directors did when they were young.
In the past, it took longer for directors to start making movies. They often worked in other jobs first, like editing or writing. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann started directing in his forties. But now, many new filmmakers have to find their own way without the help of big studios or TV."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, there were many council houses on the western side of the city. These houses were small and not very nice, made of orange brick or white plaster. In the summer, a bad smell from a factory nearby filled the air. In the mornings, you could often see a paperboy making a face because of the smell as he walked to deliver papers. I don’t remember much from my early life, but I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses far away. 
I also remember my mother. She was a small woman who often seemed angry, and I never really understood why. When I went with her to the shops, I noticed that she was very alone, even in a crowd. She cared a lot about behaving properly, which was not common in our neighborhood. This meant we had to keep off our neighbors' gardens and sit quietly at the dining table, listening to the radio. There were many rules I didn’t understand.
My mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who hardly spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. Looking back, I see that they often talked about sad things, like their health and their children. I felt like I was part of their conversations, even when I didn’t want to be.
Growing up in West Earlham was not easy. Until I was five, I stayed at home and played while my mother sat in her chair. After I turned five, I went to school half a mile away. Some kids had mothers who rode bikes, but mine let me walk with other children. 
I remember summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his life at sea. Once, there was a charity event where a kind woman offered lemonade, but my mother didn’t want to join because she thought they just wanted money. My mother often talked about how people were greedy, especially politicians.
My mother did care about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on the bus. We looked at paintings together. She even made a joke once about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying she wouldn’t want to meet him at night. This was a rare moment of fun with her."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. The Krings and the Pottses lived nearby, and they were my first friends, all girls. 
The houses on this street were special to me, even if I didn’t know everyone’s name. I remembered the little channels in the cement that carried rain from the roofs to the street. I used to skate and ride my scooter over them. As the street went down, the houses changed too. The porches got lower, and the front yards got smaller. 
Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones. In Shillington, some houses I remembered became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be filled with products. 
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has big doors and exposed brick walls. But Rick did not want his flat to be completely open. He said it was hard to work when everything was in view. So, he used a big piece of plastic to create a hallway and hide his office. 
He wanted his kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To make the flat feel warmer, he put light wood on the floors. He has modern chairs and sofas, but he also has furniture from his parents and things he bought at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. He wrote a famous book called *In Patagonia* in 1977. This book changed travel writing. It was exciting and imaginative, like a thriller or a romantic story. 
Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories better. He believed that traveling could help people discover amazing histories and adventures.
**Swimming**
One summer day, it was raining heavily. I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. I swam back and forth, watching the raindrops create bubbles in the water. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds disappeared. 
During this summer in 1996, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea. I felt frustrated with my life, always going back and forth like a tiger in a cage. 
Many places today have signs and labels, making everything feel the same. But walking, cycling, and swimming let us explore the wild and old parts of the world. A swimming journey would help me discover the mysteries of nature, like dark woods and high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose for humans. But he was probably wrong. Scientists today say that crying is important for social reasons. For example, psychiatrist John Bowlby showed that crying helps create a strong bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that children cry because they feel helpless.
It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel close. 
People cry for different reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We may also cry when we watch a sad movie, and this happens more often when we are with other people than when we are alone. 
Crying has a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get? How will it change our lives? Most people have some idea about global warming, but they are not sure what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere affects everything on Earth, these changes will also impact plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans use natural resources to help us live. We grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. If these resources change, it is a serious problem. We need to understand how the world will change and what is causing these changes. 
In the last 100 years, human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere. These gases are connected to global temperature. It seems that these gases are already affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how everything works together. 
Scientists have found that the Earth has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just natural and is partly caused by human pollution. Many scientists are trying to predict what will happen because of higher global temperatures. They use special computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to help them. These programs look at temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors to make predictions about the climate. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. The predictions suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. Sea levels will also rise by 15 to 95 cm, and there will be changes in rainfall patterns. Scientists expect more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts.
These changes will affect the environment and humans. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are located, what plants and animals live there, and how these areas provide resources we need. This includes food, water, and places to live. Some effects may be very bad, but not all changes will be negative. In some places, like Australia, warmer temperatures have helped increase wheat production.
However, small changes in climate can also lead to water shortages, especially in dry areas. For example, in the Mediterranean region, there has been less rainfall in recent years. This can cause problems for people and nature. 
Another issue is that glaciers are melting, which affects ice and water levels. The Arctic ice is melting, which makes it easier for ships to travel but also increases the risk of icebergs. 
The most visible effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this. Many people live in coastal areas, so rising sea levels can cause serious problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face flooding, and many people could lose their homes. 
Small island countries are at the greatest risk. If sea levels rise too much, these islands could disappear. This would be devastating for the people living there and for other countries that would have to help those who are displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars
Wanted: a married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. The couple should be healthy and strong. This will be the first group of astronauts to go to Mars if Dennis Tito's plans work. He wants to send a spacecraft on 5 January 2018. The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. Saving fuel is very important. The trip must happen in 2018 because the next time Mars and Earth are close is in 2031. 
There is a lot of work to create new technology for this mission. If everything is ready in time, the spacecraft might go. Even if it does not leave Earth, the work will help future missions to Mars.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Art is important, but sometimes it is hard to understand. This is because we often think of art as just a building, a book, a painting, or a statue. We forget that art is also about how people feel and experience it. When we only look at the art itself, we miss its true meaning.
Some artworks are very famous and admired. Because of this, people create rules about them that can stop new ideas. When art becomes a classic, it can feel separate from the people and the life experiences that created it. This makes it hard to see why art is important in our lives.
To understand art better, we need to connect it to our everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our daily lives. People who study art should help us see this connection.
To really understand art, we might need to forget about it for a moment. We should look at the simple things in life that we enjoy. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about how they grow. But if we want to understand how they grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.
Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When art is only seen in museums, people often look for enjoyment in other places. Some people do not like the idea of art being only in museums, but they still think of art as separate from everyday life.
When art is connected to our daily activities, we appreciate it more. The best times to enjoy art are when it is part of our normal experiences."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Lions are often seen as amazing hunters. In stories, they work together to catch their food, moving quietly and quickly. They seem like friendly animals that help each other. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we learned that they are not always like this. 
When we started our research in 1978, we wanted to know why lions hunt together, take care of their young, and scare away other animals with their loud roars. We thought that working together would help them have more baby lions. But sometimes, if one lion helps too much, it can lose out. So, we wondered why lions still work together. We thought we would find answers in two or three years, but lions are very good at resting. 
Because lions can live up to 18 years, it has taken a long time to understand their behavior.
**Pop Music Review**
Bedrock's third album was very important for the band. The album, called *New Life*, changed rock music in the country for many years. It moved away from the serious and dark music of the past and brought in lighter and more fun sounds. 
The music mixed social ideas with humor and had a mix of different styles. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting ideas and writing songs. They wrote about everyday things like sunbathing and relaxing on Sundays. But the best songs were deeper, like ""So Low,"" which was about the weather, and ""To the Brink,"" which was a serious ballad. 
*New Life* is special because it has 16 great songs with no bad ones, which is rare for long albums.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I loved stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. I first heard about one from my mother. An old woman from Cumae tried to sell King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. He said no, so she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still said no, so she burned three more. Finally, he bought the last three for 300 gold pieces. I learned a lesson about sales and life from this story.
I was often lonely as a child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother told me to do something interesting so they would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson.
When I got the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I liked. I don’t like to travel much, so I gave my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to go. I prefer to think about old ruins because I enjoy traveling in my mind through time.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript (your written work), it will probably go into a big pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read. This pile is called the slush pile. Usually, a young person or an experienced worker will look at it. They want to find something new and interesting.
If they like your work, they will show it to a senior editor. This editor will decide if your manuscript is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about whether you, as an author, can be successful in the future. Publishers often want to meet authors before they make an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you work in advertising, the early 1990s were very hard years. The economy was in a recession, which means many businesses were struggling. This recession was worse than expected and lasted a long time. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. More than half a million people were unemployed, and many homes were taken back by banks because people could not pay their mortgages. Every business was affected, especially the car and building industries, which saw a big drop in sales.
People in advertising were not the only ones losing their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, but they had to do this with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money. At the same time, companies started to realize that marketing was very important. They needed to make products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies began to focus more on marketing.
Because of this, marketing people started to get more respect, but they also had more work to do. Many people thought that marketing could solve all problems, but this was not true. About half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising, so advertising people felt the pressure. The 1980s were good for advertising, but the early 1990s were very difficult. The bad economy made companies cut their advertising budgets and think more about how effective their advertising was.
Companies wanted to know what they were getting for their money. They needed proof that advertising worked. Many companies said they wanted better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better results from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working for them and to be very motivated.
Even though advertising is a tough business, many advertising workers faced the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less money. The recession made it hard to spend money on advertising, and companies were afraid to take risks, which are often needed for good advertising. Other changes were happening too, like changes in the population, the power of retailers, and new laws about advertising. Some companies also had to learn how to advertise in other countries.
Because of the economy and these changes, advertising people had to think about the saying: ""Only half of my advertising works. The trouble is I don’t know which half."" Now, more than ever, they needed to make sure their advertising was effective. However, help for them was not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies were too busy dealing with problems to share their experiences. Those who were successful often kept their methods secret. This meant that while some events could help, many books and resources about advertising did not provide useful information. They often made it seem like all advertising work was perfect, which was not true and did not help the people who needed to make advertising work better."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Kitchen's Appeal**
When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people wanted different jobs. Being a chef seemed hard and not very nice. Chefs work long hours, have a lot of pressure, do simple tasks, and do not earn much money. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed and too serious. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from this. It promised a real purpose that I did not find in college.
My wish to cook was not just because I was a student. I also loved the beauty of cooking. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I remember my first dish very well. After that meal, I wanted to learn all the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life to prepare for becoming a chef. My history degree felt unimportant, and I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The swimming teacher at my school was a tough man with strong muscles and tattoos. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he would say things like, ""Don't look down, look up!"" and ""Keep your legs straight!""
The following week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I felt scared. I tried to remember what I learned, waved my arms, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment. But I still felt very happy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For people who like comfort, like a nice bed and running water, the traveller seems strange and interesting. These are people who choose to take risks. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone on small boats, and eat insects if they have to. They can live for months in unknown places. Some people think these travellers are odd, and they are different from us. We can ignore them and be happy in our own lives with microwaves and phones, where the risks are small and predictable.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is why he spends a lot of time on it. He does not say he is a great sailor, but he is good enough. He sails because he is a writer and wants to write about his experiences. Sailing gives him stories to tell.
Raban's small boat has a device that tells him exactly where he is on the earth. He likes this tool, but he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people connect with the sea. Now, sailors look at the compass instead of watching the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, is now just a space to cross. Because of this, a sailor can let a machine steer the boat for a long time. This is why Raban has time to watch the waves carefully."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books from the past or from faraway places. In these books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express what we feel but in a clearer way. They can say what we are shy or confused about, and this can be surprising, especially if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves.
When we read or travel, we can escape our daily routines. Our eyes are wide open when we first arrive in a new place. This is also true when we read a great book, which helps us notice things we usually ignore. Our minds become more aware of the world around us. We start to see the colors of the sky, the changes in a person's face, or feelings we didn’t know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel thoughts were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to the original articles, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but I did not want to change too much. For example, in my article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to show this, it would not be the same as what I felt at that time. Like many travelers, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what I saw.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to make sure their trips did not harm the places they visited. Soon, ""ecotourism"" became a popular term for holidays. Now, it can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a short boat trip in Australia. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is often called ecotourism. While the original idea was good, the lack of rules made it hard for travelers to know what ecotourism really means.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago. It helped me remember that time, but it was not perfect. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected. I moved from one friendly house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. I worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, but then I realized it didn’t matter much. So, I let the story tell itself without too many worries."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought to be a new idea that started with capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many historians say that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often look at the growth of trade in the 16th and 17th centuries as the beginning of fashion. As societies grew and changed, more people needed different types of clothing, and new ways to make clothes were invented. Because of this, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say what a piece of clothing really means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people and in different situations.
**Writer**
Stories in newspapers about famous authors can give a wrong idea about what life is like for most writers. For many of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to earn money. The smartest writers work at other jobs during the day and write in the evenings. This way, they have a steady income even if their book does not become popular. Others, like me, do different small jobs, such as teaching and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found something like that. Still, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places where we performed started to fill up with fans, and we needed extra security to keep the excited girls back. We had to use secret doors to enter the places we were playing to avoid being overwhelmed by fans. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to go outside without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of everything we needed. Even though I was still shy, I felt a strange confidence that many shy people can understand when they suddenly become famous. In short, I felt very out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Ahead**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, there are fewer live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for musicians.
More people can access music now, and this is likely to continue because music meets many human needs. In Britain, music is important for national events and personal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.
I believe that people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of the economy in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Also, playing an instrument can help develop skills in children. Research in the USA shows that making music can improve thinking skills. Studies in Europe suggest that group music lessons can help children make friends and focus better in school.
Current research is looking at how playing an instrument can help people learn other skills. For example, practicing regularly can help with good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of this, there will likely be a continued need for music lessons in the near future.
What about the future? I think two things will happen. First, people will listen to more types of music, mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music. This will make it easier for people to compose music without needing a lot of technical skills, but it may also mean fewer live performances.
More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities, reflecting their local musical traditions. To prepare for this future, music education needs to change. We need to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means music lessons will need to adapt to be relevant for more people.
Musicians will need training to inspire and teach learners of all ages. They will also need skills to work with different groups and manage community projects. This is a big change from how things are done now, and it will require accountability to the public. 
This is a chance for everyone in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is essential, but we often take it for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people do not respect actors. This is often because actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their feelings, they use boring phrases or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that acting is only interesting when it is happening. Talking about it makes it less real. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn new things about their character and the story. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next performance. This emptiness shows when people talk about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet, a character between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but strong. He shows great control and confidence. Lester plays a young man who feels angry but also has a sense of humor. His acting is very skilled. You can see how he moves his body, waiting to act. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio and also shows a strong inner feeling.
So, what is acting? Is it copying real behavior or creating something new? This is an important question in theater.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director has a special way to start rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find a reason to speak. For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they should breathe and remember a similar experience. They should not plan too much and trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theater should make you feel important. Going to see a live performance is special, and the staff should feel this too. It is not nice if the workers act like it is just a job. The theater should connect the actors and the audience. People in the audience should be able to see and hear everything clearly. The size of the theater is important. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theater is too big, it feels wrong because drama is about people. Many theaters built in the late 1800s were good because they made the stage feel close to the audience. 
When you go to the theater, you want to see something surprising and new. If not, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
Rock and roll music in the 1950s was very popular with young people. It was important because it changed the lives of many adults too. This music helped create new rock stars who were inspired by it. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, listened to a famous radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, hosted by Alan Freed. This show was very important for many future rock stars. 
Paul Simon was excited by the music he heard on Freed's show. He wanted to move from just listening to music to making his own music. 
**Snow**
I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was very strong, and it pushed me over as I tried to walk on the slippery ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole that was about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I did not see it. I climbed out of the hole, feeling scared and shaken. I wondered what would have happened if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. After an hour, I had only walked half a mile. I realized I had to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. These books talk a lot about how to collect data, but they often do not explain how to analyze the data. This makes it hard to understand how researchers do their work. To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to share their experiences. We wanted to help people understand how to analyze qualitative data, not just create a guidebook. This is not an easy task. We let our contributors share their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn’t remember much.
Many people think that learning on the internet and computers is good. But is it really a good way to learn? One writer talked about using an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something.
Research shows that learning happens best when children talk with teachers or parents. It is important to have conversations. Using new technology to teach our children is fine, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s movie-making was in Hollywood. People who lived there did not like this change. They thought Hollywood was becoming a place for rude people. But in the end, they accepted it because success is important. Success is measured by how much money a movie makes.
Hollywood has changed a lot in less than a hundred years. It went from a small village to a famous town, like New York or Paris. A long time ago, you would walk through orange trees to get to the store. But now, it is still a place where everyone talks about movies: how much money they made, who is dating whom, and who is working on what project. Many successful people want to work in Hollywood but live somewhere else. Still, it is the place where everyone in show business wants to be.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to make a lasting record of what they saw. With new tools, they could create images that were more real and detailed than paintings. This surprised other artists. Some critics said photography could not be art because it depended on machines. But photographers believed they had found a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use paint and pencils to show their view of the world.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older readers. During this time, children's publishing was mostly low-budget, which meant some work was not very good. However, the best artists always did their best work. 
The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place for research and finding interesting things. Some of the best illustrations will be shown to the public again, either through new books or exhibitions. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, a publisher will likely create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. When you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also showing your location to many people, not all of whom you might want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides.
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a lot of people. We might think this will bring us money or fame. But sometimes, we share too much and get lost in the online world. It can feel sad, but we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet before us.
In the early days of the web, some brave people explored it. They faced many problems, lost jobs, and learned hard lessons about sharing online. These early bloggers have stories that can help us today. 
In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. The web was new and mostly used by students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his experiences. He created a blog where he wrote about everything in his life. People were interested in his stories. 
But one day, his blog disappeared. Instead, there was a sad video called Dark Night. Hall had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner said he had to choose between the blog and their relationship. Hall felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker shared her blog with their bosses, and she lost her job because of it. This shows how what we say online can come back to affect us in real life. 
Armstrong was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but later she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps her family. 
Armstrong learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired. In rich and busy countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious are common problems. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have trouble sleeping. Some popular books in Britain have characters who cannot sleep or are about sleep research. 
A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. One researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they started to sleep about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.
In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise at airports disturbs sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They ask students to help with their research. Students are paid £5 an hour and change their sleeping habits based on instructions.
Dr. Louise Reyner helps the students feel comfortable. Some worry because they wear electrodes on their heads, thinking the researchers can see their dreams. But the researchers are more interested in how the body works. 
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Students come in the afternoon after not sleeping well. They drive while answering questions. The road ahead looks endless, and the sun is bright. The young men say they will not fall asleep. But Dr. Reyner has a video of one student trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink and nod off. Each time he wakes up, the car goes off the road. Drinking coffee can help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can keep you awake for half an hour. She suggests energy drinks and gum for alertness. 
Scientists know that humans sleep in a daily cycle, like other animals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We usually dream during light sleep. Our brain keeps our body still to prevent injuries while we dream. 
Scientists are sure that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they do not know why. Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. 
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British life from 1500 to 1850. People went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was good for thinking and remembering dreams. Poor people enjoyed this quiet time away from their busy lives. 
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people changed their sleep habits to sleep more efficiently. Later, during the industrial revolution, most people worked longer hours in lighted buildings. 
In some non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, then wake up again. For some tribes, noises and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep all night. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"We are talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the mountains and realized I did not belong there. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but that changed when I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt and carrying a bag. He looked at my new boots and then left without saying anything.
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. I was very good at it, but now I don’t race anymore. I wondered what I should do next. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when they stop racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they didn’t work out. I tried to be a commentator for races, but there were many other drivers who wanted the job. I also tried to sell classic cars, but that didn’t work either because nobody was buying them.
Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. Nobody wants to hear about how I almost became a champion. Even if I had won, people would only listen for a short time. Last year’s champion is not important anymore. I don’t want sympathy, but I do miss racing. I miss the excitement of driving fast cars and the attention from fans. 
Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked up at the blue sky and saw some small birds. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that I, a fake cowboy in fancy boots, still had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver for its nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, clean and safe places, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about how fast new buildings are being built, but many agree that new people and tourism have helped the city grow. 
Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a place where many journeys began. Now, it is still a gateway to many other places.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists, like me, are not very good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free. But I think it is because we always want our writing to be perfect. A true artist, who writes without thinking too much about it, does not have this problem. The best artists know how to use their words well. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about how to make them great; he just wrote.
**New Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A famous person, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day, and they do not need a celebrity. Last week, people waiting to enter the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. 
A customer said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud, while those who arrived late felt jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. Many people talked about it a lot before it was released. The release was delayed because the distributor was afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, the person the film is about, might do to them. Even though the reviews were very good, the film did not make a lot of money at first. It was television that helped people remember it later. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film was successful because he did not know what he could or could not do. He just made the film the way he wanted. He also had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to show a newspaper owner who was like Hearst but not exactly him, Welles knew he had a great chance to be both the director and the actor. He took this chance with a lot of energy.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had told her twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and that was a good place to do it. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she did not really hear him. Dermot asked her, ""Will you be okay? What will you do today?"" She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking that I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is almost wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You should enjoy yourself. If I am late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry."" She replied, ""That’s fine.""
**Title Race**
A recent study showed that job titles can cause problems at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees think job titles create divisions among workers. The survey also found that 70% of office workers would give up a pay rise for a better job title. This shows that people care a lot about how they are called at work. In the early 21st century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles people want focus on skills, like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator,"" but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Taking pictures was not just my job; it was my passion. I loved how light fell on different surfaces. A single photo could show the beauty of a place, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture. As long as I had film in my camera, I could keep trying. I had a simple rule: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for great shots.
Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. It became very popular, and many newspapers wanted to use it. It was a lucky moment. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped. That is why I was in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid. That felt good to me.
My assignment in Vienna happened by chance. I had taken photos for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had a good time taking pictures in London during all the seasons. But I knew that many of my best photos would not be used because it was just a picture book. 
After Christmas, I sent my winter photos from London. I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna. Instead of hiring someone new, they asked me to take his place. The publishers liked my work, and I was available. I was happy to go because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great.
They put me in a hotel called the Europa, in the center of the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy trip, and I didn’t take many photos. This time, I was alone in January, and I knew it would be different. When I arrived, I saw the beautiful light over the snowy roofs of the city. I was excited to take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to enjoy the city. The weather was cold, like the old buildings around me. I didn’t want to see what Rudi had done in the other seasons. This was going to be my Vienna, and I wanted to discover it myself.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time and looked carefully. The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz look beautiful and quiet. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one shot. The tall spire reached into the sky, but the building was very large at the bottom. I knew I would have to find a different way to capture it.
In that weather, the scene could still be magical. Photography has always felt magical to me. Even when I learned how it worked, I still felt its mystery. That morning at Stephansplatz, something surprising happened, but I was ready for it."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art**
Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a wonderful place. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves or talks about movement has been an important part of art in the twentieth century. 
The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied this topic for a long time. He has chosen to show the art without too much text. This way, visitors can enjoy the art and make their own discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is an artist whose work many people like. Some people enjoy his art because it is easy to understand. His paintings often show fun and relaxing moments, which help people escape from their daily lives. Others might like Hockney because of his fun personality and clever words in interviews. 
Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. They say he is too popular. But others believe that just because he is popular does not mean his art is not good. Hockney knows his own strengths and weaknesses. He does not say he is a great artist and believes that only time will tell how important his work is.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many art exhibitions, some great and some not so good. I often feel frustrated when exhibitions seem to push a certain idea or message. Sometimes this works, and we learn about new trends in art. But often, it feels forced or not genuine. 
As a curator, I wanted to create a different kind of show. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. The exhibition was called ""Window-shopping."" It was a collection of individual artworks that were connected only by being art. 
For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. In another piece, Matthew Crawley used a video camera and broke it while filming. These artworks did not fit into a specific theme, but they worked well together. They did not get in each other’s way and, I hope, they helped each other shine.
**Art History**
Many people who love paintings are sometimes afraid to think too much about them. They worry that thinking will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus more on theory than on the beauty of art. This can take away from the pleasure of looking at art and the joy of creating it. 
Understanding art does not mean we cannot enjoy it. In fact, knowing more about what we see can make it even more enjoyable. Our feelings about art are also influenced by the society we live in. What we like is not just about our personal taste but also about the values of our culture. 
While it is important to enjoy art, it is also valuable to think about it. The idea that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an old belief. Today, we can appreciate both the feelings art gives us and the thoughts it inspires."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age became interested in metals. While sitting by a river and waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone. This stone was not like other stones; it was beautiful. This is how gold may have come into the lives of these early people. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it quickly became very popular. Copper might have also been found by chance. When people saw how useful copper tools were, they started to look for copper and ways to get it from the ground. This is how metalworking began for our ancestors.
**St Ives**  
It was quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, cobbled street to the town center. The strong wind made it hard to walk, and we tried to avoid the cold waves that crashed over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed tight. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The dark clouds made visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seem like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is already gone. The people who lived in times of peace and times of trouble are no longer here. We cannot know exactly why they moved or settled in certain places. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on people from the past. We cannot go back in time and see what happened. However, we can use computer modelling to recreate old landscapes and environments. We can create virtual communities that act a little like real people. We can set rules and make social groups. Then, we can change things, like making it rain less or increasing the population, and see how these digital people react."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the main male monkey saw a strange male monkey nearby. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he did, the main male might lose his place as the leader. To keep the stranger away, the main male made an alarm call that sounds like a warning for a leopard. When the strange monkey heard this, he ran back to the trees. The main male did this every time the stranger came close. 
But then, the main male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself. 
**What Cats Catch**
In a village in England called Felmersham, people counted what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year! But this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in the village. 
The important question is whether the bird population can survive. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. So, the cat population is not destroying the birds in Britain.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly. They make sad sounds as they walk to the water. They stand at the edge for a long time, tired, until the leader goes into the water. 
Once in the water, they relax and forget their purpose. They stay there for a while, making low sounds. When they finally swim away, they look tired, as if they are drowning. They spend the day in the reeds, eating the green plants they can reach.
**Picasso, Pablo**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish while he was in a fishing town called Royan. The painting shows a fish market with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive, even though they are on the market. 
The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used a flat style with overlapping shapes. The colors are calm, making it feel like an underwater scene. But there is also a feeling of danger, as the fish seem to be fighting the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling of tension."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many parts of human life. It helps us see moments in time and understand both big and small things. Photography gives us images from faraway places, different parts of space, and shows us the problems of modern life. It is an important way to express what it means to be human.
However, people have been making pictures for much longer. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We are not sure why these early paintings were made. They might have shown hunting events, been used for magic to help with hunting, served as religious symbols, or just made homes more colorful. Pictures have always been a part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have asked how accurate pictures are and what they mean in society. Many believe that ""seeing is believing,"" which gives pictures special importance. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true record of what we see. The camera works like our eyes and can create fixed images that look very real.
Photography was seen as a big achievement. It could capture images that artists had worked hard to create. Some thought that everyone could easily understand photographs, making it a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even a very isolated person could understand a photo of the sky.
But as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we need to think about how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by culture like language? Do we take for granted how photographs show reality? People often believe photographs are very convincing, making it hard to see the difference between what we see and what is in the photo.
Since photography was invented in 1839, it has changed a lot. At first, it was a way to keep records, but now it is more than that. Photographs have become historical documents that tell us about the people and society that made them. 
I want to show that the camera is not just a tool that records events. Photography can also inspire social and political change. For example, the changes during the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century were connected to new ways of showing images. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture we have today, while also showing the tough realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry is not easy. It can be fun, but it can also be hard. If you want to write poetry, the best way to learn is to read a lot and write a lot. Let your imagination go free. Some people need to feel safe in their lives to write poems, while others write when they are sad. Some people write poems on a schedule, and others wait for a special moment to inspire them. All of these ways are okay as long as you find your own style. 
It is important to listen to your inner voice and let it grow. With time, your voice will become strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you should not have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used when they help the story. A memory can help explain what is happening in the story, but it should not slow down the action. 
Dialogue, or conversation between characters, is very helpful. It can show different sides of a story quickly. Too many words can make a short story boring, but being too short is not good either. A short story should have conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must count.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. When you play chess, you may not know what will happen next, but you make moves anyway. As you play more, you start to see the whole game and understand the patterns. 
In screenplay writing, the more you practice, the better you understand how to create a good story.
**Looking at Writing**
People naturally learn to speak, but writing is different. Charles Darwin said that language is a human instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons, but writing systems were created only in a few advanced societies. 
Many children today still struggle to read and write. A group of children is not likely to invent a writing system on their own. Children are good at listening and speaking, but learning to write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a book with so much doubt. I call it a novel, but I am not sure if that is the right word. I do not have a big story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about his life in between our meetings. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps and make it more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write what I know.
To protect the people in this story, I have given them made-up names, and I have tried to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When he dies, he might not leave any mark on the world, like a stone thrown into a river. If my book is read, it will be read for its own interest. But maybe the way he lives and his special character will influence others, and after he is gone, people will realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book.
I think my book will help those who write about my friend. I do not say that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I did not take notes, but I remember well what matters to me. I have put these conversations in my own words, but I believe they show what was said. I mentioned before that I have not made anything up, but I have taken the same freedom that historians take. I have imagined what my characters might have said to make the story more lively. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to do this to make it interesting. Smart readers will see where I have done this, and they can choose to ignore it.
Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It is hard to really know people, and I think you can only truly know those from your own country. People are shaped by where they were born, the homes they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, and the books they read. You cannot understand these things just by hearing about them; you must live them. Because you cannot know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about my own people before, and if I have written about others in short stories, it is easier because you can give broad ideas and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not pretend that my characters see themselves the same way; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At different times in history, people may find the world of literature confusing. However, later on, it is easier to see which writers and styles are important. Right now, there are many different types of poetry and ways to write and share it. There are two main groups of poets: 
1. **Literary Poets**: These poets write poems to be read on the page. They want their work to be printed in books and magazines.
2. **Popular Poets**: These poets like to perform their poems in front of an audience. They often read their work at events and festivals.
Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common. Small groups in towns hold readings in local halls or homes. Schools invite poets to read to students, and arts festivals often include poetry readings by famous poets.
For popular poets, performing is very important. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand, so people can enjoy them right away. However, for literary poets, it can be harder. Their poems are often more complex and may not be appreciated by people who are hearing them for the first time. 
Sometimes, literary poets might choose to read their easiest poems instead of their best work. This can be a problem because it does not show their true talent. 
Listening to poetry readings is not the same as reading poems on the page, but it can be fun and helpful. Hearing poets read their work can help the audience understand the poems better. It is good for listeners to have the text in front of them or to know the poems before the reading.
One good reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes mixed with music, is that they help people enjoy poetry. This way, more people can see poetry as something fun and not just for a few special people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians often use oral history, which means they listen to people's stories about the past. However, this can be difficult. When someone talks about their past, their memories can be influenced by the person asking questions. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers things. The way the historian thinks about the past can also affect the stories they hear. This means historians help create new evidence. But even the person telling the story is not always completely connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with things they learned from other places, like TV or books. Sometimes, they remember the past with feelings of sadness or happiness that come from later experiences. These feelings can make their stories seem more real, but they might not reflect what really happened.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles help animals behave. The whole animal approach looks at how animals act in their natural environment. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually study a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study animals in the wild and how they behave naturally. Both groups are starting to work together more. Physiologists believe their methods are very important, but understanding behavior also needs to be studied at a different level. For example, if we only looked at how nerve cells work, we would miss the bigger picture of how animals behave, like how birds build nests. 
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time have two tasks. They need to learn about the subject and also understand how to study it. This means they must know both the facts in textbooks and the methods used to gather this knowledge. These two parts are connected. We all have experiences in social life, so it may seem like social sciences are just common sense. However, each social science looks at different parts of society and uses special methods and ideas. These ideas help social scientists understand more than just everyday thinking and make each discipline unique.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He also used Greek words for some of these ideas. He did not mention utility or function at first, but he later talked about how to design buildings for different purposes. At the start, the focus was on beauty and art in architecture. The history of classical architecture is complicated. Before the grand buildings, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy. These simple structures did not meet Vitruvius' artistic ideas, but they were important for later designs. Even though classical temples look complex, they are based on the simple idea of a single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the train tracks, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air. This was the only mistake she made. After driving, they would smell the gasworks. Chen was actually happy about what his wife was doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Chen should have been upset, but he was excited to make plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month. This day was usually quiet, so they would leave early in the morning and come back by noon. This way, they would not lose any customers. Lily would practice driving around the gardens before the trip. Mui, even though she was worried, bought a road map. She got a ten percent discount, which made Chen happy, but Lily felt a bit insulted because Mui did not trust her to find the way.
After leaving home, they quickly saw the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to agree. On the road, Lily passed a few slow cars with great skill. Chen even clapped for her. After driving through the gasworks and past the lagoon with small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty seaside road. Lily parked in a small street near the sea that had many empty spaces. She was not sure about the parking signs, so she decided to pay for parking to avoid problems. 
Lily often looked at her sister's worried face in the mirror. She thought it was better not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were not happy with this. Lily told Chen he was ungrateful, and Mui said he was too proud. Chen took Man Kee, their son, to look at the grey sea. He held Man Kee close. Man Kee was warm and soft, and he reached out to touch his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son in a certain way. He wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers and to own many restaurants when he grew up.
As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a bit sad but also happy as he thought about Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship appeared in the sunlight on the water. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he could not see it, but then he found it. It was a small, old ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It is a special ship for us. It is small and old, but it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee did not want to let go of the telescope. When he finally did, the telescope stopped working, and all Lily could see was a blurry white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily could only see seagulls flying over the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I read somewhere that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear night. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket off the wall. As soon as it was free, I fell into the well. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I hit my head and saw strange lights. At first, I was confused, then scared, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say.
You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I wanted to shout back, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I stopped. I lay still and peeked at you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge. I landed on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows. My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming, and my father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked.
I felt a rush of excitement, but then I saw the drops of water I had left from the well. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. There was a little pool of water at my feet. I looked back at my father, who was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. My mother was screaming loudly now, and it scared me. What should I do? I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. I felt like I was in big trouble.
I thought of a plan. I took a deep breath and came out of my hiding place. I called out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit and then fell on the stones. I sat up, feeling comforted in my mother’s arms. I said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat and that I crawled through it to get out. I thought I was almost safe until my father came and asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. He looked at me closely. I said the tunnel had fallen in after me and that the well was dangerous. I had barely escaped with my life.
When I looked into my father’s eyes, it felt like he was seeing me for the first time. I felt scared. He said, “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” and walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad face. He seemed to understand my lie and worried about me. His look made me feel even worse than my father’s words. I realized that my actions had consequences, and I felt very ashamed."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan is a widow with grown children. She is leaving her family home. A van with the words ""Removers of Distinction"" is taking her things away. Fred, the removal man, is carefully packing her belongings. He is big and strong, but he is gentle with the fragile items. Susan's house is beautiful. It has four floors and looks over a small harbor. Many memories are in this house, especially of her children growing up.
When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five years old, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is an adult and is helping her move. He is making sure she does not forget about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very bossy and wants to take care of the piano because it is special.
Fred notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that some people cry when they move. They are happy while packing, but when they see the empty rooms, they get sad. Susan understands this feeling. She thinks she should have told the movers about the piano before they started.
The piano is in the best room of the house. They will move it last. Sitting on the stairs, Susan remembers the day they brought the piano into the house. It was a big problem because it got stuck on the stairs. The movers worked hard for two hours to get it inside. Robert watched with excitement, and Francesca cried, ""We can't live without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it in, and her late husband, Peter, helped solve the problem. They took out a window and used a crane to lift the piano inside. The children were so happy to see it.
Now, Susan thinks about how her children are busy and do not come home often. She is also having trouble moving around the house. She worries about the piano and the stairs. Fred asks if she is okay. She feels nervous as she watches the movers. Robert and Francesca are there too, watching quietly.
Suddenly, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is careful with it. They bring it outside and put it down by the van. Robert laughs, and soon everyone is laughing together. They feel relieved that the move is almost over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan realizes that she is not crying; she is laughing with her children."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just fun?**
When the Internet started, one important idea was that everyone could share their thoughts. In theory, anyone could write and publish anything online. At first, it was not easy for everyone because some technical skills were needed. But there was one area that became open to many people: book reviews.
Amazon.com was the first popular online bookstore. Here, anyone could write a review of a book. Amazon allowed anyone to say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a great idea because it let readers see what others thought about a book, not just what the publisher said or what professional critics wrote.
Amazon had many customers and many reviews because it was the biggest online bookstore. But this also led to some problems. Many reviews were written every day, and Amazon could not check them all. They had a team that looked for bad reviews, like those with only one word or personal attacks on authors. But many reviewers were anonymous, so it was hard to catch all the bad ones.
For example, some authors wrote good reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first book. He wrote some good reviews under a fake name to make his book look better. This worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed his fake reviews.
Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link. Most authors wrote nice messages asking readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even gave their email addresses for readers to contact them. However, Amazon did not always check if the comments were really from the authors, except for famous authors.
Sometimes, readers wrote angry reviews. For example, when James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team came out, some people mentioned in the book were upset and wrote many bad reviews. These reviews disappeared after a few days. But Amazon thought it was good that so many people were writing reviews.
Amazon wanted reviews to be about the books, not just chatting. They paid special attention to popular books to make sure the reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on pages for less popular books.
One classic children's book, ""The Story about Ping,"" inspired some funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a computer term. One long review compared the book's story to how the Internet works. But most reviews were serious, and they helped other readers know if a book was worth buying.
The writer George Orwell once said that writing too many reviews was hard because he had to pretend to feel something about books he did not care about. This shows that letting everyone write reviews is a good thing."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people often think that artists must go against the art of their time. We like to say that art is special, new, and sometimes shocking. We feel proud to admire artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. But when we look at art today, we often say that some artists go too far and that their work is not really art. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be confusing. We forget that today’s art still has old ideas and methods.
In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and art was part of everyday life. Now, we let artists work alone and sometimes get upset if they try to connect with us.
**A Situation to Think About**
I want to describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and says there are many types. Then, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas and write the text on it in simple black letters. My question is: is this finished piece a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is a rule that artists should stick to one style if it is successful. Collectors want artists to keep making the same type of art. If an artist tries something new, people often feel disappointed. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully changed their style. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. He is moving from still life paintings to paintings about the London Underground. He has created an exhibition called Underground Encounters, which shows 40 paintings and drawings of this unique underground world.
**A Story from an Island**
I have come to this island with a few books. I say ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a lonely place. I am here to heal myself. Besides an old woman who comes to clean, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories. I talked about how art seems useless, but it also brings comfort. Through art, we can change reality and find meaning. For artists, art helps us deal with the pain of everyday life. It allows us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from my fancy girls' school. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I won a prize for Latin and another prize for my end-of-school exams. He talked a lot with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already knew what he was thinking because he was quiet. My dad usually talks a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was going to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I said. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you like performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, trying to stay calm, ""I feel like you won't want to join the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to do this.""
The problem was that, like many kids in family businesses, I felt trapped by what my family expected. I saw many jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore them. But I also didn't want to upset my dad. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the skills - the brains, the courage, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him because he didn't have a mother. I loved Maurice, and it was not hard to take care of him.
Because the business was successful, we lived well - in a big house in London, went to nice schools, wore good clothes, and went to parties and shows. My father knew many important people - politicians, actors, and businesspeople - and our house was always full of interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making big decisions right now, especially since my father would be upset if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us.
So, I helped out during my last term at school and during university breaks, but only a few times a year and with easier tasks. I became a smart student, had a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a special black dress for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. I had only a few weeks left. My teacher said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew if I focused, I could do it.
Then my father told me he needed me to do one last important job for the family business. He said it was the most important work they had ever done, and it would be worth my time.
""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon, and I need to focus on that. It's really important, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could see that my father didn't understand how much pressure I was under. He would think that if I said no, I was betraying him. As he explained the job, I saw how focused and determined he was. He was very good at his work, and I admired that in him. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. They could only afford the house by being very careful with their money, and maybe it was better not to buy it at all. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had been doing well at work, and Lois returned to her job after having the twins. She even got a raise, making thirty-five thousand a year. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family. They needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a cheaper area of London, but Lois wanted to live in a nicer place. 
Lois thought one of them should save money by using public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the tube. The crowded ride made him feel unhappy and jealous. He remembered his grandfather's house, where he felt safe and cared for as a child. His grandmother always made sure his grandfather had peace after a long day at work. 
Lois had made it clear that her job was just as important as Simon's. They both needed their salaries to pay for the house and their lifestyle. Now, they were worried about a woman named Venetia. She had come to their office upset and angry. Simon wished he had left his room earlier to avoid her. He remembered her accusations about a case he worked on years ago. She said a man named Brian Cartwright claimed Simon knew he had bribed the jury but did nothing about it. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty. 
He could see that Venetia did not believe him. He wished he had said something different to defend himself. He felt ashamed and scared, remembering the punishments he faced as a child. He looked into Venetia's eyes and saw her disbelief. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. He was worried that if people heard about this, it could ruin his career."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be alone. I wanted to be around people who did not care about broken houses or messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens can be loved. I usually stay inside to forget about summer, but tonight I am watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I have cut back some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are a bit scratched.
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window. She is a writer and I sometimes help her with her work because I am an English teacher. I have her latest story with me. ""How is your writing going, Jaz?"" I ask. She complains about how people always ask her about her work. ""I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down,"" she says. I don’t want her in the garden because it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door and comes in. 
""You're on holiday now,"" she says, sitting in my chair. ""I should have become a teacher. Writers don’t have holidays."" She asks me about my plans for the break. I feel worried about having empty days with nothing to do. ""I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?"" I ask. ""Of course,"" Jaz replies, knowing she will be around.
""I’ll stay with my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun. We have been friends since we were kids,"" I say, even though it is not true. Jaz asks about her story, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans,"" which I have not read much of. I tell her I like the title. I think red vans can be cruel because they bring gifts to other houses but not to hers. I decide to give her some advice. ""Try writing about nice people for a change,"" I say. She gets upset and tells me to get a life. 
I tell her I keep a journal where I write something good about each day. She laughs at me. ""Get a life, Ann,"" she says. I do have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we go back inside, I feel calm in my kitchen. But then I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who once winked at us and said, ""I've had my moments."" We all laughed."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage means the connection people have with their past. We often feel close to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about our past helps us understand our future. Heritage is important because it gives us a sense of belonging and identity. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit our culture from previous generations. Some parts of our national heritage may not be perfect, but they are still a part of us. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our well-being. It influences our customs and culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these stories have been lost. Now, we can learn about our past through places and buildings. It is very important to protect these places to remember our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I once started writing a novel called *Waterland*. I chose to write about a place in England called the Fens. At first, I thought the Fens were flat and empty, but I learned they are actually very interesting and unique. Many people in England find the Fens strange, even though they are in the middle of the country. The Fens are both empty and full of life, and they are both farmed and wild. I have not visited some places in the Fens, but as a writer, I like to imagine what they are like. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy for everyone to see and understand. In the past, museums just put items in display cases with long descriptions. Now, museums should create exciting displays that attract visitors and make them feel something. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide boxes of objects for teachers or materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums show real items from history, not copies. This is their strength and what makes them different from other places like theme parks or books. Museums that create engaging displays and programs will find that they can work with technology to help people appreciate real history.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to keep things from the past is not new, but changes in our towns happen very quickly now. This can make some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about how towns are changing. People who have lived through big events, like wars, often want to keep things stable. If we need to preserve our history, planners should consider this. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, like our population and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask people on the street to name a scientist, many will say Albert Einstein. His picture is used to sell many things, like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complicated ideas called 'relativity'. These ideas are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that do not match our everyday experiences. 
Einstein was part of a big change in science that started in the 20th century. Scientists wanted to understand the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces work together. Einstein made important contributions by looking closely at basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists like Isaac Newton thought that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but can change.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust books that won awards because we thought they would be boring. Our mother did not like this attitude, but our father would give us small coins for every chapter we read to encourage us. He also gave us some special books for Christmas and birthdays, marked with ""This Book is NOT Literature."" We thought many of these were for boys, but he did help us read some good stories and even a famous book of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the beginning of human language is a secret and wonderful thing. This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans who faced dangerous animals made desperate noises, and some words today still remind us of this, like ""malaria,"" which means ""fever,"" and the Latin word ""mors,"" which means ""death."" 
Many people avoided talking about how language started because they thought it was silly. But now, studying the origin and development of language is very important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech to connect with each other and to gain power. Sharing information was probably not the main reason for language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke thought. He believed language was mainly for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"**Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and strict rules about how long they can be. When they are published, they are only in the newspaper for a short time, like a day or a week, and sometimes a month.
People often think that writing reviews is not very important. Many believe that writers only do it because they need money. Others think that writers cannot spend all their time on a serious book, so they write reviews instead. However, writing reviews is a skilled job. 
It is different to write a short review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for a journal. A review in a weekly magazine is usually about 1,500 words and has challenges from both short and long reviews. 
Reviewers must think about who will read their work. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed review. Reviewers also need to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that is easy for smart people to understand.
Most reviewers also write other things besides reviews. For example, the American writer John Updike does not think much of criticism, but he still writes reviews while he writes his novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with humble titles.
Some people think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long. But if they can, they should be allowed to keep their work and feel proud of it, especially if they think some of their best writing is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work too. 
Most of my work is academic, and my serious books are for professors. In English-speaking countries, it is common for the same people to write reviews and study literature. The old days when professors were criticized for writing reviews are gone. Now, there are many reviews, and almost everyone can write one. 
I believe this is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them stay connected to the public. They need to remember to write in a way that everyone can understand, not just other professors. 
In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his flat. When he walked in, he felt a quick sense of ownership. Even after three years, he sometimes felt this way when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he was always excited to come back, wondering what it had been doing while he was away. His flat felt like a welcome place for him, a space where he could be himself. 
He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, looking either clean or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He became frustrated that it didn’t change. 
There were always some letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were not broken and that nothing bad had happened to his things. He often looked forward to his quiet evenings at home after a long day at his office. 
On the bus ride home, he felt more like himself again. But once he was home, he didn’t want to be alone anymore, even though he thought he did. At his desk, he wanted to be alone with his things, but when he got home, he felt empty. He worried that his job was changing him and taking him away from who he really was. 
He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt lost. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and thought he could change his life. But he had been so eager to find something that he just went along with what others were doing. 
After university, he tried to make a plan for his life, but he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward. He went to one job interview and didn’t think much about the job itself. He was happy to have a nice chat with Neil, his future boss, and didn’t think about what working there would be like. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was going to the racecourse, I pushed my way through the crowd to find a good spot. They had made a special area for the race. It was not like a big racecourse, but people were standing on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few goats in order, which is not easy because goats can eat almost anything!
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we could not find a place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the flashlight batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. A little later, Lesley saw a flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we could not see what was happening. We kept moving on.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and important shareholders. How can I get better at this and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your passion and enthusiasm during the presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask your colleagues what tough questions the audience might ask. You should also start with something everyone can relate to and then lead to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be done quickly. They need their own time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush when making mayonnaise and add the oil too fast, it will not work. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very fast, while others take time—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. 
Some things can be done faster, like solving puzzles or doing math. But other things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they can break, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line. Saying ""Think fast; we need results"" can be silly or unhelpful, just like trying to sleep less to save time. We learn and think in many ways, and these ways work at different speeds for different tasks.
There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is very fast. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, if my motorbike slips on a wet road, my body knows what to do right away. This fast reaction is called our ""wits."" 
The second speed is thinking. This is when we figure things out, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic fixing a car or a student working on homework uses this kind of thinking. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and more relaxed. It is not always clear or direct. In this mode, we think slowly and dreamily. For example, when we sit by the sea and listen to the waves, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal. This slow thinking is just as important as fast thinking. 
Taking time to think slowly is necessary, especially when life gets busy. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Recent studies show that slow thinking helps us understand complicated situations. Fast thinking works well for simple problems. But when things are unclear or complex, we need to take our time. 
For example, if we are unsure about how to manage a difficult team at work or if we should change jobs, it is better to sit and think than to rush for answers. This slow thinking is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have always understood that slow thinking can be valuable. Scientists are now studying these slower ways of thinking and finding that they can help us solve many important problems if we give them time."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly place with many supplies, but it is very isolated. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, and weather experts. We all work together as a close community. My French is just enough to communicate, but I cannot have fun conversations. I miss the small details in the language, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a little scared of mealtimes. I would wait and worry about which table to sit at. I felt nervous when I spoke, and I felt like I was back in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think my occasional sadness is not about being alone or not talking, but because I have lost the confidence I used to have when I could talk easily.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he did not pay attention to me. He remembered faces, though. When I saw him, he would shake my hand nicely but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he would not notice me. Then, I became successful as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to like me more. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, I had many new friends because of my success, and I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock said he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience. He believed that people react to the film itself, no matter where they come from. So, if a film is made well, people in Japan should scream at the same time as people in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a smart man and a great filmmaker who liked to hear the audience scream. He did not think about deep ideas or complicated meanings. He focused on the film itself and how it could affect the audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good, and there were few practical guides. Now, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available. Computers and calculators have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 
However, some things have gotten worse. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, unlike 50 years ago when it was easier to see stars in cities. During the day, the sky is often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and make it hard to see the sun or stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices in life. People have many options for products and services. This can be overwhelming. Technology makes things change quickly, and new products come out all the time. This can make people feel tired and disconnected from life. 
Having more choices can lead to more stress and less time. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity,"" which means finding simple things that make life meaningful. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many products and options available.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family stays for two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. We do not want anything to change this tradition. 
The guests at McAndrews Hotel are often old-fashioned and a bit different. I do not like the rude behavior of some shop assistants today. I also do not enjoy when waiters act too friendly. I know many of the other guests because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them in the hotel, we usually just say hello and do not talk much. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**  
A great show of Shakespeare's play Othello is now in London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show started last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello, and I was wrong about his acting. I still believe that Othello and Desdemona should have an age difference, but I take back my words about Mr. Fearon's great performance. The whole cast is wonderful. Some memorable scenes are when Cassio plays games with other young officers, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The pace and tension in the play are amazing. Don’t miss this show!
**Lake Vostok**  
In Antarctica, there is very little life. On the edges, you can see penguins, seals, and birds. But in the middle, there is a huge lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been cut off from air and sunlight for about 25 million years. Scientists are excited to explore this hidden lake and find out what strange life might be there. For two years, researchers from around the world have been trying to learn the secrets of Lake Vostok. If they succeed, we will see many discoveries in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. They often say it is ""because it's there."" We know that they want to learn about everything, from tiny atoms to big black holes. But these scientists want to understand why we want to know these things. They wonder why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than argue about why we want to know. Science is a tool, and we should decide how and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**  
Food is very important in our lives. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special occasions or fancy dishes, but that is not true. You can make a tasty soup by just putting chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and some herbs in water. This is much better than buying soup in a packet or a can. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate dessert full of chemicals, you can make a delicious treat in just five minutes that everyone will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important for our happiness, which is why we celebrate special events like birthdays and anniversaries with food. No one would want to have fast food at a wedding or an important party!
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were sticking out of drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he could organize them. He also had a lot of papers because he owned an apartment building. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She always arrived exactly on time. He wondered how she would feel about the mess. She might think someone had made a mess in his office. Alistair could pretend to be surprised when he walked in after her. His cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, had come while he was trying to clean the floor. He smiled at her, hoping she would help, but she looked unhappy and went into her own area, leaving him to deal with the mess.
**Karen**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She created her own story about strength and difference. One important moment in her life was when she was twelve years old. Her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the doctor told her she was okay. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother, she felt grateful and knew she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was happy and sad as she walked back to her work on the village green. She was excited to learn something new in her small community, but she was also sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years and always cared for her when she was sick. She appreciated how he made her feel like he had time to listen to her problems. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to his patients, and in return, they were very loyal and cared for him deeply."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. But she also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna plays the piano very well. She can play many styles of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. 
At one concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised her, but she thought it was funny. She played it, and the boy was happy. Joanna cares a lot about how children learn music. She has written a piano book for kids called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. 
Even though she has a lot of work, she wants to help children learn music. She believes that the first lessons are very important. Many people think only about the best musicians, but Joanna thinks everyone should be able to enjoy music. 
When she was younger, Joanna taught many beginners how to play the piano. She also saw many children come to her home to learn music from her mother. She wants to make music fun for everyone, not just for those who are very talented. 
Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time and sometimes give up. Joanna worries that some parents push their children too hard to be like the stars they see on TV. She believes music should be fun, not just about winning or being the best.
Joanna's books are colorful and fun. They have stories and music to make learning easier. She wants children to enjoy playing the piano. She believes it is important for kids to practice, but she understands that it can be hard. 
Joanna thinks that practice is very important for learning music. She suggests that children should have clear goals when they practice. It is also good to mix easy songs with harder ones. Most importantly, she wants children to have fun while they learn."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is hard to do. When I look back at my school essays that I wrote by hand, I see that I made very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is slow and makes me think more. When I write by hand, I take my time and write carefully. 
Using a computer is different. It is easy to change things, so people often do not pay attention to their writing. Many writers spend just as much time fixing their work on a computer as they did writing it by hand. Also, emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. Many people now send love letters by email, which is good. At least they are writing in English and using some grammar. But words on a screen can feel boring. People often do not think about their words and can make their meaning unclear. Writing quickly on a computer can make the writing less special than handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not very nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully gave him the disc. ""It’s amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and he pressed a button. A small drawer opened, and he put the disc inside. He pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, looking surprised. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thought for a moment. ""I don’t know. I guess you could make both sides play and double the music..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He pointed to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let’s get you sitting in the best place for the sound, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a question he could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were invented after cigarette lighters, we would think lighters were amazing. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing. They think it is almost finished. But it takes a long time for people to change how they think. Some people believe that reading on a screen is better, but many do not enjoy reading long texts on a screen. Most people prefer to read books. 
Some people say that reading on a computer helps us think in new ways. But many books have always been read in different ways. For example, people do not always read religious texts or dictionaries from start to finish. The problem with computers is that they do not encourage people to read everything carefully.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything was neat. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered from the auction. Neat file holders were in their places. Twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen was trying to close the filing cabinet and then looked at him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much,"" she said. 
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he replied, admiring the room and its old furniture. He did not think about computers or any machines in the room. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had talked about this many times over the two years he had known her. She could not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. She could use any software and make it do amazing things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She forgot things because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He learned that staying away only caused more problems. 
He thought about how he had changed from a respected advisor who met authors for lunch to someone who was always busy and had no place to park at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one.
Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, but he was very difficult to work with. Lancelot quickly read the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. It was clear that Ian's manuscript would not be ready soon. The synopsis was not as brilliant as people said it would be, and it felt like Ian had lost his passion for the book.
Lancelot remembered a famous author who had published an incomplete book after his death. That author had been paid little by little for each chapter. But Ian had received a lot of money upfront, which was not how things should work. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising writer in Cambridge. His friends wanted to take over British theater, and they did. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he had met them.
For some reason, Ian's creative talent stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian became harder to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but he still did not produce anything. At meetings, he was rude and critical of others' ideas. Ten years later, he was so unreliable that Lancelot thought ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,C2,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**
A good breakfast is very important, according to health experts. But in the past, breakfast was not common in England. You do not see many mentions of breakfast in old stories from medieval times. Sometimes, travelers ate a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become normal for everyone. Some writers say this happened because there was more food available. However, they did not think about other big changes in society. For example, new jobs meant that people had to work set hours. Many people started work very early in the morning. So, eating breakfast became necessary and was not just for rich people anymore."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences. They also think about social and cultural ideas. In this book, we will see how these things affect the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also look at how people see and react to these images. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they usually understand the photos on the page. But instead of just believing the photo, we can ask if it really shows what happened at that time. Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment in the photo important, or does it represent something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you need to focus only on your goal. Sports can be tough, and no one will do the work for you. You either succeed or fail. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport lets me shine as an individual, but it is also a team game, and I must balance both. This is like life – you can do well alone, but you must remember others are around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. But I also had to give up a lot to get these rewards.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened one night in California. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the beautiful singing kept me awake. As I listened to the bird's songs, I felt like I was in a special musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I thought about jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an amazing live performance. I enjoyed the different musical sounds until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always talked a lot about birds. They love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Is it trying to tell us something, or is it just stuck? Depending on how you see it, both could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, you can still see wrens in pictures and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about wrens are not as strong now, people still care about them. A place without wrens feels sad. 
This connection with birds comes from a time when people lived closely with nature. They learned to understand the importance of different animals. Over time, people's views about birds have changed. 
For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a helpful bird in London. It would take bread from children’s hands. But later, people thought of it as a pest and many were killed. Now, red kites are protected again and are seen as important birds in Britain. 
Our connection with birds goes back to when humans first appeared. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. 
Birds are important to us because they represent freedom and beauty. Some people think our feelings about birds are not needed anymore, but they are still a part of us. Losing this connection would be hard. 
Today, birds are also important for understanding the environment. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means we are losing not just birds, but also part of our culture. 
Certain birds, like the skylark and turtle dove, represent love and magic in stories and poems. When we lose these birds, we feel sad. But we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not in stories. 
Folklore, which includes stories and legends, is very important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that science cannot. They help us feel emotions that are hidden in our busy lives. 
Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be explained by science. Birds are fascinating, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their importance. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a long history, and its song makes us think about the future."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
A map shows how places and features on the earth are related to each other. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, people often talked about distance in time, like ""it takes so many hours to walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring distance helped people understand how easy it was to travel in different areas, but it did not give exact distances.
Direction is also important, but for many travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, exact directions were not always very important. Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not show true directions.
In the past, important landmarks were shown on maps with signs that could be realistic or simple. The way maps were made changed depending on their purpose and location. To understand old maps, it is important to know the specific way they were made.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is about making maps more accurate in showing distance and direction. Over time, cartographers used other sciences to help them. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, they started using compasses and tools to measure angles accurately.
As people explored the world more, they wanted better maps. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which helped improve maps of large areas. The needs of map users also changed. Soldiers needed accurate maps for battles, especially after new weapons were invented. This led to the creation of contour maps, which show the shape of the land.
Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work. Today, cartographers make maps for many different uses, like showing land use or climate. The importance of maps in many sciences has led to a new interest in cartography.
It is important to know that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times when map-making did not improve, and old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Since it is easy to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas.
Therefore, we should not always trust maps as the best evidence of what we know today. The many maps we have now are the result of a lot of hard work and thought. They are valuable records for studying human history. This is what makes learning about historical cartography interesting and important."
CPE_35,C2,"**Tim Rice**
I went into a young man's living room. It was a nice place, very different from the messy rooms where his family spent time. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from a cheap seat to a better one. This room had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had come across, and it showed that a teenager named Andrew Lloyd Webber had spent money on nice things like wine glasses and furniture. 
Andrew had a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history. He had nine months before starting school, and he wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. But my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested I try to be a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was happy to try. 
In just ten minutes, Andrew played me three of his songs on the piano. I could tell he was very talented. He played songs from shows he had written at school, and they reminded me of the best albums from my parents. He needed a new lyricist, and I didn’t have much to show him except for a song I had written that a small pop group had recorded. 
We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I knew I had met someone special who would be very successful. Even if we didn’t become famous composers, we could try to write songs for popular bands like the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. 
The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, I felt less sure about a life in show business with Andrew. I would still look for ads for groups needing a singer and write more songs, but I thought I would probably end up being a lawyer by twenty-five. My father thought I would stop liking pop music by twenty-one, which worried me. But I wanted to see Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. 
Andrew was interesting; he talked about good food and old buildings, and he supported a football team. He had been working on a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man who started orphanages. I didn’t find the story exciting, but Andrew believed in his music. I didn’t know much about musicals, but I was excited to help. 
I started working hard, especially on the funny songs. Andrew told me the story, played the music, and gave me some titles. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first lyrics for the musical. That day, I didn’t know it, but I was starting a new career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
You and I are part of a special group of living things. We can change how others think and feel by using words. Language is very important in our lives. It is hard to imagine life without talking. When people are together, they usually talk to each other. If someone is alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as a natural skill. Just like spiders know how to make webs, people know how to talk. No one teaches spiders how to spin webs, and they do not need special training to do it.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather are made by the air around us. They have a big effect on animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow. These jungles have many different kinds of plants and animals. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. The weather we see every day is caused by big air movements. The air is always moving because the Earth spins. The sun also helps create air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, my job was to serve drinks, but I also had to make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I had several days of training to learn how to make coffee. I learned how to clean and take care of the espresso machine. I also learned how to make a good cappuccino. By the end of the week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed. I thought I might have to go back to cleaning ashtrays. Luckily, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often not do well with shows about art? Painting and sculpture are good subjects for TV because the camera can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. But there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. 
A good example is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would show great artworks. Instead, it focused on how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as a dealer in metals and became known as a speculator. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this business. This adventurous culture fits well with a free global economy. 
However, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the prices of rare metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the prices of raw materials are going down. If we consider inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and something special to offer. To get around the islands of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go by yourself. 
Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm waters are also great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**
You can build your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by two engineers, James Marr and Ian McMillan. When you join a course, you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend of bike-building.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes. I went to see what was happening. There was a lot of energy and fun in the workshop.
Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes. Some companies, like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire, have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. However, many cyclists find these bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868. 
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a business that everyone could enjoy. They wanted to share the joy of making something special and sustainable. Now, the Bamboo Bike Club is more about community than just a business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a good price.
On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You start by gluing the bamboo tubes together to make the bike frame. They also use metal tubes for parts that need to be very strong, like the handlebars and wheel forks. 
James and Ian help everyone with their work. They check every cut and joint to make sure it is right. If someone has trouble, they will help. Many people in the course are engineers, but Ian says everyone makes mistakes sometimes. If you mess up, just try again with a new piece of bamboo.
On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. 
James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are very strong, just like metal bikes. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it. They use thicker bamboo and stronger bindings to make the bikes even better.
The bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They may not look as neat, but they are unique. James and Ian believe that the special look is important. I chose a frame that is comfortable to ride. When I tried James's bike, it felt light and smooth, even when I rode over bumps.
James says that some people enjoy building the bike, but the best part is riding it. The bamboo bikes are light and fun to ride. And the price? It is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend worked as an editor at Random House in New York. One day, she found a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the title was great and believed it would be a bestseller. She was right! Dr. Gray became very rich, and Dione started her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps men and women communicate better. It is very popular and is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry tries to help people improve their lives, but it also creates many new problems. In New York, many self-help books are published, but many more are not accepted because they are too similar or too specific. Editors are always looking for the next big book. They care more about how well a book can sell than how well it is written. Dione says that if someone has a catchy title, it is easier to sell the book.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an agreement between the writer and the reader that the truth will be told. However, this agreement is often broken. The writer may feel ashamed of some things and not want to share them. They might also think some details are not important. Sometimes, writers create stories that are not completely true but help explain their lives better. They may call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This can happen without the writer being dishonest.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
People who study detective stories say they show the problems of society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In these stories, a crime represents human feelings like greed or desire. Solving the crime helps bring order back to society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are often similar. The detective understands the criminal, and they have a strange connection. The detective is part of both worlds: he is too honest for the criminals and too shady for the law. His job can be confusing because he feels connected to both sides.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. He said that writing in a fancy place like that is hard. He believes that only scientists can write well about science because they understand it. If you do not know the science community, it is difficult to write about it. Gould also says that writers should not talk down to their readers. They can use simpler words, but they should not make the ideas too easy. If readers feel like they are being treated like children, they will not enjoy the writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers, it is very cold inside. This summer, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning because of the high temperatures. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic when it is quiet. This shows how people often use air-conditioning too much. It is now a big part of our lives, helping us control the temperature. However, many buildings could be cooler without so much air-conditioning. They could use sunlight and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas are simple but can really help reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that more people are looking at sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches got better, sundials became just decorations in gardens. Now, people are starting to appreciate them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I remember seeing china-painting at an arts and crafts show. Older women painted flowers on teacups with great skill. It was amazing to watch them. Their hands were steady, and the paint looked perfect. I wondered if anyone would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners be good at it? When I went to a class, I found out it was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, a beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that other people in the package were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian.
But something went wrong. At the travel agency or at the check-in desk, a mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. 
An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure did not say anything about an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived, Keith realized that this was what it was. 
It was close to midnight when they got off the coach. They were tired and did not feel like asking about the beds they were given. But the next morning, they found out they were supposed to stay in the hotel for their whole holiday. They were worried. 
The receptionist smiled and said, ""We have the lake and the water birds. You can take a boat to Interlaken."" Keith said, ""There has been a mistake. We were meant to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" The receptionist replied, ""I do not know that name. This is Switzerland."" 
Keith explained that an official said a coach would take them on. The receptionist said, ""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you want to change, it is too late."" 
Dawne said, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. A woman smiled at Keith and said, ""Some problem, have we?"" She was the same woman they saw at Gatwick. 
Dawne asked, ""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks? We are in the wrong hotel."" Keith added, ""We got into the wrong group. We told the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" Dawne said, ""We should have known when they weren't from Dover."" 
Keith was frustrated and wanted to talk. He said, ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" Mrs. Franks said, ""I counted you, but you didn’t see me. Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday has many different trips. There are villa holidays for young people and treks to Turkey."" 
She continued, ""All tickets and labels look the same, yellow with two red bands. If you followed others with the same label, you might end up in a wildlife park! But that could never happen."" 
Keith insisted, ""We are not meant to be in Switzerland."" Mrs. Franks said, ""Let’s see."" Then she walked away, leaving them there. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. 
Dawne whispered, ""She seems kind."" But Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane. 
An old man interrupted his thoughts and said, ""Nice to have young people here. My name is Nottage."" His wife said they had the best sleep because of the lakeside air. Dawne said, ""That’s nice."" 
Keith walked out of the hotel, and Dawne followed him. They did not say anything about the funny situation they were in. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they found themselves on a trip with older people when they wanted to escape from that. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to get him to come with them."
CPE_48,C2,"**He Was a People Person**
American business leaders are looking to Ernest Shackleton, a famous polar explorer, as a good example of management. Eluned Price reports.
Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. In America, people are just starting to learn about him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" but this is not completely true. Now, Americans are very interested in him. Many books and stories about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being made. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is also in the works.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They tell stories about his actions and find lessons in his leadership and communication skills. They even say they are ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, who used a reindeer sleeping bag and a blubber stove, is now a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at a New York firm, has looked up to Shackleton for many years. His firm helps with communication during business changes and crises. For example, they help when a factory has an explosion or when many workers must be let go. MacGregor believes that Shackleton is a good model for management because he was a strong leader and communicator. Shackleton knew what was important, especially when lives were at risk.
One important decision Shackleton made was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. He had to make this tough choice because they were running out of supplies and needed to return to their ship safely. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge.
In 1914, Shackleton's expedition became famous. His ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months and was eventually crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the diaries of the men, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. He planned carefully, kept his men informed, and listened to their ideas. He was flexible and willing to change plans if needed.
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs to be optimistic, strong, and patient. MacGregor says that in difficult times, it is hard to wait for things to get better, especially in America, where people want quick solutions. For example, if you invest money and make a mistake, it is better to wait and not sell right away, as this could lead to a big loss. Also, if a new product is not selling well, it is okay to stop selling it.
Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his gloves and said he would throw them overboard if Hurley did not wear them. During a previous expedition in 1905, Shackleton did something similar with a biscuit when they were very hungry. He said he would leave the biscuit in the snow because it was so valuable.
Caroline Alexander, who wrote about Shackleton's expedition, says that people today want to hear stories of heroism. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare now, and he represents the ideals that many people long for today."
CAE_15,C1,"
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists have studied how aye-ayes find insects. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University looked at two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might be.
Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with small holes. Some holes had food inside, and some were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, showing they did not need to see the holes to find the insects. They might have found the food by smell or sound, but tests showed they did not use these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked or when the insects were quiet.
So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they could feel the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. It seems to be using a method called echo-location, which means it listens for sounds that bounce back to find hollow spaces.
Some people think the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar, but there are also birds that look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is not just like a woodpecker; it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing, just like a squirrel's teeth. Recently, it was seen in the wild chewing through nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,C1,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Many of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Sometimes, diaries and family stories do not tell us everything. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down, but we do not do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but videos are still just images.
Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary people. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family and saw how much of the past was being forgotten.
""When I started, I did not take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have interesting stories to tell. They say they do it for their children or for the future, but they enjoy it too.""
People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I talked about my divorce, and it still hurts."" He wrote his story for his family, but he has not let his children read it yet. He wants to protect them from some painful details. He thinks they should read it after he is gone.
Hannah has noticed that many people are affected by their childhood. ""Many people repeat the same mistakes because of their parents,"" she says. ""They marry people their parents liked or choose the opposite to rebel."" 
Many people still feel sad about things that happened with their parents, even many years later. They try to impress parents who were never happy. Some people even want to say, ""I can't stand my mother.""
Hannah listens to people without judging them. ""I am not here to be nosy,"" she says. People sometimes share things and then worry if it should be in the book. But Hannah usually includes it. Most people want to be honest about their lives.
Hannah's books are not for everyone to read. They are personal stories. She believes we are losing touch with our past. Writing these stories helps people connect with their family history. 
Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story, organizing it well. The final book looks nice and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies costing £25 each. She gets about 10 requests each week, but the price stops many people from buying.
""I thought more people would want this service,"" she says. ""But the people I have worked with are often from wealthy families, like those who used to have their portraits painted."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has many copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over six hundred pieces in total. It is important to know that these sculptures are not real. They are copies made from the original sculptures, mostly made in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Museum has a special gallery with good natural light. The plaster copies are useful because they allow people to see many sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums across Europe. You can see many famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.
**B. Cambridge Darkroom**  
Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography. It has darkrooms for developing photos and a gallery that shows different photography exhibitions. We offer courses and workshops for everyone, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with special photographers. Members can use the darkrooms. We also have a program for young photographers aged 12 to 16 to help them improve their skills. We sell photography books and materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossils, rocks, and minerals from all over the world. It also has the oldest geological collection in Britain, started by Dr. John Woodward. This collection has nearly 10,000 rare items kept in old cabinets from the early 1700s. Adam Sedgwick was a professor of geology who added many items to the collection. The items are organized by age, so you can see how life on Earth has changed over time. The new Whewell Gallery shows beautiful minerals and gems, with labels that explain what they are and how they are used today.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The university has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos all over Great Britain. These photographs are interesting because they show the landscape and how it has changed from ancient times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. You cannot borrow the photographs, but you can buy copies, which usually take about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is one of the oldest and most unique tourist attractions in the world. Visitors can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing over one of the more than one hundred brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The centre makes resin copies to protect the original plates while allowing people to do brass rubbing. These brass plates were used as memorials and came from Germany to medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brass plates were destroyed during revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and you can see many examples at the Cambridge Centre."

A. **The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have enjoyed 35 years with small children. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This brings us close, especially now that they are older and I am more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have slapped my kids when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I always tried to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. If I chase them to ask why they haven’t called, it makes them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I will not do it to my children.
B. **The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, only about 25. I found the responsibilities hard, but they also kept me young. As they became teenagers, they showed me new things like music and fashion. This helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. But now, I can take them on holidays to nice places, and they enjoy being with my friends at parties and events. I think it is good that my job is interesting to them.
C. **The Politician**  
My first child was born just before I started my political career. My wife and I promised to spend time with our kids, but as I got busier, it became harder. I only go to meetings on weekends if my kids can come with me. This way, they see what I do and do not feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want our children to be part of our lives.
D. **The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I had to think a lot about being a father. I tried hard to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate said we were too relaxed with rules. I wish I had been stricter. I still worry about my daughters, no matter how old they are.

I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child?"" Having my daughter, Betty, made me think about who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but when I see her smile, all my irritation goes away. A baby's smile is very powerful."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science Flying in the Face of Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked like a normal aircraft from the outside. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964. It was a Boeing KC-135, which is based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and lights on the padded walls. Most of the seats were taken out, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.
For 12 months, these students had worked hard to join this special flight. The European Space Agency asked them to come up with creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The students with the best ideas won a spot on this amazing flight, which felt like a big roller-coaster ride.
For the next two hours, the plane would fly up and down like a bird. The pilot would turn off the engines at 3,000 meters, and the plane would go higher for a moment before falling back down. During this time, everything inside the plane would be weightless. The students would feel like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.
The plane took off smoothly, but soon the pilot made the plane climb steeply. The engines roared, and the students felt the blood rush from their heads. Then, the engines stopped, and they experienced weightlessness. For 20 seconds, they floated in the air, like they were on a trampoline. They could not tell which way was up or down. 
After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane up again. Gravity returned, but not as quickly as it left. Some students landed hard on the floor. They had 30 curves to go through, which gave them 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments. 
The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to help with this experiment. The German team looked at how metal joins are affected by weightlessness, which could help build future space stations. Another team from Utah State University tried to create solar sails from thin liquid films in microgravity. They believe these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.
After two hours of flying, the students felt excited, not sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees: My Experience in New Zealand**
Jonathon Porritt talks to Danny Danziger. Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology.""
I had a strange time in my life when I did not have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which was great because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there.
They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was good for planting trees. I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on farms, so I was excited about planting trees. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, my siblings and I had planted the whole 70 acres.
In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. It was strange to think of that time as happy because it rained almost every day we were planting. I remember every morning getting ready to plant. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then the rain would start. My clothes were still wet from the day before, and my hands were cold. 
In that first year, I worked with a man who knew how to plant trees. This was helpful because I had never done it seriously before. I had a planting bag around my neck to carry trees. When the bag was full, it was heavy, but when it got lighter, it was easier to work. 
The hardest part was making sure the lines were straight. You have to decide how far apart to plant the trees and then use poles to make straight lines. Once you are in line, you can plant all the way down and then come back. I enjoy hard work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, planting trees became easier. You learn a rhythm and use fewer movements to dig the hole and plant the tree.
While planting, I had a lot of thoughts about life and nature. Many of my ideas about the natural world started during that time. I have been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow. It feels good to see the trees I planted. I worry when I read news about storms or droughts in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.
In 1984, I took a break from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" there. There is a small cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote, and in the afternoons, I pruned the trees. The connection I have with that place is very strong. It is where I feel closest to the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Taking Care of Badger Cubs**
One day, I was surprised when one of my helpers brought me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset where we take care of orphaned animals. I heard strange noises from the box, so I looked inside. I saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. They had soft coats and looked up at me with their milky eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before.
Most badger cubs are born between January and March and live underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. These three cubs were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. Their mother was dead, but the cubs were alive. They were cold and scared. I took them to my kitchen to keep them warm. I named the two girls Primrose and Bluebell, and the boy Willow.
At first, I fed them with a syringe. I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to help them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around. They were happy with each other and a warm pad to cuddle.
Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was not as active, but he was still eating. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. It is important to feed animals slowly, or they can get sick. I felt sad about Willow, but I continued to care for the other two cubs.
Then, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, alone and hungry. I named him Willow II. He was younger than Primrose and Bluebell. Feeding him was hard. I had to move the bottle around to get him to drink. After a week, he learned to eat sausages, and soon he was ready for more food.
By five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, and nuts. Badgers usually eat a lot of earthworms, but it was a hot summer, and finding food was hard. By August, the cubs started to come out at night. They loved to play and chase each other in the orchard.
One night, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food, but badgers can be aggressive. We were told to protect our cubs, so we put metal over the gate to keep them safe. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help build a home for them.
With help from our son Daniel, we designed a new home for the badgers. It had tunnels and a special gate. Many people donated money and materials. Finally, the badgers moved into their new home. I watched them settle in and then left them alone.
Now, I don’t walk with them as much because they stay up late. Primrose has moved to another home, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before they run off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy."
CAE_67,C1,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But he also did important work by studying how compasses work. He used his sea trips on a warship called Paramore to find out about the ""variations of the compass."" These variations are now called ""declination."" Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley was one of only two men in England paid to do scientific research at that time. He planned to sail to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. However, his first trip ended early because the crew did not listen to him. Halley tried again and traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a map called ""New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans."" This map helped sailors for over a hundred years until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was in Antarctica for two years. He read about Halley's life and said, ""Halley led a remarkable life. He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also studied geophysics."" Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.
Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's journey will give him the recognition he deserves. His trip, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. He will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. The Earth's magnetic field is always changing, so these new measurements are important.
Dr. Clark explained, ""It is common to measure the size of the magnetic field but not the direction. You need to know true north to measure the direction."" On this trip, they will use satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the measurements. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his work will help fill in any gaps in the data.
Halley's journey was very important. It was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian to be a naval captain for this kind of work. 
Dr. Clark has the experience to make his trip successful. He spent two years in Antarctica and worked at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
When asked if he shares Halley's obsession with this work, Dr. Clark said, ""I am ready to give up my life for eight months to do this. Some people might think I'm obsessed, but I want to have a good reason to sail across the Atlantic again. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,C1,"**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful feathers to the hens. This behavior makes people think about a question that Charles Darwin wondered about: how can birds have such fancy feathers in a world where survival is tough? 
Darwin believed that animals change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that the strongest animals survive and have babies. But he also thought that the peacock's tail was not useful for survival. So, he suggested another idea called ""sexual selection."" This means that female birds choose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He believed that if hens liked the peacocks with the most beautiful tails, there must be a good reason for it. He thought that the tail was not just for show but showed something important about the male's ability to survive.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to find the answer. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. Marion Petrie and her team are studying two main questions: Do peahens really choose the males with the most beautiful tails? And do these peacocks have other good qualities, or is it just for show?
The scientists watch the peacocks and take pictures. They found that the hens do prefer the males with the most eye spots on their tails. The more eye spots a peacock has, the more mates he attracts. But they still need to find out if these beautiful males are better in other ways.
William Hamilton from Oxford University thinks that male birds with fancy feathers are healthier and have fewer parasites. This idea has been seen in other birds, but the scientists at Whipsnade have not yet checked the peacocks for parasites.
This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the babies of attractive peacocks with those of less attractive ones. She wants to see if the babies of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that the hens choose wisely.
There is also an interesting idea from a mathematician named R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will have long tails, and their daughters will like long tails too. This could lead to more and more peacocks with long tails over time. This idea also supports Darwin's thought that females might choose beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, called 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. 
In contrast, my boat is quiet and sits in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic for owning such a boat. Maybe I am, but I don’t think so. My boat uses the best parts of old boat design, but it also uses modern technology to make it easier to build.
However, modern technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real experiences of being at sea. These experiences are often what they want to find when they go sailing. I don’t think sailors should go back to suffering all the time. I like my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if everything is done for you? Dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.
Also, why should we change the steering position to a place that is less safe? This change makes the inside of the boat feel like a big house, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water.
When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to race around Britain for a TV show, the previous owner said it had comfort but no luxury. I learned he was right. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, and no electronics for navigation. But she was the easiest boat I ever sailed.
On land, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing her. I looked for a younger boat but couldn’t find one, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. 
The designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are good with computer design, but Irens first drew the boat on a paper napkin. Then he made a model, just like boat builders did in the past. We worked together to improve the design using a computer. The final design was perfect. 
The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and feels peaceful inside. This is because she was designed only as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. 
She is made from wood treated with special glue, so she does not take in water. This means she has the advantages of a fiberglass boat but still looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

Health farms and country hotels with spa services are very popular now. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started to join classes like yoga and body conditioning. The teachers were very good. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment made me feel like a new person. The staff were very friendly and professional. The place felt lively and positive. Henlow is planning to make some big changes this year, including a new swimming pool. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a quiet walk in the garden. I felt great and full of energy when I left. I want to visit again. This is a perfect place for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing feeling of this big house was clear as soon as I walked in. The Hall has a nice library and a lovely conservatory. There is a lot of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a health check, which includes checking your weight and blood pressure. They called us patients, which felt strange because I am healthy. However, they found a shoulder problem during my check, and I worked on it in group classes and private sessions. Each person gets a special diet to follow. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry and got a headache on the second day. My daily meals included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. Extra treatments cost more.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm, but it is a nice old manor with cozy fires and a big lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool to help you stay fit. You can choose a healthy diet if you want to lose weight. There is a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big draw is the sports injury clinic. I got advice for an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, but also relaxed. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests very well. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens in the 376-acre estate. Waldo's is a famous restaurant with amazing food. It took me a long time to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent some time in the gym to burn off some calories. I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty treatments if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is very delicious, but it is also very high in calories, which is not good if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep during the massage. I had the best sleep in years. The place is modern and well-organized, with nice rooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book treatments. They offer many services, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to mothers and daughters. I would love to take a break here every month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the last seven million years, humans and chimpanzees have changed very little. We are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very new. Our ability to create art and other things we think are special to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. 
Studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are also found in animals. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language with different sounds for different dangers, like leopards and snakes. This means that besides art, there are not many clear differences between humans and animals.
If human art comes from special genes, it is strange that our ancestors did not make art for almost seven million years. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we cannot find these because they do not last long. The first clear evidence of human art is from about 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
Some people say that human art is different from animal art in three ways: 
1. Human art is not made for a purpose.
2. Human art is made for beauty and pleasure.
3. Human art is learned, not instinctive.
Let’s look at these points. First, Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art does communicate ideas, it is not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, on the other hand, helps birds defend their territory or attract a mate.
The second point is that human art is made for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during mating season, so they might not sing just for pleasure. This makes human art seem unique.
The third point is that human art is learned. Different human groups have different art styles that they learn. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. But some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' song, even if they have never heard it before.
Human art changes quickly. For example, people can tell when a painting was made just by looking at it. In 1957, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy had an art show in London. Congo made many paintings and seemed to enjoy it. Their paintings sold well, which is something many human artists cannot do.
These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal behavior is not so clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not made for a specific purpose; they were created for the enjoyment of the painter. Some might say human art is different because it is meant to communicate, but even some famous human art was made just for the artist's own pleasure."
CAE_39,C1,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on Earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed this desert and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories had brave explorers with sunburnt skin and narrow eyes, looking into the distance on their journeys. Today, we do not see such people in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a group across the Taklamakan Desert. The name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while sitting in his family home. His team had four British people (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous for everyone.
This mixed group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun and to find out more about himself. ""I thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I wanted to see who I really was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I would not come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what would happen. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very good to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will wonder why he said the desert was ""kind."" The team faced many problems: sickness, extreme heat and cold, thirst, and losing some of their water. ""But,"" Blackmore said, ""when we were very tired and the camels had not had water for seven days, we found some. We did not have the famous sandstorms of the Taklamakan. And we did not feel the freezing cold that could have stopped us. But we still had many challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavy camels, which sometimes fell over onto us.""
""What pushed me to keep going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No planes flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely alone. I knew I could handle the mental part of the trip, but I was scared about my physical strength. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do this now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was hard at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have gone through so much. We were very thin but also strong. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.""
In the middle of the book, Blackmore described lying in the desert, looking at the full moon and thinking about his family. How did he feel about what they went through? ""Inside me, I am trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we did it together. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I have done. But when I think about my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. Compared to that, the desert does not measure up.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We felt good because we had a purpose. Now, it is hard for me to be part of the same routine of modern life."""
CAE_18,C1,"Life Without Gadgets**
Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful tools that make life easier. But sometimes, we rely too much on these gadgets. For example, when Susan's word processor broke, she had to pay a lot of money to fix it. This made her think that gadgets can be more trouble than they are worth.
Susan started to stop using some of her household gadgets. She wondered if technology really gives us more time. Does it just make us buy more gadgets? When her broken machine made strange noises, she left it outside. Now, she enjoys taking her time to sew by hand. She feels free and not tied to a noisy machine.
There are some gadgets Susan still likes, like her washing machine. But she found joy in giving up others. For example, they returned their color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This made them spend more time walking their dog, reading, and talking with each other. 
Susan used to think sewing by hand was hard and boring. But now, she finds it relaxing and satisfying. She can listen to the radio or talk with family while she sews. She enjoys sitting by the fire with a cup of tea. 
Now, Susan thinks about what gadgets she really needs. Do they need a freezer, a microwave, or even electric lights? She realizes they could save money by doing without some of these things."
CAE_62,C1,"'Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he shakes my hand quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" He seems busy, and his workshop is full of furniture pieces and wood in many colors. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a good reputation. He has many orders and does not need to advertise. People know that if they want a nice cupboard, table, or bookcase, Hurst is the right person.
It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is harder to find one who makes furniture with good quality and simple designs. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of some modern furniture. He does not like cheap, mass-produced furniture and wants to make perfect pieces. This desire for perfection helps him succeed.
Hurst is confident in his skills. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned by asking questions and teaching himself. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some come back for more. He enjoys doing complete projects for their homes. However, he finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want.
Hurst is also kind and praises others when they deserve it. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He does not like when craftsmen try to be artists and take too long to make one piece. He thinks furniture should be useful, not just a fashion statement. Hurst is confident but also humble. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"**Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. But, scientists do not agree on why we need sleep. There are three main ideas.
The first idea says that sleep is important for our bodies. It says we sleep to keep our bodies healthy. While we sleep, our bodies fix any damage from the day and help us feel better.
The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us understand and remember what we learned during the day. Without sleep, we might not learn well.
The third idea is about energy. It says we need sleep to recharge our energy. This helps us have enough energy for the next day."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of their society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, some people love to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to the newspaper about many topics.
Being eccentric shows our individuality. Inside us, there is a struggle between wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. It is like having two trains on the same track, pushing against each other. One train is called individualism (being yourself) and the other is conformity (fitting in). Most of the time, we want to fit in more than we want to be different.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to talk about what they love or their problems. They want to be with others who understand them, even if others think their interests are strange. Being in a group can make us feel safe.
Many of us feel a pull between being ourselves and fitting in. Even when we follow the crowd, we might not like it if someone points it out. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is different. Or a new person might say, ""You must take me as I am,"" to show they do not care about rules.
Anyone can choose to be more individual. Some people become very successful by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you feel what you are doing and go after it, you will surprise many people."" But at first, this is not true eccentricity. If a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, or a hostess makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. 
However, if they keep doing these things until it becomes part of who they are, then they are eccentric. The key to eccentricity is being natural. Eccentrics do not try to be strange; they just are. They do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are.
This makes eccentrics different from other people like enthusiasts, pranksters, or attention-seekers. These people are aware of society and often act to impress others or to escape from it. But eccentrics live their lives happily, no matter what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four nature experts to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy for me to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. One of the most important is Barbara Ward. She has worked hard on environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand everything better. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" This book talks about the fast growth of cities and important themes in her life. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the guano in the sun. This book explains very well, with words and pictures, how animals communicate. If you read ""Signals for Survival"" and then watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaos turns into a smart social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the art of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to a great career in conservation. It made me love the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read this book. I had been there for two years and was feeling down because of many problems. But when I opened ""My Family and Other Animals,"" I felt happy again. The book shows animals and people together, creating a beautiful world worth saving. Some people say humans are bad because of what we have done to nature. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family. This idea is important for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library after it was published in 1966. I was immediately interested, especially in the 48 colorful bird pictures by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. These books made me start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had even more. It included beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature more. It showed me that my feelings and creativity about nature are just as important as scientific facts. Since art was my stronger subject, I felt like I had a new path opening for me."
CAE_37,C1,"**DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in newspapers. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel sad when there are no reviews, but publishers are okay with bad reviews. They think that any review can help sell books because readers want to see for themselves. Publishers like reviews that match their own feelings about a book.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both want good book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help readers find out about books and authors. Good reviews from trusted sources can really help sell books.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Many of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we need reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are better than ads because they show that the review is honest. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than the content. Good reviews can help a book and its author become very popular, but they need help from other things like recommendations and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I am not sure how publishing and reviewing work together in Britain. In the United States, a review in the New York Times can make a book very popular. In Britain, bookshops sometimes do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews still sell very well. It is hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction books allow reviewers to talk more about the subject than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they help sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it did not sell well. Many people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would pay attention. Now, sometimes an unexpected reviewer or a clever review can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith continues this craft in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates special designs for his customers. He says, ""This way, I can make a unique item."" Many of his customers are women who want to buy special gifts for their husbands. They look for gifts that show the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's weathervanes are different from the usual cockerel design. The first weathervane he made was a witch on a broomstick for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. Graham realized he could make many different designs. He decided to start a weathervane business. Before this, he worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed their roles. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of the children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic. I love designing.""
Graham has made over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always asks for the customer's approval before cutting the design. He also keeps some traditional designs in stock because people like them too. Graham says, ""People enjoy handmade items. They want something a little different.""
Graham does not want to grow his business too much because he wants to keep it a rural craft. He feels he has found his place in the market. He enjoys seeing a simple shape turn into something beautiful. For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing wind direction. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add special touches to their homes. This has helped crafts like his.
Graham is now very busy, sending weathervanes to customers all over the world. He has many buyers from America and Denmark. He explains that the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a weathervane of a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,C1,"**Beginner Takes All**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his story and success.
At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was not doing well. A film he had worked on for months was canceled suddenly. He felt sad and worried because he had not earned money for two years. He needed that film to help with his bills. A smart person in his situation would have found a job. He could have gone back to working in television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.
Nicholas had an idea for the story from a farrier he met while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were very worried until they heard about a gypsy who could talk to the horse and change its behavior in just a few hours. These special people are called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Nicholas.
He started to learn more about horse whisperers and wanted to write a movie script. But after the film project failed, he decided to write a book instead. During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He said, ""It was a funny time. I was watching people, but I felt alone and worried about my life. I had tried for ten years to be a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and worried about my family.""
By the end of August, he returned home and had written the first half of the book. His bank manager was becoming very strict, and he needed to know if he should continue writing. He showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Nicholas could get $30,000 for it. Nicholas needed more money to pay his debts. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had two months of work left.
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the book to seven publishers in the UK. Soon, his agent called to say that they had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Nicholas was shocked. His agent felt something good was going to happen. 
A week later, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US, both record amounts for a first novel. Nicholas and his team could not believe it. They had not even sent the book to New York, but soon major movie studios wanted to make a film from it. 
Nicholas's agent in the UK worked with an agent in the US. When they said they could get $3 million for the book, Nicholas and his team laughed in surprise. They decided that the studios should each present their ideas to Nicholas. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called him to ask for the rights to his unfinished novel.
Nicholas told me this story while we drank coffee on his porch at home. He said he turned down an offer to write the movie script for *The Horse Whisperer*. He felt it was like a fairy tale and did not want to ruin it. Writing for movies is very hard, and he did not want to become just an employee. He wanted to stay involved but keep some distance.
The success of his novel also brought new interest in the film *Life and Limb*, but he was not sure if he wanted to make it anymore. He said, ""I think I would be foolish not to write another novel."""
CAE_23,C1,"**Young Masters**
Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to chess, but he is not as young as he used to be. Chess is now a game for younger players. After being away from chess for 20 years, Bobby Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. He won the first game, which was very good, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, not in good shape, and has not played much recently. Boris Spassky is also older.
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Bobby Fischer helped make chess more popular, and now it is more professional. Today, players focus more on winning than on the art of the game. In international chess, a player needs to be strong mentally and physically. The pressure is high because players have to make their moves in a certain time. If they do not, they lose the game. Games are now longer, and many are played without breaks. This makes it harder for older players.
In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Most of the top ten players in the world are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Many players prepare before their matches, using computers to study many games. A small computer can hold one million chess games and help players learn about their opponents. In recent matches, players have had teams of helpers to find weaknesses in their rivals' games.
Today, there are more great chess players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Playing chess is hard work, both mentally and physically. A game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. If they lose concentration, they can lose the game. The chess clock adds to the stress. At the end of a game, players often rush to make their moves, which can be very exciting.
Losing is very painful for top players. Winning feels great, but one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to compete again the next day. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches can be even harder. For example, a match in 1984 between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov had to stop after several months because both players were too tired.
Can Bobby Fischer succeed again? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long break from chess surprising. If he is back for the money, he will earn a lot from this match with Spassky. But if he wants to prove he is still the best, the result could be very sad for him."

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is a playwright in his early 30s. He has written three successful plays. Now, he is turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. He says, ""It is a low budget, but we don’t know how low. It won’t be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before he wrote *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed. It is set in a car. I probably wouldn’t do that now because I know it is hard to do."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People’s Theatre. He realized he wanted to write for actors. ""I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read,"" he says. ""I was finally with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed learning.""
**B** Simon Pegg is a 28-year-old comedian. He studied drama at Bristol University. Now, he is writing a TV comedy series and just finished a tough tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard. He practiced his comedy in clubs while at university. He remembers, ""University was very theoretical. I realized I didn’t want to be a serious actor; I liked comedy more. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn’t. If you have courage and good material, it is great to make people laugh."" He has worked with the comedy group Funny Business, but his best work has been with Steve Coogan. ""He saw my show, and I was a big fan of his,"" Simon says.
**C** Ciaran McMenamin is 24 years old. He became famous as the lead in the show *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. People liked his performance, and now he can choose what roles he wants. ""It has been a great chance for me,"" he says. Ciaran started acting in school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. He laughs, ""I used acting to avoid homework. But then I decided I wanted to do this seriously because I loved it."" Now, he is waiting for more praise, but he thinks about fame. ""When you are 18, you think you will love the photos and interviews, but you realize it is not why you act. It is about getting respect for good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor is 25 years old and the lead singer of the pop band Matrix. They just signed a deal for three albums. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very popular when their single, *Chimera*, comes out. Neil says, ""The record company has different ideas about success than I do. They want a big hit, but I will be happy if two people buy it."" Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and tried to get into music for eight years. ""It is funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was about to give up when I met Rick, who had connections in the music industry. It was a great time for me.""
**E** Stephen Richards is a 27-year-old poet and author. He has won many awards and is well-known in the poetry world. He has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It is a story about obsessive love. It was too strong for a poem,"" he says. Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. He decided not to go to university but changed his mind when he got bored working at a theatre. After university, he published his first book, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn’t think I would be a writer; they thought I would just read,"" he says. Now, he is brave to write novels. ""Poetry has rules, but novels can be any length. I want to make sure my work is good and not just write a lot."""

B. This story is about a local radio station in America that almost fails. It is told from the view of a smart child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, which was started by two brothers to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays music and has different speakers. The author uses humor to show life in a small town and takes readers back to the simpler times of the 1940s and 1950s.
C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk to his wife's first husband. Professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poetess. He tells his wife's ex-husband about her. The poetess writes bad poetry and wants Richard to help her brother, who is in prison. The author tells this story in a funny and clever way, making it enjoyable to read.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends, two women and two men, are connected for 25 years. At the start of the story, James Hudson, a rich American, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. This is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved was killed years ago. The story has murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is good. This book lets you really get to know the characters.
E. This story is written by a great American author. It is funny and kind. Ian Bedloe feels guilty about something and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is becoming a strange bachelor. The story shows the strong bond he forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that balances sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work. 
A. It is hard to say that volunteer work helps development a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money was given directly to a local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can give. This is especially true for young people who take gap years, as they often do not have special skills or experience. Many studies ask if young people volunteer to help others or if they want to improve their own careers. However, these projects can help people learn to be kind and help those who have less.
B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can also help solve problems, encourage people to participate in global issues, and create international friendships. In this way, everyone benefits, and it helps the world. But if only rich people can volunteer, it may help them in their careers but not help the communities that need it. Those who volunteer will keep getting benefits while using the communities they help.
C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to feel good about themselves or to help in a way that does not really change things. At its best, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the communities they work in. It can also help people understand and care about the problems of poverty and injustice.
D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the idea of helping others. This idea can seem good, especially when people feel that big governments and businesses do not help. However, it can also ignore the need for real change and reduce development to just individual acts of kindness. While volunteering is good, when it is sold as a way to help develop communities, it can make people forget about the real issues of poverty and inequality in the world."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? I, along with inventor Tom Granger and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios that you can buy now.
One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. But who really needs that? This model costs about the same as another one we tested, and it has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up without news. We all thought the radio quality was very good, but the clock radio is very big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn’t work.""
This model was voted the best-looking and the overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" but the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can tap it easily with your eyes closed. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, and I ended up playing with them. This made it hard for me to understand the instruction booklet. 
The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if someone pulls the plug. We all liked this feature. However, we found it hard to set up. But once we figured it out, we felt cool and smart. Tom Granger thought this model, which has a built-in lamp, was ""very cheap"" in how it was made. He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was hard to position, and you couldn’t read by it because it only shines on the clock.
Paul Bridges thought the lamp idea was funny but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, and it made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular one on the market. It is bright and colorful, which Tom Granger and I liked. Tom said, ""I would choose this one because it stands out."" The controls were easy to use, and we set it up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 20 minutes early or late, which is funny. Paul Bridges laughed and said this model was ""very annoying"" and ""useless.""
The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, ""It’s easier to set up. With modern buttons, you are never sure if you pressed them in the right order."" He agreed that companies had to make better radios because of button tuning. I thought the tuning was not very good, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. When a hedgehog is in danger, it can roll into a tight ball. This way, its spines point outwards to protect it. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They may try to run away from danger instead of rolling up.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They often sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, which means they can sleep for a long time in winter. However, not all hedgehogs hibernate. Some stay awake all year if the weather is good."

It is hard to be good at any sport, especially for women. They have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they must make sacrifices. But despite the challenges, they are proving people wrong and breaking records. Here are some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love to ski and feel great when I jump and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel good or the weather is bad, but I keep going.

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won! I was surprised because I had never cycled before. Now, I earn good money as a professional cyclist. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because not many schools have rowing teams. Most girls start when they are older, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Coaches often change, so it can be difficult for the women’s team. But I enjoy it and like being fit, plus I have fun with my teammates.""
D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I didn’t know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very painful for me. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! Some people think women are less likely to succeed, so it is harder to get sponsors.""
E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men think they are better drivers. When I do well, they ignore me. Being a woman in racing can be tough. Men often want to beat me, and I have had many accidents. It is hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. More women are starting to race now, which is great!""
F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 AM three days a week to swim. I need to sleep more on other days. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I feel very tired! Racing is hard, but I feel happier when I stay fit. Men and women usually compete together, but the news often focuses more on the men. The prize money for women is not as good, but we are working to change that."""

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso. He was 78 years old and a famous artist. Even from far away, you could see it was him. I was 18 years old and traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had no money, so I found a job painting boats. But I spent a lot of time drawing. One day, I was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes. 
Picasso usually stayed away from people and worked in the hills. So, I was surprised to see him sitting with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I was nervous, but I asked him for his signature. To my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name on my paper and then drew some lines on it. His art often showed real things, so I thought his lines might be about the clouds or the sea.
I thanked him and tried to talk to him. Picasso did not speak much English, and I did not speak much French. An American woman at the table helped us talk. She called him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. But I told Picasso that I loved art and admired his work.
After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend the signature. He asked, ""Is that all?"" He told me to go back and talk to Picasso again. So, I took my sketchbook and returned to Picasso's table. I didn’t ask if I could draw his portrait because I was afraid he would say no. Instead, I just started to draw.
When Picasso saw me, he smiled and made funny faces to distract me. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue. It was hard to draw him, but I felt like he wanted to see how determined I was. Finally, he sat still for a few minutes, and I could really look at him. He looked strong and young for his age, with bright, dark eyes.
Even though he was with friends, he seemed alone and deep in thought. When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him, he nodded happily. Then, he surprised me by saying it was his turn to draw.
I quickly gave him my crayon, and he drew a face on my paper in just a few seconds. His drawing was very different from mine. He made my eye look like it was on my nose and my smile was just one line. I looked like a character from one of his fun drawings.
I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American woman said he said I already had his signature. So, he didn’t want to give me another one. But I felt very lucky to have met him and to have his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that shops use to make you spend more money.
**A. Freshness First**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The colors in the store, like green, can make you think of fresh food. But most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen food and cleaning products, is not fresh.
**B. Smart Placement**  
Where products are placed in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out where shoppers look for items the most. They put the most expensive products in these spots. Items at eye level are very popular because people see them easily. Special offers in big bins can also attract shoppers. Sometimes, stores place items that go well together, like ice cream and toppings, near each other.
**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place cheap items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers have to walk past more expensive items to get to them. Stores also put popular products far away, hoping that loyal customers will look for them and see other tempting items on the way.
**D. Less is More**  
Some chain stores have changed how they show their products. For example, Next stores display fewer items to make them look special. This design makes shoppers feel like the clothes are exclusive, even though they are still mass-produced.
**E. Total Costs Matter**  
Shoppers often care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items to attract customers. They sometimes sell cheap items at a loss to bring people in, which is called ""loss leaders."" They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in large amounts.
**F. Price Tags**  
In chain stores, shoppers usually buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up sales to give change.
**G. Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so shoppers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh fruits and vegetables look better.
**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the paths to walk, and another shows sales areas. This helps shoppers move through the store, but some people may not want to explore the sales areas.
**I. In-Store Ads**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see big pictures of delicious food. In some places, supermarkets are trying out shopping carts with screens that show ads for products as you shop. These carts are made to catch the attention of shoppers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington, who is 58 years old, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing paths in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, like *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. 
Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat called Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking only 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland. They wrote about their trip in a new book called *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure* and called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris how to sail. This was Chris's first time on a yacht.
They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was hard, but Chris was impressed with how steady Robin was. When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. Robin wanted to climb down using ropes like on his boat, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Chris was not very happy about it, but Robin got down safely.
During this trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they should go on a big trip to Greenland together. Robin was a great leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions first. Most of the time, people did not give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decisions.
Chris found sailing boring and hard. He did not like being in the middle of the sea for many days. He preferred being on land. Robin, however, loved sailing and enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin did not really need his help. The boat was also very small for six people, which made it hard to be close together.
When they reached Greenland, Chris had to lead the climbing expedition. He felt nervous about keeping Robin safe. Climbing the highest mountain in Greenland, called the Cathedral, was very difficult. Robin was not a natural climber, but he tried very hard. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes. Robin trusted Chris completely and followed him. When it became too hard, Chris decided they had to turn back, and Robin accepted this.
Robin was also worried about their boat and whether it would be okay in the ice. But he wanted to try climbing the mountain again. The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They were taking turns to watch the boat. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his turn, but Robin did not wake him. Robin thought he could do it alone. Chris felt that Robin did not trust him, and he told him so. Robin quickly reassured Chris that he was wrong to think that.
While they enjoyed the trip to Skye, they really got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. Chris found that Robin was a kind and sensitive person, even if he seemed tough on the outside."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been around for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of the old types of apples.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, people found apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these places, ancient people stored wild apples for winter. These apples were small and different from the apples we eat today.
**Norman Times (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. Some apples, like the dessert apple called Decio, came from the Romans. But many Roman apples did not grow well in Britain. British monks started to create new types of apples, and many of today’s apples come from these old varieties.
**Medieval Times (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a main dessert apple until the 1700s. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. But bad weather and diseases made it hard to grow apples, so people started to import them. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent a man named Richard Harris to France to learn about growing apples. Harris brought back many new apple types and started the first modern orchard in Kent.
**Settlers and Apples (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. A famous apple planter in North America was John Chapman, known as ""Johnny Appleseed."" He planted many apple trees and was loved by the Native Americans.
**Modern Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree and named the apple ""Hawkey."" At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and said it was ""Delicious!"" This apple became very popular. Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She discovered a small tree growing from old fruit and grew the first green apples, which became famous worldwide.
**Uniformity in Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most come from just a few types. These apples are often chosen for their looks or how well they travel, not for their taste. Many old apple types are disappearing. In the UK, some gardeners keep old varieties alive, but in the US, many apples from 100 years ago are gone. People want more types of apples. We need to care about keeping different kinds of apples and other foods for everyone."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners in his country. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is ten miles south of the equator. There is a mountain path that starts from a quiet road in Nairobi. This path leads to Mount Kenya, the highest mountain in Kenya. For three years, Richard has trained in this beautiful but lonely place called Nanyuk. 
On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard decided to train with Kenyan runners. He ran in his first race in Kenya, where the air has less oxygen. He stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for big competitions. Richard was invited by the national team coach after he finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 metres race. This was a great chance for him.
Training at high altitude helps runners make more red blood cells, which helps them carry oxygen better. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. Richard's first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race held in Africa, in Nairobi. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan. He felt he did well, but he knows that Kenyan runners are not just successful because of the altitude. They have a simple and relaxed way of training and competing.
Richard learned about how Kenyan runners train at their camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. The athletes live with regular students in simple rooms. Their daily routine includes three training sessions: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They start their day at six in the morning. The coach tells them to run easy because they have a hard day ahead. They run about 40 kilometres each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometres.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they drive to a stream to wash off in the evening.
By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just because of their genes or where they come from. He thinks that the simple life in the mountains, hard training, and their love for running are the real reasons for Kenya's success in long-distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"**The Problems with Mass Marketing**
Almost everyone knows that advertising is not doing well. This is not just because of the recession. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the recession really began. The problems with advertising are more serious and happen all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy.
Advertisers like to think about big groups of people and big media, but as more brands and media appear, the target audiences have become smaller and more specific. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not. This is a big reason why advertising is not working well.
Think about your own shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but there are many more products in the store. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For things like cars, you might only buy one every three years. You do not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Overall, you likely do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year.
Now, compare that to the 32,500 brands that are advertised. If we look at the 9,500 brands that are listed and analyzed, the average person only buys about 400 of them. This means that about 96% of advertising is not effective, but no one knows which part is wasted.
When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. Most people find that only about 1 in 16 ads (6%) are for brands they are interested in. This means that 94% of the ads are not useful for them.
Many people think they are different and that they do not pay attention to advertising. But the truth is, most people do not buy most of the brands they see in ads. There is always waste in advertising because people only remember a few ads and ignore the rest. 
However, advertising can still be effective. Many ads have shown that they work. Advertisers need to reach many people to find the few who will buy their products. Even with smart targeting, advertisers cannot know exactly who will respond to their ads. 
In face-to-face selling, a salesperson might succeed with every person they talk to, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use media at all. 
Any advertiser who can get one million new customers (about 2% of adults) is doing well. For popular products, gaining a million new customers would be a big success. To make advertising work again, the messages need to be more focused on specific groups of people."
CAE_43,C1,"
Charles Clover visits a very eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, England. This town has some interesting places. One is Southwell Minster, a little-known old cathedral. It has special carvings of 'green' men made by craftsmen in the 1200s. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle their waste into compost for their garden. They also heat their house using heat from their appliances and their own body heat, along with the heat from their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the old buildings in the town and was approved by planners, even though it is in a protected area.
When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet inside. The house is very well insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Inside, it feels calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens special windows to let in fresh air. They have made sure that there are no drafts in the house, even the cats have their own small door.
Robert and Brenda teach architecture at Nottingham University. They cared about the environment long before it became popular. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called The Autonomous House. They wanted to build a house that did not produce carbon dioxide. They also decided to not use mains water. They created special toilets and put rainwater tanks in the cellar. They use copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean, which they filter before using. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they think strong detergents are not good for the environment.
Robert says, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is better for the environment without living in the dark."" The only old-fashioned part of the house is the hall, which has a fireplace and a staircase that goes up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay for water. Last winter, they used only nine units of electricity a day, which cost about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use.
Soon, they will add solar panels to generate more electricity. The house will still use some electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances, but it will make extra electricity. One day, they hope to have enough to charge an electric car. The only heating in the house is a small wood-burning stove, which they only use when it is very cold.
When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18C, which is lower than usual, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no drafts. He explained that people used to feel comfortable at lower temperatures because of their warm clothing. 
The secret of the house is that it is simple and easy to maintain. Most materials were bought from a local store and installed by local workers. This made the house cheap to build, costing the same as low-cost rental housing. Many big building companies do not like this idea."
CAE_51,C1,"'The Camera Never Lies
Arthur Conan Doyle was the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories. He thought he was a logical man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photos of fairies in a garden. He believed these photos were proof that fairies really existed. He published the photos with an article, saying that fairies are amazing creatures.
In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked very nice, but the trick was simple. This goes against a common idea that cameras always show the truth. 
Today, we can use computer programs to change our digital photos. It is not true that photography has always been innocent. From the beginning, when cameras started taking pictures, the reality was changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
For a long time, iron has fascinated people, and blacksmiths, who work with iron, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as important as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The lovely metalwork in French and Belgian buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths.
However, by the late 1960s, there were very few blacksmiths in Britain. Heavy industry did not need them anymore, and modern buildings often did not use beautiful ironwork. In the last 10 years, there has been a small comeback in blacksmithing because more people are interested in decorative architecture and new interior design styles. Still, much of the work looks similar, with many companies calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find many trendy stores selling rusty candlesticks with extra pieces hanging from them.
Fortunately, there are new events to support blacksmiths. One event is an exhibition of ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). This exhibition opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We might be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal. They can now bend, twist, and weld metal more easily. Dawson explains, ""These artists can now use metal to show their creativity.""
About 250 pieces of work are in the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the artists, but some will be kept by the Association to help promote good ironwork. Dawson has made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says, ""My style comes from letting hot steel bend into shape. It's like drawing with metal in space.""
Many artists love working with iron. Unlike other metals, iron is tough and needs special care. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it is soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and strong."" Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles that look like they belong in scary castles. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever.""
Iron has given people a lot of beauty and a sense of safety. It is likely that iron will be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we do not have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**
I thought my friends would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was easy, why didn’t you stop before?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from smoking a lot every day to not smoking at all in just a few hours. 
Two months and three weeks ago, I went to a stop-smoking session. I did not plan to stop smoking, and I did not really want to. I felt pressure from people who don’t like smoking, and I still feel that way. I also had good health and did not feel sick. I thought I was healthier than some of my friends who tried to live healthier lives.
On that Thursday afternoon, I went to the session in Birmingham to write an article about people trying to quit smoking. I said, ""I won’t try to stop. I am here to write, not to quit."" I really enjoyed smoking. It made me happy. The counselor looked at me like she understood. 
We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. I began to think that stopping smoking could be a good thing. I felt strong because I thought I could stop. 
It was not too hard to stop. The cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a few minutes. I only felt them for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was easy. I was surprised that doing things at home on weekends was the hardest part. 
I realized that smoking helped me when I was bored. Having a cigarette was something to do. I do miss smoking a little, but not too much. Now, I have to deal with new experiences as a non-smoker, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a break at the theater. These are moments when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,C1,"**Dorothy Hodgkin: A Scientist You Should Know**
Dorothy Hodgkin was a British woman scientist who won the Nobel Prize. She is not very well known in her own country, which is surprising. For the last four years, I have asked my friends if they know about her. If they do, I know they are informed. 
Dorothy Hodgkin is important because she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. If someone in literature won a Nobel Prize, everyone would know their name. Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was a very special person. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and the sharing of science around the world.
When I started to learn more about her, I wanted to read biographies of other scientists. A friend of Hodgkin suggested I read about Linus Pauling, who was also a famous scientist and a friend of hers. I went to a bookstore but found no books about Pauling. I was surprised because he was a very important chemist and won Nobel Prizes for chemistry and peace.
Many people think that biographies of scientists are boring. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and bookstores feel the same. 
People often see a big difference between the arts and sciences. Only a few famous scientists have biographies in bookstores. But it is not true that scientists have less interesting lives than artists or writers. Some scientists do not want to be in the public eye because they think it looks like they are trying to promote themselves. This can make young people less interested in science.
Luckily, things are changing. Scientists are now appearing more in public, not just in interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on TV, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars. These activities help people see scientists as real people.
The way we write about scientists is also changing. In the past, scientific biographies were often boring and focused only on work. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show scientists as interesting people with lives outside of work. 
Dorothy Hodgkin worked hard in science. She discovered the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1964. She also helped solve the structure of insulin in 1969. She was a dedicated scientist but also a mother of three children and a wife to a husband who was often away.
Her personal life is important, too. It shows how she balanced her work and family. Many people can learn from her ability to connect different parts of her life. 
Understanding science can be as challenging as reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. It just takes practice. It is sad that many educated people do not know about important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,C1,"**Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins is known for her special ability to find water. She can use a forked hazel stick to detect water underground. Many farmers need her help because their wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband have a well-drilling business. They use machines like drilling rigs, but Margaret only needs her hazel stick to find water. They have a success rate of over 90%.
This ability to find water is called dowsing. Some people think it is a special skill, while others believe it is based on science. One idea is that everything vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or smell water. 
Recently, many farmers have asked for Margaret's help because of droughts. Most of her customers only need her services once because wells last a long time. Some customers have holiday homes where it is too expensive to run water pipes. Others are building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She must be careful to avoid any waste getting into the water. The water she finds is usually clean, but she has to be careful about minerals in the water. She also needs electricity to pump the water, so the well should be close to power sources.
To start, Margaret uses a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map, and it swings when she is above water. After that, she walks in the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. 
Margaret holds the stick with both hands. If water is below, the stick will rise. It is very important to drill in the right place. If she and her husband do not agree on where to drill, they will keep looking until they do.
Margaret's ability to find water is interesting to many people. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special way of sensing her surroundings. This skill helps her family run their well-drilling business successfully year after year."

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something new! We helped four people do this. Here is what happened.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda is 23 years old and has two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. 
Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and full of people. It was very different from her hometown, and she felt nervous. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was even harder! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. The other waitresses made it look easy, but Amanda dropped the drinks on the floor. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said it was okay. 
When the restaurant opened at 11:30 am, there was already a line of customers. Amanda was worried about remembering the orders, but the computer helped her. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. She often had to say ""Pardon?"" when customers spoke to her, which made her feel shy. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was very tired and wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it was a ""quiet"" day, and Amanda was surprised at how tiring waitressing was. She thought it would be easy, but it was not. She was happy to go back to her children because being a mother felt easier after that day!
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy is 30 years old and swapped lives with Amanda. She was nervous about being a mother for a day but also excited. She had to get Amanda's two daughters ready for the day. After dropping one daughter at school and the other at nursery, Cindy thought she would have some quiet time. But she had to clean the house and do laundry too!
After picking up the younger daughter, they went to the supermarket and then home for lunch. When the older daughter came home from school, things got wild! The girls jumped on the couch and screamed loudly. Cindy thought they would get tired, but they did not! She finally got them to bed at 8 pm, but then they kept asking for water to come downstairs and watch TV. Cindy realized that taking care of two small children was very tiring. She enjoyed the day but felt very responsible for them.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary is 42 years old and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a teacher. 
On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, but on this day, she could sleep until 7 am. At school, she felt nervous in front of about 400 students. She helped in a math class and a nature project. By lunchtime, she was tired but only had five minutes to eat. After lunch, she attended a meeting and helped with sports trials. She enjoyed a reading lesson and a fun French lesson, but she was very tired by the end of the day. Speaking in front of the class was hard for her. Even though teachers have more holidays, she decided she prefers farming.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary is 30 years old and swapped lives with Rosemary. She arrived at the farm early in the morning, but Rosemary had already been working for three hours! The farm has many animals, including cows and sheep. 
Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice-cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen one. She learned that if sheep are not helped quickly, they can die. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this every day, twice a day! 
Hilary felt lonely because she missed being around children. She realized that farming is not as easy as it seems. The work is hard, and it is difficult to take time off. Farming can be romantic, but it is also very challenging."
CAE_6,C1,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is interesting that many musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a special trumpet player from southern Sweden. He is 30 years old and is known around the world. He plays old music and new music. When you see him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of his trumpet. 
Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London. He also had a TV show about his work, filmed in London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo. When he was eight years old, his father gave him a trumpet as a Christmas gift. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music, so he bought a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved the trumpet and played it all the time. 
His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give him lessons. This teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw Hakan's talent right away. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher. Bo was very passionate about the trumpet and always wanted to learn more about it. 
Hakan explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is hard to make a perfect one. Each trumpet is a little different. He learned to accept these differences and work with them. Even as a child, people could recognize his special sound. 
Unlike another famous trumpet player, John Wallace, who played in orchestras, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired the French trumpet player, Maurice Andre, and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream to be a trumpet player. 
When Hakan was 15, he needed to choose a place to study. His teacher wanted him to go to America, but it was too far. Instead, he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not as exciting as being a soloist. 
Hakan knew he played better than many other young players. When he was 17, he entered a competition in Paris. He only prepared for the first round but made it to the second round. He knew most of the pieces for that round too. In the final round, he faced a difficult piece. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing and realized that people listened to him. 
Hakan is realistic about his talent. He does not want to explain how he connects with people through music because he believes it might ruin the magic. He thinks music has the power to move people."

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgery at 8:30 am. I do surgery all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or going to the bathroom. Deciding when to do surgery can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I operate, but I worry about the next day. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it works, it feels amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I meet with patients to explain their surgeries. I like this part of my job and find it easy to talk to them. If they are upset, I try to comfort them, but I have to be quick. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Sometimes, I have to be on call at night and on weekends. When I am on holiday, I worry about my patients and dream about surgery.""

I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. Most of my work is not design; it is production. I get a brief from the client about what they want. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I show my ideas to the client. If they like them, we make plans and budgets, and I hire photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I have to talk to many people, and it can be stressful. Lunch is at 1 pm for one hour. I usually eat sandwiches and work through lunch. It feels great when a client likes my designs, but it is disappointing when they do not. I get home at 7:30 pm or later.""

I have to be careful about my diet because I sit a lot during my job. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are booked in advance, so I can check the routes. Some passengers are rude, but most are nice. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

We spend about an hour and a half at each place. At 11 am, we go to a cafe for a big breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I work from home in the office, listening to messages and returning calls. If someone wants a new garden, I meet them in the evening. We use old materials to make gardens look historic. It is very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the phone. I sleep well because my job is very physical.""

I talk to current card users, find new ones, and work with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes planning my day and then check my emails. I have many meetings during the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different countries in Europe once or twice a week to solve problems.

I leave work by 7:00 pm and often go to concerts in the evening. Sometimes I don’t get home until 1:00 am.
**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving at 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule for the day. I enjoy showing customers our furniture and helping them buy pieces.

I work in shifts. If I have an early shift, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start work at 7:00 am and take over from the night shift. I control aircraft movements with my team. In winter, we manage about 1,000 flights a day. Night shifts are quieter, and I can read about new rules. This job is stressful, and I need to be alert. I want to become a watch manager and then a general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start the electronic sales system and make sure someone is at the cash register. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy helping them, but it can be hard when they expect me to find many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, I meet with publishers to discuss new books. I need to make sure new titles arrive on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work late and close the shop.

CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps them grow. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says that leadership is about making things happen with people who are excited and interested. A good leader should speak clearly and confidently. It is important to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. John van Maurik, who teaches a Leadership in Management course, says that many people can be great leaders if they recognize their talents and develop them. We all have the potential to be leaders; we just need the right situation to grow. It is easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, but it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. However, being a good leader is very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and supported you. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first leader was very good; the second leader was very bad.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new ideas. Micheal Shea, who wrote about leadership, says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a sad organization into a happy one.
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Find what you are passionate about and act on it.  
- Start thinking of yourself as a leader. You have the power to lead.  
- Sometimes you need to be a strong leader. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead instead. See how this changes things.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better.
F. Leadership does not just happen. You need to take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, and give praise.  
- Don’t think your way of leading will always be liked. Keep working on how you communicate. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and available to important people.  
- Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense movie about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of tough heroes in older movies. The special effects and set design are very good, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. The story feels like a simple B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on a book about the battle for Guadalcanal. It is directed by Andrew Marton and is different from Terrence Malick's version. Marton’s film is more traditional and focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick’s film is richer and more complex, but Marton’s version has some good moments, like a scene where the soldier dreams of his wife.
**C. On Guard**  
This fun movie is based on a novel from 1875. It is better than many other musketeer films. The villain, played by Fabrice Luchini, is a sneaky politician causing trouble. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, and Daniel Auteuil plays a moody character who is also a swordsman. The film has many clichés, but it is entertaining.
**D. Character**  
This serious film is set in Rotterdam at the start of the 20th century. The detailed costumes and sets make it look like a museum. Jan Decleir plays a harsh bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. His difficult relationship with his son is the main story, but the film focuses too much on the details and not enough on the dark story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released film shows the skill of director Leone. The sound is very clear, making every step and noise stand out. The story is harsh, and when it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement. The characters, the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all act in selfish ways in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This war movie features many international stars and has four directors and 23,000 extras. The early parts of the film, where soldiers wait for news about an invasion, feel slow. While it is impressive in scale, it is better to watch on a big screen. Watching it on video does not give the same experience."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is a very interesting story. The main character is a lawyer who has to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, helps rich people in Italy during the Renaissance. He gets involved in politics and a murder case, but we believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated and a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective named Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She starts investigating when a strange man dies in front of her. Even though she faces problems and the local detective does not support her, Leah is brave and smart. She is a great character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more thinking than usual. It is always good entertainment from Parker.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn looking into a robbery at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's easy writing style and focus on strange human behavior make this a fun mystery.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw shows actor Philip Fletcher in a new role as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the story is not as strong.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are looking for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it better than an average detective novel."
CAE_57,C1,"I might be too old for this, but here I go! Tim Pozzi is 34 years old. He has left his good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age want to travel. This summer, he quit his job, rented out his flat, and plans to travel in South East Asia for a year. Some people might think he is lucky, but he feels nervous. He has traveled before. After university, he spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When he came back, he wanted to travel again, but then he fell in love, started a career, and got used to earning money. 
Tim realized he was giving up his happiness for his job. When he quit, he felt like he was in control of his life again. Many of his friends are now married with children. They do not want to change places with him, but they envy his freedom. Tim is not in a relationship and does not have big career goals. He feels he should enjoy his freedom, especially for his friends.
But why is he so nervous? First, he has to make plans. He worries about someone else living in his home and how to rent it out. He also needs to decide where to go. He is a big procrastinator and is already behind on his plans. He thought about enjoying the summer in England and waiting for the football season to start. 
Tim is also worried about leaving his comfortable life. He wonders if he can still handle backpacking. Will he fit in with younger backpackers? Many people in their late twenties and thirties in Britain want to leave their normal lives and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says more people are realizing they can have adventures if they are brave and organized.
Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, see this trip as a last chance before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says he is ready to give up job security for this trip. He knows he might return to the same job position, but he thinks it is a risk worth taking. 
For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling helped him change his life. He needed to break away from the strict way of doing things in the military. There are many reasons for people to travel at this age. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says more people work on short-term contracts, so if a contract ends, they have nothing to lose. Some big companies even allow career breaks.
Dan Hiscocks, who runs a company about travelers, says many people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. If they are not happy, they know they can change things. Travel gives them a chance to think about what they want. 
Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation cannot handle being adults? Jennifer Cox does not think so. She believes it shows we are better educated and want a balanced life. We are asking ourselves, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is going to Central America for a year. He does not think he is running away; he is running towards something he wants. But he feels nervous about leaving his comfortable routine.
I understand Ben's worries about leaving a stable life. I might not be going on this journey if I had not found my boss so difficult. Jennifer Cox says this is common. Sometimes a big change, like a breakup or losing a job, pushes people to travel. 
Even though it took a push for me to start, I am excited about the next 12 months. No matter what happens, I will feel good about taking this chance. I believe many older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,C1,"**Plugging in the Home**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist. She felt lost because of new technology. In this story, she explains how she changed her home into a good place to work.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37. I realized I needed to get back to my journalism career. I felt like my skills were old-fashioned, stuck in the 1980s. Back then, we used typewriters, and I didn’t know how to use a computer. Many job ads asked for skills in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought it would be easier to host a seminar on nuclear physics than to use a computer for work. I was scared of technology; even calculators confused me, and I didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.
I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my kids would be hard. But then, I entered a contest in a local newspaper and won a computer package! We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world of the Internet and started chatting with people from around the world. My kids stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take my kids to school.
My children were good with computers because they learned at school. I was nervous and thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I was wrong! I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical and easy. With practice, I learned more every day. Now, I write articles for a magazine, about two each month. I feel proud that I can balance work and family.
How has the computer helped me? In school, my desk was always messy, and I lost important papers. Now, the computer helps me stay organized. I can keep track of money and create invoices easily. As a journalist, I can research stories online and talk to other writers from around the world.
But working from home has some downsides. I can feel lonely without seeing people. There are also distractions at home, like chores, and my kids sometimes argue about who gets to use the computer.
Many people in my neighborhood have bought computers, not just for learning but also for fun. More people are working from home instead of commuting to the city every day.
A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" says that most home computer users are 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have printers and modems. I feel like I am doing well with my computer skills. One day, I might even send an article to a newspaper in Melbourne or start my own magazine from home. The possibilities seem endless!"
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has modern buildings that look very different from the old city around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened.
You cannot miss the museum. It is on the corner of Chambers Street. The building has a big yellow tower and unique shapes. Some people think it is beautiful, while others do not like it at all. 
Now, the inside of the museum is almost ready. The exhibitions will tell many stories about Scotland. There are important objects, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. The museum wants to show these treasures without too much national pride. 
Dr. David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He wants the museum to be fun and easy to understand for everyone, not just experts. He believes that the museum should show the truth about the past. 
Visitors will see explanations and pictures to tell the stories of the objects. There are also computers to help. But it is still unclear if this will be enough to keep people interested.
When you enter the museum, you will notice the different spaces. The galleries connect to each other, and the walls look like big stone blocks. Light comes in from the windows and the roof, making it bright inside. There is space to enjoy each item on display.
There is also a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of kids aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a special area for hands-on activities.
On the top floor, there is a gallery about the 20th century. It will change every three years and shows items chosen by Scottish people. Some suggested things like electric guitars, televisions, and toys. 
Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The museum's modern design is impressive inside, but some wonder if it is in the right place."
CAE_54,C1,"**The Future of Newspapers**
The change from print newspapers to online news is happening slowly. Some people are scared of this change, while others find it challenging. Transition means moving from the present to the future. But the change for newspapers to go online is not easy. Many people think it will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are going down, but visits to their websites are going up.
For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year. However, their websites are getting more visitors. This is true, but it depends on many factors like time and location. 
A recent survey showed that worldwide newspaper sales actually went up by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries went down, sales in Asia increased. News magazines also saw a 5.4% rise in sales. So, while some areas of magazines are struggling, many are growing quickly.
E-books are also becoming very popular, with sales increasing a lot this year. But when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books, they found that sales were only down by 0.4%. This shows that people are buying both e-books and physical books.
Many people think young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but this is not true. The latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.
In the past, experts thought that online advertising would help newspapers succeed. But now, online ads are actually going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to get readers to pay seems to be offering both print and online access together. 
Print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. They make much more money from print ads than from online ads. However, it is hard and expensive for newspapers to keep both print and online versions. But print newspapers still have a strong presence, while it is harder to get noticed online."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more exciting than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer must pay attention to how people move, their gestures, and their expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking pictures of groups, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can have some people sitting or kneeling in front so you can see all their faces.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is clear you are. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel shy. You may need to guide them. A picture can be less interesting if the person looks away.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo looks better if the person is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They do not have to smile. If they seem distracted, remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural. Candid shots can be very interesting, and the person's expression is important.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for common expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up. They are a quick way to show feelings.
**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person are powerful, the background can add more interest. Make sure the background does not distract from the person. A wide-angle lens can help make the person look bigger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**  
Good pictures often happen when people are interacting, like talking or laughing together. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams can make great photos. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a handshake.
**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken on trips. To show people with a nice background, step back to include the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera while keeping the background visible. A higher camera position can help with this. A good photo shows both the people and the place equally.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone you met on holiday, ask them to pose in front of a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all posed. Candid photos of events are often more lively and can bring back memories better than posed pictures."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings look real but are actually tricks for the eyes. Joanna Watt interviews her.
Not many artists do not sign their work unless someone asks them to. Sarah Janson is one of these artists. She does not think the artist is important; she believes the work is what matters. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This makes the interview a bit difficult. She says, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she looks scared when asked to take a photo.
After 30 minutes, Sarah feels more comfortable. The interview becomes interesting and funny. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she was not happy with illustration. She started working with a decorator named Jim Smart, who asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting. After that, she knew this was her path. She left to work on her own, not knowing exactly what would happen, but feeling it was the right choice.
Sarah's skills in observing details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. She says, ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation."" She believes she is still learning. She is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math. When she had a big job to paint a ceiling, she got confused with the measurements and thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?""
Sarah often talks about herself in the third person. After finishing a big project, she thinks, ""Well, I didn't do it, she did."" Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special and different from others. She has many important clients. Most of her work is inspired by buildings. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room that looks like a beautiful Venetian building.
With trompe-l'oeil art, there is a risk that once people understand the trick, they lose interest. Sarah knows this and says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination."" She believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal for the client. She enjoys working with clients because that is where the best ideas come from. Some clients know exactly what they want, while others do not. She listens to them and tries to understand their ideas.
Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working. Sarah is thankful for her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy. Even though she does not like to talk about her talent, she says, ""I really don't like to shout about myself. Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout.""
It is true that Sarah does not want to be loud, but her work is very special and deserves more attention."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman talks about the important ""people skills"" needed to succeed in our jobs.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or how well we were trained. Now, we are also judged by how we manage ourselves and how we get along with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who will do very well at their job and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future jobs. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well on tests is not as important anymore. Now, it is more about social skills and personal qualities, like being proactive, understanding others, being flexible, and convincing people. These skills are called emotional intelligence.
B. Today, many jobs do not offer security, and we need to have skills that we can use in different jobs. Personal qualities are becoming very important at work. For a long time, people have talked about these qualities using different names, like ""character"" or ""soft skills."" Now, we call them emotional intelligence. This means being able to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others. In our work, emotional intelligence includes being aware of ourselves, controlling our emotions, being motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means being nice, but it can also mean being honest, even when it is hard. It is not about showing all our feelings but managing them so we can work well together.
C. More businesses are realizing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard for them to use their knowledge and skills. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for doing well in any job.
D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we live and learn. Studies show that most people get better at managing their emotions and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our jobs, especially now when jobs are less stable. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies that are not doing well, and it does not guarantee success. But if we ignore the human side of work, nothing else will work as well."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones make it easy to take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how people share these photos. Now, some journalists use social media to find images of fast-moving events. But some reporters have used pictures from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is strong public interest. However, people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure that people are paid for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is a type of treatment that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes using herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is often used to help with pain, and many doctors in the West use it for this purpose.
**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**
In traditional Chinese medicine, health means that the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. There is a special energy called Qi (pronounced ""chee"") that flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or sick. 
When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check your pulse, look at your tongue, and ask about your health, feelings, and habits. They use very thin needles to help the flow of Qi. Sometimes, they also use heat from herbs or apply pressure to certain points.
**Acupuncture Points**
The points where acupuncturists place needles are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is moved. This shows that the needle is working with the Qi. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians.
**How Does Acupuncture Work?**
Even though Western doctors do not fully accept traditional Chinese medicine, many believe acupuncture can help with pain. They think it might work by blocking pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.
**What Pain Can Acupuncture Help?**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It can help with back pain, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain and pain in terminally ill patients.
**Modern Use of Acupuncture**
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China see that acupuncture is more than just a mental trick. In China today, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, and it can help reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia.
**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**
Research shows that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helpful for chronic pain. Acupuncturists say it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some people may feel better after just two or three visits.
**A Different Way to Treat Pain**
Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They spend time understanding the pain and what might be causing it. They ask questions about how the pain feels and what makes it worse. This is different from how many regular doctors treat pain.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using their methods can lead to better healing. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist, and they should refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems very confident, but she is actually shy. She has created a detective named Adam Dalgliesh, who is a bit like her. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write alone. She needs quiet time to write and feels she can write anywhere if she has privacy.
Many people read her books, and she is considered one of the best crime writers in Britain. She enjoys reading books by other women writers, but she also likes some male authors. P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, Cover Her Face, was published. 
She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student. Life was not easy for her. Her husband became very sick after the Second World War, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband’s parents helped take care of the girls during this tough time.
P.D. James worked for the National Health Service and later for the Home Office. She learned a lot about crime while working there. She liked writing detective stories because it allowed her to create order from chaos. She believes that solving a crime in a story shows the importance of life, even if the characters are not very nice. She has always loved reading detective stories and wanted to be a writer."
CAE_5,C1,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to give a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. 
Researchers say handwriting analysis can help show certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer. It can also show emotional issues. More companies are using handwriting analysis to help with job interviews. Many big companies hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure if graphology is useful.
Patricia Marne is a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience. She thinks doctors should take handwriting analysis seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some health conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if someone should focus on arts or sciences and if they are honest or tricky.""
According to Ms. Marne, handwriting can help find possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have messy handwriting. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in childish handwriting or in writing letters many times."" 
Ms. Marne can tell if people are honest or if they might manipulate others. She says young male offenders often have tall letters, which means they dream big. Graphologists can see if someone is under a lot of stress or if they might hurt others. Handwriting can even help predict if someone might think about suicide. 
She also says heart and lung problems can show in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from one sample unless the writing is very shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time, it could mean something serious is happening,"" she explains. A big emotional upset can also change a person's signature for a short time.
Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people who write with letters that connect are often clever and tricky. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity. Original handwriting shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing means the person may be a loner. Small signatures can show shyness, while circles over the letter ""i"" can mean someone wants attention.
Ms. Marne believes it takes six years of study to analyze handwriting well. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She believes it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can show a person's history and emotional problems without asking questions.
However, many psychiatrists do not agree with her. They say handwriting is just a result of education and the way people are taught to write, and it does not mean anything else."
CAE_41,C1,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**
Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no mechanical ventilation. The windows open to the street. It is surprising that this office works well, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They change the office temperature by opening doors or using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be why they feel comfortable.
  
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture does not match, and some chairs are old and broken. This can cause bad posture. However, the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This variety helps them avoid tiredness and boredom.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoys the different types of work and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office looks nice and is fun.
**Office B: News Service**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air quality is good, and there is a No Smoking policy.
- **Ergonomist:** The company has good chairs and lighting. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The office feels impersonal with plain grey walls.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for some planners and a poster. Most staff have worked there for over five years, and they get along well. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information easily.
**Office C: Bank**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers nearby.
- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and not very inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for computer work. The computer screens are not set up well.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff helps each other and uses technology well. There are many awards on display. The office is busy, but the colors make it feel a bit dull.
**Office D: Newspaper**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, and the temperature changes a lot. The space is messy, and there is not enough desk space. It is also very dusty.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is not suitable for a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not help workers, especially shorter people.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is dirty, with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. There were not many conversations when we visited; everyone seemed stressed. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular and many Americans chew 12 million sticks of it every day. It is a big business that started from an old custom. Each stick of chewing gum has less than ten calories, but it is considered food and must follow rules from the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most chewing gum is made with synthetic materials. These include pine resins and softeners that help keep the flavor and make the gum feel better. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like substance from the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and make their breath smell nice.
American colonists learned to chew gum from the Native Americans in New England. They chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States sold spruce gum, which was the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s when people discovered chicle. Chicle is a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, leading to a big industry. However, it is hard to grow sapodilla trees, so many gum makers now use synthetic materials.
Today, the few people who collect chicle, called chicleros, have a tough life. They walk for miles in very humid conditions to tap the sapodilla trees. There are dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. One insect, the chicle fly, lays eggs in the ears and nose of the collectors. Chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp. There, they boil the sap until it becomes sticky and forms bricks.
Life in the camp is not easy. The workers eat a simple diet of maize and drink local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico.
As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to save money. Gum makers also find clever ways to sell their products. They say chewing gum can help you relax, give you energy, and reduce stress. During the world wars, soldiers were often given gum. One of the biggest claims is that chewing gum helps reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but chewing gum can help increase saliva, which protects our teeth.
Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors for gum. Glycerine and vegetable oils are now used to make the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

B. **NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel is on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After climbing a glacier, I was surprised to see this hotel in a beautiful, wild area. It was luxurious, and there was a man playing piano music. It was an amazing experience after a long climb.
C. **MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
The Paradis Hotel is on a quiet peninsula in Mauritius. The road to the hotel goes along empty beaches where only fishermen are found. The hotel is big and offers free water sports, but you can find peace on the nine-kilometer private beach. If you swim a little, you can hardly see the hotel because of the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone leaves, it feels very calm and far away from everything.
D. **ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watched her work. One minute into her inspection of the Globe Hotel, things are already going wrong. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue whispers, ""She hasn’t even seen us. Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 
Sue says, ""This hotel has three red stars, so I expect better."" The red stars mean the Globe Hotel is one of the best hotels in the guide that Sue works for. But even before they enter, things feel cold. The entrance from the car park is through a door with a buzzer, and the hallway is long and empty. Sue says, ""This is not what I expected.""
Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but only 3 are occupied. One room is on the top floor, but Sue does not like it. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. 
When Sue started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" but she never wore black and did not think she was tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. He says, ""We think there is a blocked drain."" 
Sue suggests that he should not let guests go into the room with the smell. She says, ""Maybe guide them to the other lounge."" Robin nods and takes notes. He has only worked at the Globe for five months and finds it hard to believe Sue when she says her comments will help the hotel in the future.
Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, for their good work. Dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Robin asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that falls apart."" 
Sue’s job is to say what many customers do not want to say. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired. Sue explained that the son served her apple pie with his fingers. Sometimes, people write angry letters about her reports. Sue says, ""You get used to it, but it still hurts.""
Sue must tell the hotel what she finds and also write a full report. The hotels pay for her help. It is worth it for them to have red stars. Robin is happy to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems are fixed. Robin smiles but looks worried. ""We’ll look forward to that,"" he says."
CAE_48,C1,"**Climbing the Seven Summits**
Doug Scott is a mountaineer who writes about his experiences climbing the highest mountains on each continent, called the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will tell us about each mountain in the order he climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave below the top of Mt. Everest. They talked about sleeping bags, which Doug thought was strange because they were alone. He started talking to his feet because they were cold. Doug remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug thought about their time on the mountain. He felt calm and believed they would succeed. He focused on climbing better to reach the top.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food. After the first day, they realized how hard their climb would be. They followed a route from 1967 but then chose a new path to the summit. They carried everything on their backs. They camped under a rocky cliff, and by the third day, Doug's sleeping bag was wet. They spent a night on a windy ridge and felt very tired. The air was thin, making it hard to breathe. Finally, they reached the summit and felt proud.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. Instead, they got a free ride to Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain. They got lost in the jungle and had trouble finding water. On the second day, they found arrows on trees that led them to a rock pool. Doug was happy to find anything on the mountain. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the top.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who invited them to join his group. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and windy. They decided to take a different route to avoid the glacier. They walked with many other climbers to the summit. The wind was strong, and they camped outside as it got dark. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits. They encouraged Doug to do the same.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif was possible if he guided enough people to pay for the trip. In November 1992, his team left for the South Pole. The sun was always shining, and it was very quiet. On December 7, they started climbing to the summit. Despite strong winds and very cold temperatures, they all reached the top in eight hours. However, they could not see much because of a storm.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team met in St Petersburg. They went to Elbrus and had to pay a fee to their guide. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up the mountain. They walked to a refuge and then climbed in strong winds. They thought they reached the top but found there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then went down the volcano.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their trip to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to climb the mountain and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers, but they continued their journey. On May 12, they started climbing. The weather got better, and two team members went ahead. Doug and another member climbed slowly because they were filming. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a warm welcome for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.
Peter MacCann is the General Manager. He wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it. He likes how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature between 14°C and 25°C.
The hotel is also good for business guests. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the guests will be business travelers. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for new technology, so they have extra cables for future upgrades. They rent televisions and DVD recorders, so they can change them for newer models when needed.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and cozy bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has made a new kitchen that is modern and better than before. The hotel benefits from having a great restaurant without financial risks. With good technology and staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The big garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. There are many colors and shapes in the two long flower beds along the path that goes through the garden. This is because the previous owners loved gardening and left plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny would say some of Susan's ideas were not good, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood her vision.
Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one."" Sometimes, it can take her a couple of years to finish a painting.
Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" But she also enjoys watching how flowers change as they wilt. For example, with tulips, ""You bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day, and they each form different shapes. They open up and look amazing.""
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks.
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they grow well in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t break anything. 
Now, with two art shows coming up and many flowers to paint, it has been hard for her to work in the garden. She has hired an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in Brackham were knocked down in the big storms last March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town look very different, and some people were not happy about it. 
One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. But during the storm, he was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and a tight chest. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he thought he was too important to go. He tried to keep working, but this made him forget things and made him angry.
Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. Soon, he got medicine and went home to Molly, who sent him to bed. 
On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the night. Pelham was too sick to understand. Later, he asked if the house was damaged. When he learned it was fine, he felt relieved and went back to bed.
On Saturday, when the medicine started to work, Pelham got up. He was shocked to see that the living room looked very different without the walnut tree. Their big house had a nice garden, and Pelham was happy he bought it. The garden made them feel private. 
Before, the walnut tree made the living room look nice with light and shadows. But now, without the tree, the room was too bright, and the old furniture looked bad. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.
“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said to Molly. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed happy. “I’ve been saying this since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,B2,"**Living in the Valley**
We had lived in our valley for sixteen months when we first saw the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. 
Then, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. The snow almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. In the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we only felt some strong gusts of wind; the trees moved, but their branches stayed strong. 
We knew we had to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really scare us. The river, called the Ryburn, was what worried us the most. It usually flowed gently, but we remembered what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams built many years ago. 
Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These clouds looked dangerous and warned us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing. 
Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a small Niagara Falls, as water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river looked wild as the water rushed down towards us. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was deeper than we had ever seen, moving quickly and dangerously. 
For three days, we hoped the river would stay below its banks. Luckily, the dam held, and the water began to go down. In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually everything is fine. The water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only a little overflow sometimes. 
Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel excited by the river's power. Thanks to the dam, we feel our home in the valley is safe."
FCE_21,B2,"Film critic Mark Adams thinks about his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he wrote reviews for novels in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did some work for the radio. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. Tom hired him, but he was not a journalist, so he did not choose his staff carefully.
At first, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a lunch every week to choose what to write about, and there would be guests to make it fun. Mark felt like he was in a dream because it was a new newspaper, and he was part of the team. He thought it was strange that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even felt like a rich person was helping him and pretending to hire him. The first time he saw someone reading his review in the newspaper on the London Underground, he felt very shy.
Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, so they talked on the phone instead. It turned out that people liked to have one reviewer for each subject, so Mark chose to focus on films. Without Tom's help, they would not have the current way of working, where Mark writes a long article each week about one film. He likes this way of working. He did not want to be a standard film critic who has to watch every new film. That would make him tired and bored quickly.
Mark has the freedom to write more deeply about films, or sometimes he has to make something interesting out of a boring week. He wonders what his role is for the public. He thinks people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. People usually stick to what they like. Someone who does not like westerns is unlikely to watch one just because of a review, and a fan of love stories will not avoid a romantic film because of what the papers say.
So, if a film review is not a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark does not feel he must be ""right"" about a movie. He does not think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present an argument. He does not want to be a judge."
FCE_46,B2,"**Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun.""**
Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves sports. She is looking for a training partner for triathlons, especially a girl. She wants someone who enjoys running long distances (like 15km), swimming in cold water, and cycling long distances (like 100km). It is important to be able to do all three sports without taking a break.
Triathlons are becoming very popular in the Olympics. Many people watch athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. It looks hard, but Melanie enjoys it. She started doing triathlons when she was 14 years old. In her first race, she won the junior section, but she was the only one in that group. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. She swam fast and ran fast, but she got lost and cycled too far. She cried while running, but she did not give up.
Melanie is very determined. She sometimes wishes she could stop because it hurts, but she is afraid that if she stops once, she might want to stop again. Steve Trew, the coach, admires her hard work. He said she worked so hard on the running machine that she fell into a wall. Most people stop when they are tired, but Melanie keeps going.
This year, Melanie was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She is working hard to improve her cycling because she is slower at it than swimming and running. She is trying to convince her parents to buy her a new bike for the World Championships in New Zealand, which costs a lot of money.
Melanie trains a lot, so she does not have much time for friends. She says, ""I don't have a social life."" After swimming for two hours on Friday nights, she just wants to sleep. But she still talks to her teammates about their race times, not about boys or clothes.
Melanie has tried other shorter events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to try even harder races, but she has no one her age to train with."
FCE_70,B2,"**The Collectors**
Amanda Roy talks about collecting things and why many people enjoy this hobby. Many adults like to collect items. It is a fun and exciting world. But if you want to collect something, remember: you should love the item. 
People have always liked to collect. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. This was the first way people gathered objects for fun and meaning. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.
I have collected things all my life. I have collected flowers like tulips, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a cold place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum. The museum had many interesting objects collected by people long ago. I loved looking at them.
Many adults also enjoy collecting. Some people collect because it is the only thing they can control in their lives. For me, I just enjoy it. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful items. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had over 4,000 paintings.
You do not need to be rich to collect. I have collected many different things, like tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I convinced another collector to give me a special tulip. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared. Someone stole it!
I once collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was lost when my house caught fire. The next day, I saw the remains of my collection and my furniture. I was very sad.
I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet can be very valuable. As small items become popular, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I threw away the boxes and the toys!)"
FCE_3,B2,"**My Line of Work**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and tell people about it. I read about the topic of the exhibition and talk to important people to find out the main ideas. I decide what objects and pictures to show. I make sure the public can understand the exhibition by planning fun activities, workshops, and shows. I also work with engineers and electricians to keep visitors safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning how to drive in London. They find the best routes and learn about one-way streets and turns. I help when there are disagreements, like if a right turn is allowed. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route but tell them they must take a different way because the road is closed. This helps them think of new routes.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the sea and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work on the coast. I work with schools and run courses for people who manage the coast and make decisions about the sea. I take them out on a boat to show them the life under the water. This helps them understand better than just using a computer. I love my job because conservation is my hobby, but I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money to do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is very varied. I make sure our publishing program meets what people want and keep about 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like maps of countries, and I need to respond carefully. I talk about future projects and sales with my co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is that there is too much paperwork, which takes time away from more interesting work like product development and design."

We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made some changes, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. 
""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were in school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. 
""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she is usually waiting in the big hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms we would stay in. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband takes care of repairs and decoration. 
""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. 
Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we did not play long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the cliff path to the beach. 
In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we had made this plan many times. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a regular job. ""I meet successful people every week,"" she says.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. The guests eat porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She thinks cleaning is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, I can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.
After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""I hate coming to a messy kitchen in the morning,"" she says. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great,"" she says.
Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.
On Sunday, Sarah starts work early. Breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. ""We clean everything,"" she says. If she has not done the shopping for the week, she does it now. At around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive at about 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis. She takes them to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink after dinner, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour was surprised that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research about the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class who had visited the factory years ago. Seymour had shown them how he made gloves, especially the special table where the workers shaped and pressed each glove using hot brass hands. Marie called them ""pancake hands"" because they looked strange.
Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He liked that she was interested in all the details. He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I worked there for six months when I started."" 
""Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" he asked. ""Not yet,"" she said. ""You should go if you want to write about leather. I can help you visit one. They are old places. The technology is better now, but it is still similar to what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. They found tanning tools that are six thousand years old in Turkey. The first clothes were just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s an interesting subject. My father knows a lot about leather. If you talk to him about gloves, he could talk for two days. People who make gloves love their work.""
""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" he asked. ""Not really,"" she replied. ""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" Seymour laughed. She made him smile. She was eager to learn, and she reminded him of Marie.

Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But there is one small problem: she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings, and making travel plans. Raquel did not apply for this job. She met a pop group manager by chance and got the job. She also took secretarial classes at night. Five years later, she became a personal assistant.
**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because he loves golf. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee and a percentage of the winnings. Most caddies earn between £25,000 and £35,000, but they spend a lot on travel and hotels. David was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. ""You do more than just carry bags. You give advice and try to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized, and he became a statistical data administrator for European Tour Productions. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are important for TV commentators and golfers.

""If people can pay, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His friend, who was an editor, offered him a food column because Martin is a good cook. At that time, he worked in advertising and it helped him earn extra money. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I would earn less money, but it was a chance to turn my passion into a job.""

Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy; I have to work hard for them,"" he says. ""I usually write in the mornings. I do not wake up very early. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old typewriter, not a laptop."" He receives 50 to 100 letters a week, which he enjoys.

FCE_66,B2,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust. The sawdust looked like golden mountains and covered the ground near the blue lake. 
One afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored. They climbed up a ladder to the roof of the old building and sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down!"" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards!"" 
His friends looked scared but then one by one, they jumped down and laughed with relief. They all lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. After a while, one friend said, ""Let’s go back up and jump again."" They were not very excited, but they climbed back to the roof and jumped off quickly. 
Soon, only Michael was left on the roof. His friends called up to him, ""Come on, Mike! What’s wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump down too, but he stayed at the edge, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and take a deep breath, but he couldn’t jump. His friends started to laugh at him because he was taking too long. They got tired of waiting and began to walk away, still shouting at him. 
Michael felt sad and alone. He stayed on the roof for almost an hour, watching the sun go down. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a long time, and the yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 
When he got up, he felt ashamed and walked home slowly. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said, ""You should be able to get home on time. If you can’t, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a kind woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair. But Michael didn’t really hear her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change but don’t know how? Kitty Doherty has some good advice for you. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. 
First, you will write a short history about yourself. Then, you will take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will get a summary of the results. The adviser will suggest different careers and any training you might need.
I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the career test felt like being back in school. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard to understand. They included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes.
After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was surprised to learn that I did not do well in the science and technical tests. I was glad to hear that I made the right choice in journalism.
Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. Donna said, ""Losing my job was a good chance for me to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of training in design,"" she said. 
Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her skills and find a job that suited her better. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have found this job without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she really wanted to do. She has sent many friends there, and they are all happy with the service.
Some people feel they really needed help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and made important decisions. After working at a bank for six years, she thought her job was boring and wanted a new challenge. She didn’t know what to do, so she went to the service with an open mind. The tests showed she was interested in sciences. 
She had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided to study geology and start a degree later this year. She thinks the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. Now, she is much happier.
However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, was a sales representative. She felt lost in her career and hoped a careers adviser would suggest something new. Although she got many ideas, she did not like them because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. She felt she did not learn anything new about herself. ""You have to share a lot of personal information, and I think a friend would give me the same advice,"" she said."
FCE_22,B2,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**
If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a nice blue couch. Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only visit the dentist when they are in pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make the office a place where people feel safe. That is why he does not wear a white coat. Many people think a white coat means pain. Jerome believes that dental visits should be relaxing and enjoyable.
This is surprising for many people who think going to the dentist is scary. Jerome says, ""If people feel relaxed and happy, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ideas is to use virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular."" Patients wear the headsets during their check-up. They sit on the blue couch and watch a movie about underwater animals while Jerome checks their teeth. Then, the headset shows them a special view of their mouth.
Most patients like this part of their visit. The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like oranges. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. The usual dentist smell can make people feel scared. I thought the nice smell in the office was very pleasant.
Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, but he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation ideas are important, but giving good treatment is the most important thing. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a little strange at first, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental methods. He says, ""When you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too."" He believes that his way of treating patients is changing the serious style of British dentistry.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea, and asks what video he would like to watch. He gently leads the patient to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beautiful salon than a regular dental office."
FCE_39,B2,"**Bitter Water Becomes Popular**
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is about eight percent of all chocolate sales. People eat more chocolate at Christmas than at any other time.
The cacao plant, which is used to make chocolate, was first grown by the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is big like a melon and has 20 to 40 seeds inside. When these seeds are dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, these are often called cocoa beans, but this is a mistake from the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. They added spices to this drink for special occasions. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took a long time for this recipe to reach Europe.
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in big cities in Europe where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, people made chocolate drinks from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, a man named CJ van Houten from the Netherlands created chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. 
The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate and sugar to make a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk to make milk chocolate. 
At first, French companies sold most of the chocolate in Britain. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract customers with a French name. Then, in 1905, Cadbury created the Dairy Milk bar, which became very popular because of clever advertising that linked it to healthy milk from the countryside. 
Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies are trying new ideas to attract customers, like making chocolate bars into ice cream or desserts. 
However, cacao farmers are still struggling because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is very good at his art. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he is happy making beautiful objects from shells. 
As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring at all. He is very interesting and his creations are beautiful. He shows me some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I don’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them."" Peter never planned to sell his work. About five years ago, some friends told him he should have an exhibition so more people could see his art. They helped him talk to a gallery owner.
His first exhibition was in London, and 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened yesterday. The prices for his work are high, around £2,000 for some decorations. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he does not set the prices, but he knows his work is special. The gallery owner told him that one day, when he stops making art, everyone will want his pieces.
Peter wishes he had started making art earlier in his life. He thinks he could have made even more wonderful things. Now, he feels he cannot do as much because he is older. However, his work is very different from the common shell items you find in seaside shops. He has a creative mind and makes boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of very realistic flowers.
Peter has his own way of working. He uses materials he finds, like cardboard from shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His work is very detailed and beautiful.
Peter travels to many places to find tiny shells. He has been to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He lies on the beach to look for shells to take home. He only collects dead shells and does not take shells with living creatures in them. He explains that many people walk on the beach and break shells, and the sea also breaks them. He believes it is okay to collect shells that are no longer home to any creatures. 
Peter’s argument about collecting shells is strong, especially when you see how beautiful his work is."
FCE_62,B2,"**The Schoolgirl Model**
Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who is a model. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she studies for her school exams. 
One day, I was waiting to meet Kira for an interview. The receptionist told me that Kira would be late. I started to worry. I had read some bad things about models, like they can be difficult or vain. I thought, ""What if she doesn’t come at all?"" But when Kira arrived, she was smiling and friendly. She was with her mother and was wearing a simple black dress and trainers, not fancy clothes. 
Kira explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother looked proud of her. Kira seemed a bit surprised by her fame because it was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter a model competition. Kira said, ""I didn’t want to, but she sent some photos anyway."" When she found out she was a finalist, she was at school. This made her feel confident, and she won the competition easily. After that, a model agency in London offered her work.
Now, Kira has to balance her life as a model and a student. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle, but she says, ""I am still the same person. I am just more confident now.""
Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job. She cannot always make plans with her friends because she doesn’t know what she will be doing. But her friends understand and do not complain.
Kira has the looks and support to have a great career. Not many people can say that before finishing school. At the end of the interview, I asked her what she would like to do if she wasn’t a model. She thought for a moment and said, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""
FCE_49,B2,"**Father and Son Search for Gold**
Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son team. They have traveled from the cold north of Canada to hot Africa looking for gold. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they believe they are very close to finding a lot of gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 years old and from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a little more to find it all.""
The Maddens have spent their lives looking for gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold hidden in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. They read old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth. They chose the best area to explore. After clearing the land, they found pieces of gold in the rocks. They have spent ten years getting permission to work, taking soil samples, and cleaning up old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter deep hole.
Now, they need more money. They have used their savings to chase their dream. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig deeper where the gold is. Chris says it looks difficult, but they have some people to contact for help.
As news spread about their digging, many people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and the locals are hopeful. Peter Woolven, the manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, it could bring more visitors here, but I hope many people do not come and damage the hillside.""
The gold industry in Wales has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen, closed a month ago. Now, more individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. He is 70 years old and said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It is exciting to find hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"**IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and does research about marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.
When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater and is the size of a small car. She dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is very little space. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots."" They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside.
A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and then three hours to come back up. If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out, which goes quickly to the surface.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor on a ship. He explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, they found many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers,"" which are underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water comes out very fast and is very hot.
Rachel felt scared the first time she dived with an American team. They were using equipment when suddenly there was a loud explosion. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was incredible!
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen this."" Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she finally saw them, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by different train times, money, and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" when I got home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. 
All I needed was one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train rocks you to sleep. Carrying all my things in a backpack made me travel simply. I learned to throw away things I didn’t need, like old socks and books. This way of traveling is part of the fun of Inter-Rail. You can forget about rules and just enjoy the trip. 
Having a ticket in my hand made me feel free. This ticket lets young people travel to many countries in one day. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t know how great this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to see more countries. The extra travel didn’t cost us anything. 
We were excited to travel without our parents. We made our own plans and only saw the things that were easy to find. It was a chance to do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We just wanted to enjoy ourselves, like many other Inter-Rail travelers who shared the train with us. 
The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place you only knew by name. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. You can only understand Europe by seeing it yourself. Everyone knows about Europe, but it is different when you experience it. This is why other people’s holiday photos can be boring. 
Traveling by train may not show you new things in the world, but it is a special experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps people see this, even if it doesn’t happen right away."

It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your luggage is missing. You may have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a different place with a different weather and have to wear clothes that are not right for that place.
Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes. It is hard for any airline to promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.
Here is how it works: Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for the luggage to be checked and put on the plane. There is also a minimum time needed to change from one flight to another. This time is often longer to help with luggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause delays. These delays can make it hard for the luggage system to work properly. 
Human mistakes can also happen, like if a label on a bag gets torn off. This can be a bigger problem at large airports, called 'hubs', because many bags are processed there. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, and many of them were changing planes. British Airways had two million passengers changing planes at Heathrow.
Even busy airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have problems. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers quickly change planes to go to Latin America.
To avoid losing your luggage, try to book direct flights when you can and check in early. If you have to change planes, try to use the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight. Make sure to label your luggage with your home address and your holiday address, including your flight numbers.
If your luggage is still missing after all this, you should talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a report about your missing luggage. You need to do this before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"**The Kingfisher**
Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees grow over the stream, giving some shade to the shallow water. The main colors around are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The sound of the water is gentle in the breeze. 
The kingfisher moves quickly and looks like a flash of light. It is there for just a moment, but you remember it because it is so special. Charlie James loved kingfishers when he was young. He feels very strongly about this little bird, but he does not know exactly why. 
In Greek myths, the kingfisher is a bird that was once a moon goddess. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, while its bottom was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this story. Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are made makes them reflect blue light. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or green depending on the light.
Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. They are shy birds, but you can watch them easily from a hiding place. Charlie James's first hiding place was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in just a few minutes and sat very close to him. But it took him four more years to take his first good picture.
Charlie spent a lot of time by a stream where kingfishers lived. However, school took away some of his time with the birds. He missed classes and called himself an ""academic failure."" But people noticed his interest in kingfishers. At 16, he started working as an advisor for a nature magazine. Later, he became an assistant to the editor and then worked as a freelance wildlife cameraman.
Now, Charlie wants to make a special kingfisher film. He wants it to have no words, just beautiful images. He likes to take pictures of the kingfisher's wings. He thinks about the colors of the bird he has loved for many years. His photographs show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows there is much more to his love for the kingfisher than what his work can show."

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked conductor Claudio Abbado if she could watch his practice sessions in Vienna. When an assistant could not come, she helped out. Later, she was asked to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I was not nervous. I always feel good about standing in front of an orchestra."" Anne Manson is from America and works with a famous opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has helped Abbado on many projects.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. He is thankful for the timing: ""If I had won earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. But he finds it hard to shake off the ""competition"" label. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried,"" he says. ""But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting me back. If this does not happen, my career will fall apart.""
**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera and loves the long practice time for opera productions. ""The music needs four weeks of attention,"" she says. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was very important for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She enjoys the complex nature of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to think about the singers' personalities.""
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. He says, ""Conducting surprised me, but I find it very interesting."" He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. People respect my skills as a musician. I learn from every experience I have had, both in music and performing. Now, I will do whatever people ask me to find out what I enjoy.""
**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, which was hard. He had to deal with some musicians who were too relaxed and reading newspapers during the show. ""I was strict with them. I always gave a clear beat and did my best. Many musicians do not seem to need advice from a conductor. But I am not afraid to say what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been nice to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,B2,"**Variations on a Theme**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many in Britain. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was very popular. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, we were tired, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. The only thing we didn’t like was that the park could be more exciting, and the scenery was not great. But the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it! He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, where there are small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We spent six hours there and were happy there were places to rest. The park looked nice, and the staff were friendly. There was something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great trapeze act. We tried the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger kids, Toy Land is very fun. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were happy they were too small for it! The park is so well made that waiting in line is not boring. It was very clean, and the staff were great. One staff member even helped me with one of the girls when I couldn’t sit with both of them.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We got to the park at one o'clock and were sad that it closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit scared of rides, but I had fun too. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the kids were older, they might have thought it was too easy, but they loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. The tallest roller-coaster in Europe, the Rocket, is very big, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters in the air, was worse! There are many main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. The staff were nice to younger kids, but some were not very friendly. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We didn’t want to tell the kids we were going home early."

Five women share their stories about starting a business in the countryside.
A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. ""My customers are my friends,"" she says. Christine moved from London to the countryside when her children were small. She wanted to work from home. She had experience with computers, so her husband suggested she start a computer design business. At first, it was hard and she needed a lot of money. But she was careful with her spending. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evening if she wants. Her business is small, and most customers come to pick up their work.
B. **Maggy Sasanow** designs greeting cards from her home. ""I enjoy being independent,"" she says. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when she moved to the countryside, there were no jobs like that. So, she started her own business and makes 50 different greeting cards to sell to museums. She works in a big room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She does not advertise; her business grows by word of mouth. People send her work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Working alone can be lonely, but she thinks there are more good things than bad.
C. **Delia Turner** makes curtains. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing. In two years, her income went from £24,000 to £80,000. She had six full-time workers, but she had to let them go when the economy got worse. This was hard because it is not easy to find jobs in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. She has to lower her prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.
D. **Tessa Strickland** runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because London was too expensive and she loves the country. She likes being able to work when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at strange hours. The downside is that she needs to be disciplined to close her office door. She publishes children's books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because all her work experience was in London.
E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cake business and a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and has six employees, some of whom work part-time. She started her business at home ten years ago. She is interested in health, so she began making fruit cakes with good quality ingredients. Friends and family asked for cakes, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made. Now, she has a baker and an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. She does not bake anymore; she manages the business. Her biggest challenge has been the financial side because she did not have a lot of money to start."
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very special. The sons are musicians and composers, and their dad makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are teachers from South Wales. They wanted to buy a cello for their son, Paul, who is ten years old. But the cello was very expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He found a school nearby that teaches how to make instruments. He took evening classes for three years.
After making some violins, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says it turned out great. John made another cello for Paul, and he used it until a few months ago. Now, John is a full-time craftsman and makes about twelve violins each year. He even sold one to a famous American musician named Jaime Laredo.
Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers climbing up to play the piano as soon as he could. He tried the violin for a short time but liked the cello more. He thought the cellist in his dad's music group was very cool. So, he took lessons and started playing the cello.
Huw, who is now 22, also plays music. He is a pianist and composer. He says his parents were supportive and did not push him too hard. Instead of feeling jealous of Paul’s success, he wanted to do well too.
Paul has done very well with the cello his dad made. He won a big music competition called the BBC Young Musician of the Year. At just 20 years old, he became the main cellist for the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played with his dad's cello until last year. Now, he has a different cello that is very old and special.
Paul will soon play on television with his new cello in a famous piece called Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says he will play it his own way. However, he cannot watch himself on TV because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw will also be busy because his String Quartet will be played in London at the same time.
John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' music events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,B2,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**
The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust.
Gareth says that a National Trust Warden needs common sense. He also needs to be good with people because he talks to farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies all the time. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. Many people wanted to be the National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula, but Gareth got the job because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand the farmers' problems. He says, ""They can't trick me!"" His farming background also helps him do the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since he started working with the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers when he was young, he liked to pick flowers and collect butterflies. Now, he wonders where he can find those flowers and butterflies. He understands that farming has changed the countryside, but it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following the government's advice.
At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted things done their way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. Gareth says, ""We are close to working together.""
Gareth's job includes conservation, allowing people to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. He wants to finish jobs quickly and without problems. He enjoys seeing projects completed, but he spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.
Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to the public, but some people can be difficult. He says, ""Some people come in, want everything, and then leave as if they own the place. It can be annoying!"" But Gareth believes that common sense is important.
If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But be ready to wait a long time for a job on the Lleyn Peninsula!"

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park.
I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I am focused on my movements and my feet, so I don’t see much else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My life is all about being my best for the World Championships."" She is following a strict schedule to be very fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries taking part. She said, ""We will have support from home, which is very special. It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are playing at home. People expect us to start with a good game.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be fun to play. They are very skilled."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. She said, ""You have to push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But in the Championships, you only have one chance.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You train hard to win. But after the game, we are all friends.""
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is important that we think and train like top players. As captain, I need to have a strong mind and lead by example. I want to support and encourage my team.""
Kendra said, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned carefully. I decided that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents might not see their child's needs until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most regular schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special support that regular schools may not provide. 
Children who are musically talented can benefit from going to a specialist music school. There are five of these schools in Britain. They help children aged seven to eighteen develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. 
At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras, and practice singing. They also practice in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on important subjects like English, math, science, and languages. 
These schools are independent, which means they are not run by the government. The classes are small, so teachers can give more attention to each student. Most children live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be with other children who love music too.
However, there are some problems. The cost is high, around £12,000 to £17,000 a year for students who live at the school. The schools try to help families with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want to send their young children to live at school. The directors of these schools worry about admitting very young children because the environment is strict and intense. They want to help children grow up to be well-rounded individuals.
Sometimes, being in a special music school can be stressful. A child’s musical talent might change as they grow older, and the pressure to succeed can be hard. The schools watch each student closely and offer help when needed. 
Many former students say they learned a lot from the music teaching, but some feel that the focus on music means they do not get enough academic learning. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more in school. 
Because of this, it might be better to wait until a child is older to decide on a specialist music school. Children who are also good at school subjects can do well in regular schools with good music programs. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges, but this may not be possible for families who live far from big cities."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The big garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. There are many colors and shapes in the two long flower beds along the path that goes through the garden. This is because the previous owners loved gardening and left plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny would say some of Susan's ideas were not good, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She says, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it. This might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" But she also enjoys watching how flowers change as they wilt. For example, with tulips, ""You bring them in and put them in water. After a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks.
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they grow well in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they don’t break anything. 
Now, Susan has two art shows to prepare for, and she has a lot of flowers to paint. She has hired an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a regular job. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because it is not good to sleep before work. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like coming back to a messy kitchen in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. Good guests can make her week better, but some weeks are not as good.
Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.
On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for the guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. She clears the breakfast, strips the beds, and gets everything ready for the new guests. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. She takes them to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she talks with friends, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. One day, she worked at the magazine Marie Claire. She said, ""Choosing my clothes was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. I went to a photo studio and then to press previews before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was busy when I could be quietly with an animal. Some people on the fashion team looked stressed, but my job is not stressful. In the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I like seeing how magazines work, but I enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""
Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. She wore leather boots and dark blue trousers, but the zoo gave her a green polo shirt to wear. She got very dirty while petting an elephant. She thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, she felt dirty but had a great day. She said, ""When I stop working in fashion, I could work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Five famous people share their favorite memories of train journeys with Andrew Morgan.
**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to go back as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes along the coast that goes to Italy. It takes you past beautiful views of the sea. It does not matter what the weather is like or what time of year it is; it is always lovely. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and houses in France. You feel like you are looking into the homes of rich and famous people. The people on the train are always lively because there are many tourists and locals, all enjoying the beautiful journey.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which goes across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was too young and was sent to my aunt's house. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still had not traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first big train station I ever saw, and its big glass roof amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am thankful for one train in particular: the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was lovely as we traveled through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after our wedding.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to wait for a day. The driver would often wait for people to arrive. When the train came, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train went through beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream, like traveling on the moon.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but I do not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It was not until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that had a railway in Yorkshire. We filmed on an old train line that volunteers took care of. That is where my love for steam trains began. When we were not filming, we took every chance to ride the train. When I went back last year, everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,B2,"'Want to Get Published?**
If you want to publish your story, expert Margaret Stubbs has some advice for you. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" 
First, you need to research where to send your work. You should learn about publishers and practice your writing skills. Writing well takes time and knowledge. No matter what you write, you need to know about the markets you want to reach. 
One of the best ways to learn is by reading. Go to your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Read many different things to see what publishers are accepting. This information changes often because new magazines and books come out all the time. 
If you want to write short love stories, find magazines that publish them. Get recent copies and read them. Learn what kind of stories they like and who their readers are. The readers want different things, and the editor wants to meet their needs. 
Sometimes, new writers send their stories to me and say, ""This has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I never want to discourage anyone, but it is often true that their work is not ready to be published. Many new writers are too quick to send their work out before it is good enough. 
If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. Most successful writers have worked in publishing or journalism for years before they succeed. 
When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten or twenty more. Each one will be better, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. Your skills and confidence will grow. 
Do not throw away any of your stories; instead, try to improve them. In the beginning, it is best not to show your work to others. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 
Do everything you can to improve as a writer. Look for a creative writing course near you. If you can’t find one, join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence from other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore train station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station did not feel clean and nice like it usually did. Older couples with matching bags filled the benches, and many college students had their bags on the floor.
A man with grey hair was walking around and talking to different people. He looked rich: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but to New York. He thanked her and moved on.
Now, he came to an old lady and asked her if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going to Wilmington. He kept walking to a couple with matching bags. I was curious about him. I was going to Philadelphia too. I thought he could have asked me, but maybe he thought I looked unreliable. He quickly looked at me and then walked to the other end of the waiting area.
He looked stressed. He asked a woman reading a book, ""Please tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up and said, ""Yes, I am."" He asked her for a favor. I stood a little away and pretended to look at my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could see the woman was getting cautious. The man said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!""
They announced my train, and people started moving to Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man began to explain, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning and went home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia. She didn’t know what to do.""
The woman listened sympathetically. I thought it was better to stay quiet and see what he would say next. The man continued, ""I told her to stay at the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport.""
I thought it was strange. If it was such an emergency, why didn’t he go himself? The woman asked, ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" He replied, ""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" I thought this was a weak excuse. 
I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a simple envelope, but a padded one, like a small book. I thought, ""Watch out, lady!"""

John Moore is the owner of a restaurant. He talks about his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary got his chance with cooking, and John got his chance to run a restaurant. When John heard about the restaurant, he quickly went to see it. It was in bad shape, but it was perfect for him.
Running the restaurant made John think of his childhood. His mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad when he was left alone. He wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of the children and helped with the money, while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they talked to the restaurant's customers, which was good for them.
Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. As he grew older, he worked for pocket money. He did small jobs and by ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, earning a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and woke up early. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the adult cooks and sometimes was in charge. He could make over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Recently, Gary started playing the drums and has his own band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. He advised Gary to focus on one thing to be successful. John told him, ""If you want to achieve something, do it by 30. After that, it may be too late.""
At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he finished his work very quickly. He chopped vegetables and sliced meats in just one hour. He even helped other students. Everyone is surprised by how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that if you want something, you must work hard for it because no one gives you anything.
John believes that when you talk to your children, they may only remember a little of what you say. But he thinks Gary has listened and learned from him."
FCE_7,B2,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is to know someone. If you have a friend who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you don’t have any contacts. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. 
Dublin felt very big and new to Jo. She was nervous when she took the train to work there. She didn’t think about why she was going. Everyone at school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to go to new places and have exciting lives. Some of her friends went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo’s mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because many hostels are cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. But Jo didn’t know they were talking about her. She was busy answering an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, “Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.” It was close to her job at the post office and seemed perfect. 
There was no line for this flat because it was looking for a “Third Girl Wanted.” Jo wondered if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf was coming down the stairs. She looked unhappy and said, “This place is terrible. The girls are not nice.” 
Jo asked, “What happened?” The girl replied, “She just acted like she was better than us. We don’t want her here.” Jo continued up the stairs. 
“Hi,” said the girl with “Nessa” on her T-shirt. “Did you see that stuck-up girl?” Jo introduced herself, saying she worked at the post office. Nessa said they were about to have tea and offered Jo a mug. One mug had “Nessa,” one had “Pauline,” and the last one had “Other.” Nessa said, “We can put your name on a mug if you come to stay.”"
FCE_43,B2,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside places, movies, and TV shows. But according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the problems dolphins face.
Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals, they can feel human emotions, and they make us think of freedom in the ocean. We see this love for dolphins in TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest with Darwin. However, these happy images hide the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals are protected by laws and cared for in special areas. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a big disaster for wildlife.
There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and smaller harbour porpoises. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea and are seen in small groups. We do not know much about them. 
Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often found in places like the Channel coast and the Thames River in Britain. Now, they can only be found in a few areas, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress.
It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are going down. Overfishing is taking away a lot of fish from the ocean, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are taken from one area, they may not have enough time to find food in another area. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. 
In modern fishing, large nets are often left in the water or pulled quickly through the sea. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on beaches in France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.
Dolphins can also store waste and harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in dolphins. Female dolphins produce milk that can contain these poisons, which can harm their babies. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s milk.
Another big problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise travels much better than in the air. This noise pollution from ships and oil wells may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced, especially when life feels busy and stressful. Many articles talk about fitness because it is really good for you. 
There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to. Exercise helps your muscles and changes your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit better. It can also stop muscle problems that might cause injuries. Exercise can quickly improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood flow.
You might have heard these reasons many times, so you may not pay attention anymore. But here is something important: exercise can help with feelings of sadness and tiredness. It can also help you sleep better and reduce stress. Exercise can even help with some health problems.
If you are not convinced yet, just think about it: exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can do, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. But remember, if you train too hard or lift too much weight, you might get hurt. Start slowly and carefully. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.
Good posture is very important. It affects how you look and feel. If you slouch, try to imagine that a balloon is pulling the top of your head up. This can help you stand taller and breathe better. Good posture also makes your body look slimmer.
Stretching is also important. It helps you move better and keeps your muscles from getting hurt. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will feel more flexible and fit. Stretching should be a part of your exercise routine, and you should do it slowly and carefully.
The best exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, a good workout, and cooling down afterward."

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is hard to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained a lot for six months. This has caused some problems. Newman said they had to buy a special piece of equipment. This helps Amanda pull him out when their vehicle gets stuck in the mud.
Amanda and Owen have made some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their famous film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, looking for another shy animal, the jackal. This is normal for film-makers. They travel around the world to film interesting wildlife since television started.
I talked to Newman at a safari lodge, where he was meeting other people. He said, ""We do have some arguments, but we get over them quickly."" Neither of them thinks they are the leader. They get along well because they see the animals in the same way. 
When they travel, they set up their tents each night. But now, they have a fixed camp. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before to keep it warm. They eat pre-packed meals that they heat up. Newman said, ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be a bit stressful.""
It can be tough, but being in remote areas lets them get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would go off alone and then come back to greet her family. She even greeted their car as part of her round.
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. Since then, they spend four months in one place to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they must submit a script for approval.
Newman said, ""Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start because we shared the same ideas. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts. If you can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training place. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t see much else. I might notice cars slowing down, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries joining. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are playing at home. People expect us to start well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They are very skilled."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. ""You must push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you only have one chance.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, netball has become harder and faster. ""You train hard to win,"" Kendra said. ""But after the game, we are all friends."" Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explained. As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mind and to lead by example. ""I support and encourage my team.""
Kendra said, ""My netball career has always been planned."" She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and does research about marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.
When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater and is the size of a small car. She dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel says, ""I can touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move. We must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside."" A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.
If there is a problem and she needs to get to the surface quickly, Rachel can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.
Rachel remembers her first dive. She got into the vehicle with an instructor on a ship. He explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space.
Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, are many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. The Russian team was leaving some scientific equipment to study a project that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves. She teaches so she can do her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at one metre per second and is very hot, at 350 degrees.
The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with American scientists. They were towing equipment when there was a loud explosion. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, but nothing happened. They were very relieved to be alive!
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen this."" Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she saw them for real, it was an incredible feeling."

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and the words we say.
Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to get her degree. When she graduated, she felt very confident. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she didn’t want to be late. She believed it was important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think what is inside is important, but in an interview, you should try to look your best.""
Many people forget how important it is to have a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When her boss retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked. She believed she did a good job and that her clothes should not matter.
How we move and use our hands also affects what the interviewer thinks. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to our body language. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion. Her interview went very well, and she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how excited she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She thinks she could have gotten more if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can tell you about the company. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This shows you are interested in the company.
Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long sentences. Successful communicators use short sentences and clear points."""
FCE_36,B2,"**A NEW LIFE**
**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he has a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years. He thought it was fun at first, but then it became boring. He did not plan to leave his job yet, but he lost it suddenly. He did not get a lot of money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. He met a chef from a well-known hotel, and he started selling meat to them. Now, he also sells meat online. He is happy to be out of the office, but he still works a lot, about 80 to 90 hours a week.
**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He started painting as a hobby and found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him. Ron told the counselor that he did not want to go back to his old job, which surprised the counselor. Most people want to find work quickly for money. Ron and his wife moved to the north of England, where they did not know anyone. They left their friends, but they still keep in touch, and many friends visit them.
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat business in her London flat. She enjoyed being a lawyer and made good money, but she worked long hours. She did not want to work more hours to become a senior partner, so she left. Many people thought she would get bored, but she did not. She has deadlines to keep her busy. She feels happier and less stressed now. However, she misses talking to her colleagues. She loves being responsible for her work. If she does a bad job, she knows it is her fault. When she worked for a company, she cared, but now she cares even more because her name is on the products.
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance when he was 22. He liked the excitement but did not find it rewarding. He almost lost his job in 1989, so he decided to leave and travel for a year. During that year, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited gyms and talked to the owners. He knew he needed training to change careers, so he took massage courses. Then, he got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He has no regrets about his choice. He feels more in control of his life now and is very happy."
FCE_6,B2,"**Dedicated to Their Sports**
Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
**A Darius (runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My best moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Sadly, not many people noticed, and I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there with good training facilities and nightlife. But I have to be disciplined. If my friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics - that would be amazing.
**B Gabriel (surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are early in the morning. If I want to succeed, I have to skip late-night parties. I don’t mind too much, but I love sleeping in, and I have to give that up too. But it is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job to present a surfing show on TV. Now, I am a bit of a celebrity.
**C Dieter (yacht racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and celebrate wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we don’t look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so it is nice to come back and hang out with my friends. You can’t always focus on sports; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but not many people recognize me on the street. I don’t want to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from fans who want signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.
**D Tomas (tennis player)**  
It feels great to walk on the court and hear the crowd cheer for me. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many people around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. But it has some problems too. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports; you need to be serious and professional. I focus on my game now and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t buy everything, and when I say yes, I feel bad for buying unhealthy food. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices. I can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a good place for this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things. Parents worry about how much sugar is in food, but children are influenced by the fun ads they see on TV.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel they are competing with ads and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow ads to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks about food with her children, and now her son thinks ads are not good. ""We don’t have many problems in the supermarket now because my children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We don’t buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce problems between parents and children by moving sweets away from the checkout areas or by having play areas for children. Even if parents spend less money without their children, shopping without their demands would likely bring in more customers."
FCE_20,B2,"**The Merrion Hotel: Luxury and Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.
Peter MacCann is the General Manager. He wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first visit, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal temperature of 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature between 14°C and 25°C.
The hotel is also good for business guests. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the guests will be business travelers. To help them, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for new improvements. They have added extra cables for future technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models when needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and cozy bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has designed a new kitchen and improved the restaurant. The hotel benefits from having a great place to eat without financial risks.
With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_40,B2,"**Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women how they get their energy in life.
A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I like to do things that are challenging. When I learn something new, I feel very energetic. I also love rhythm. Right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. Dancing is great; it makes me feel alive. If I am bored, I feel tired. Doing something useful, even a little, gives me energy.""
B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I love my job, so it does not feel hard. If you like what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need a good amount of sleep. When I sleep six hours a night, I feel a bit tired. I know exercise gives me energy, but it can be hard to find the energy to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to exercise at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""
C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat very healthily for energy. I think my energy comes from being positive and excited. I don’t like negative people. I believe we should enjoy life. It is important to achieve things and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many young and lively people, which makes me happy. I enjoy taking photos, even if I’m not the best at it. I also write words for fun songs when I travel.""
D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do, both at work and with my family. Being positive helps me. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Energy is like a natural feeling that comes from talking to others. Just smile at someone and see how good it feels when they smile back. I try to eat healthy food and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a special exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""
E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is making a garden from nothing. I once turned a concrete area into a garden by breaking the concrete and adding soil. It was better than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing gives me energy too. I also like to explore private lands, and if I get caught, I say I didn’t know it was private. I enjoy it because it feels fun and childlike.""
F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe you should care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do makes me tired. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like how they took my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for what is most important to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. 
In the early 1900s, skating was seen as stylish. But in the 1924 Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie showed a new, more athletic way to skate. This made skating very popular. Today, skating combines art and sport. It is both beautiful and hard work.
For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. The way you hold your body helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and lean a little forward. Relaxing is very important when you skate. 
To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It is not too hard! If you keep practicing, you can make bigger movements as you get better.
Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should know. Even the best skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This helps you not get hurt when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.
Once you can skate confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and skating in pairs. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basics and then teach you turns, jumps, and spins.
If you watch good skaters, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To skate well, you should practice exercises regularly. It can be dangerous to skate if your body is stiff. Warm-up exercises should include stretching your legs, back, and shoulders, especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also helps your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. When combined with swimming or jogging, skating is a great way to stay healthy and fit."
FCE_64,B2,"**Trills and Bills**
Seeing a talented child win a medal can make you very happy. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives.
A. **Annika Reeder, 15**  
Annika won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I am very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes you stiff.""
B. **Annika's Mother**  
""Annika showed great talent from a young age. I have seen some parents push their children, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy. You have to want to do it yourself. People say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was very shy, but now she has met people from all over the world and is more confident.""
C. **Sarah Stokes, 12**  
Sarah started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s good that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love it! Even if my parents weren’t there, I would still do it because I am very determined. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. **Sarah's Mother**  
""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she loved it. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is very organized and happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
E. **Jane McShane, 10**  
Jane is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t want to feel embarrassed.""
F. **Jane's Mother**  
""Jane played her first chess game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. I was bored when my father tried to teach me, but Jane loved it right away. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. I am happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is so talented. If she has this gift, I want her to use it."""
FCE_29,B2,"
It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is 2.28 meters tall and is the tallest man in Britain.
Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are getting better nutrition now, which is helping us grow taller. Professor Chris Stringer says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again,"" who lived 40,000 years ago.
For most of human history, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and berries, while men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Now, most of the world's land is used for farming. Three main plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our food today. This simple diet has hurt our health. 
In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn was not good for health, according to some experts. But farming spread because one piece of land could feed many more people than hunting could. 
Today, many people are still not well-nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets getting better again. Now, the average man in the US is 1.79 meters tall, in Holland 1.80 meters, and in Japan 1.77 meters. This is good news, but there are still problems. 
Even though people are getting taller, beds have not changed in size since 1860. Also, there is less space for legs in planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often. 
The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. Some scientists think we might reach a height of 1.93 meters this century. But there is a twist. While some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, we might be getting shorter. 
10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, people were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even with good food. As the planet gets hotter, we might get even shorter. So, our growth could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,B2,"**Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of making television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think studio audiences are not important. They say that even people who work in TV do not respect them. I thought studio audiences were just made up of silly people who want to be on TV for a moment. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds and jobs. TV shows try to attract different types of people for different programs.
Many people who watch TV at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on TV for a second. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said, ""I came for a chance to be on TV.""
Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket."" Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when you see them. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""We believe a good show does not need these signs.""
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" I missed seeing the live actors because I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a monitor.
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch TV, but that is not what matters. For most people in the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,B2,"**Favourite Places**
**Bruce**  
I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing, which I later became known for.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive than regular tickets. The views are not amazing. The train goes over Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I love - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding chairs. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer and find new things.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors just enjoy the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open moorland, perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is a quiet and empty place, and I like the feeling of space. I found this area by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never come back. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**
We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was very excited because she found a pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank to keep animals for a short time. 
I got home late. I quickly put a pot on the stove to boil. Suddenly, I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. The problem was with our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca. I got Bianca as a Mother's Day gift. 
Domino was running around the room with the mouse in his mouth. He wanted to escape with his catch. I jumped into the room but tripped and fell on the floor. I saw the snake escaping from the table and slithering on the floor. 
The snake was moving while the kids and the cat were jumping around, making a lot of noise. The dog was barking too. The pot in the kitchen boiled over, and I ran to turn it off. I came back with more energy. I grabbed Domino by the tail and saved the mouse from him. 
Later, I looked at the snake. I wanted to catch it, but it was hard. I sat on the floor and tried to calm the snake down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body. I carefully lifted the snake and walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to let it go near a tree. 
When I finally let go of the snake, it surprised me. Instead of running away, it climbed up on my shoulders like a warm scarf. We stood there together, with my four children and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not."" 
I asked the kids to help me encourage the snake to move. Slowly, it went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake left, my three-year-old son, Clay, sighed and said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"**Drop Me a Line!**
In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is becoming rare. But for me, getting a letter is special. There is excitement when it arrives, joy in seeing who sent it, and happiness in reading it.
I have written letters for a long time. It started with little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I was 18 and moved to London to study medicine, I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote too, and I loved his funny letters. Most letters from home talked about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we wrote to each other. Writing letters helped our relationships. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than by talking. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it is even better to get a lot of news in a letter! I especially like letters in airmail envelopes with pretty stamps.
I get letters from friends in different countries. One friend is Mangala from Sri Lanka, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. There is also a lady from France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant after a holiday. If I had not asked for her address, I would not have been able to write to her. Luckily, she replied, and now we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her because she does not speak English. We have visited her home twice, and she has stayed with us.
My best letter-writing story is from this summer. My family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that we kept in touch for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about us!
I am happy that my children are also writing letters. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, set up by my penfriend. I really hope that letter writing does not become a lost art."
FCE_54,B2,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**
Many ancient pictures carved into rocks in France are being damaged. There are about 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego, in the French Alps. Scientists are worried that these drawings will not last for future generations. The mountain has drawings that are 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. 
More and more tourists are visiting the site, but some are ruining the pictures with graffiti. Jean Clottes, who leads the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think these pictures will always be here. But if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists walking on the drawings and damaging them. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock as souvenirs. 
When tourists cannot take a good photo, they rub the drawings to make them clearer. The weather has already polished the drawings, and when the sun shines, some people rub them to see them better. Some visitors bring sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.
Experts have different ideas about how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way to save the site is to make it a ""no-go"" area. This would mean only guided tours could visit. He believes that if we do not protect the site, it will be destroyed, and important research will stop. 
But Clottes disagrees. He thinks de Lumley’s idea is too strict and will upset local people. He says, ""The site is a historic monument, and we must do everything we can to save it."" 
David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""De Lumley’s idea is not the best. We want people to see the site, but it is hard to stop damage because it is so big. We may need to charge a fee to help pay for guards."" 
Annie Echassoux, who has studied the site, is worried that as it becomes easier to reach, more damage will happen. She believes the best solution is to close off parts of the area and have guides. ""We need money to protect this historic site,"" she says. ""If we do not act, we will lose these drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t buy everything, and when I say yes, I feel bad for giving them junk food. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry they are missing out on learning to make choices. I just can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million is spent on advertising for children every year, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big place for this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things. Parents worry about how much sugar is bad for teeth, but children are influenced by the fun ads they see.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to say no to their children because of ads.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks to her children about food, and now her son thinks ads are not good. ""We don’t have many problems in the supermarket now because my children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We don’t buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce problems between parents and children by moving sweets away from the checkout areas or by having play areas for children. Even if parents spend less money without their children, the idea of shopping without their kids asking for things might bring in more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"**Going Up the Wall**
Climbers used to go to the mountains to climb. Now, people can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. High above them on a climbing wall is a French climber named Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham. This place is also known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall.
In the past, climbers practiced on cliffs. They climbed in places with good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and stay busy.
Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls. These walls were made with special bricks that climbers could hold on to. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He put natural rock in concrete to create a climbing wall.
In the 1970s, many climbing walls were built in sports halls, but they had problems. The walls were straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers got bored of the same routes.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that looked like the shapes on cliffs. This material could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to make climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so they could build overhanging walls easily. This new system gave climbers many different holds to use."
FCE_61,B2,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**
If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they might say it is a risky choice. Acting is a risky job because there are many actors but not enough roles for them. When you decide to be an actor, some friends may think you are crazy, but others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. 
Becoming an actor is a personal choice. You are responsible for your own dreams. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no tests to pass, and finishing your training does not guarantee you will get a job. Success depends on luck and talent. 
There is a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding. Many people want to know what talent is. I think talent is a mix of natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person’s courage and belief in what they do.
Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to perform. 
If you ask successful actors how they did it, they might not know. They understand some things about their skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they must keep working hard because their fame can change quickly. 
Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been without work, doing other jobs. Then, you may get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often do not talk about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to deal with the stress of competition and rejection. 
No one likes to be rejected. This possibility is there from the moment you start auditioning. You are saying you are ready and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care enough, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is 2.28 meters tall, making him the tallest man in Britain.
Every ten years, people in Europe get about one centimeter taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are getting better nutrition now, which is helping us grow taller. Professor Chris Stringer says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again,"" who lived 40,000 years ago.
For most of human history, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and berries, while men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Now, most of the world's land is used for farming. Three main plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give more than half of the food we eat today. This limited diet has hurt our health. 
In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn was not good for health, but farming spread because it could feed more people than hunting. Many people are still not well-nourished, but some countries like the US, Japan, and those in Europe are starting to eat better again. 
Now, the average man in the US is 1.79 meters tall, in Holland 1.80 meters, and in Japan 1.77 meters. This is a good change, but there are still problems. Beds have not gotten longer since 1860, and there is less space in planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often. 
The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. Some scientists think we might reach a height of 1.93 meters this century. But there is a twist. While some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, we might actually be getting shorter. 
10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, people were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even with good food. As the planet gets hotter, we might shrink even more. So, our growth could be affected by global warming."

FCE_5,B2,"**A Winning Game**
Two brothers are using their childhood game to make money. Dave and Norm Lagasse are in their forties and live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are playing a game called pichenotte, which they say is special. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought this game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family played pichenotte every weekend and holiday. Dave remembers, ""We had the best time ever.""
When the family moved to New Mexico, they still played pichenotte with the board their grandfather made from old wooden crates. Visitors were curious because no one in southern USA knew this game. Three years ago, Dave saw that their old board was damaged, so he made a new one. His family and friends wanted to buy it. 
One night, the brothers took a new board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people thought it was a silly game, but soon they wanted to play! When people asked about the game’s history, Dave learned that it might have started in India with a game called 'carroms.' This game changed into 'squails' in Britain, and British people brought it to Canada. The French-Canadian version is called pichenotte.
Pichenotte can be played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces, called 'pucks.' They flick the pucks across a round board with their fingers. If a puck goes into a small hole, it is worth 20 points. There are also rings worth 15, 10, and 5 points, and eight small posts that are obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.
Seeing how much people liked the game at the bar, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. Many people came to buy them, and soon there were pichenotte championships with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup.' The brothers sold boards quickly and decided to make pichenotte their full-time job. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12 kg, and is 1 cm thick. Norm says, ""They are very strong and last a long time.""
The boards cost $595 each and can be bought from the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope to make a lot of money from their game. For now, they enjoy playing pichenotte in their free time."
FCE_41,B2,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE
When you enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a flat piece of land covered in weeds. For a long time, people thought it was useless land. One man, with the help of his wife, worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful village you see today. 
Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into a nice landscape. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was done by hand. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. Hundreds of trees and bushes were also planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they needed to survive near the sea and strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims had the idea for the Model Village. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, wood, and plastic to last in all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about the materials, but soon he became an expert himself. 
You will see that all the models are made to the same scale and have many small details. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality. The methods used here have been used in other model villages in England and even in some college courses about modeling.
All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, which is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest part of the village.
Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models. If you touch them, it can take us a long time to fix them. You can take photos from the paths only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.
To make your visit more fun, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village more interesting. We also want to know if any models need to be fixed. 
We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers print pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules that newspaper editors should follow. Sometimes, pop stars take pictures with paparazzi, but this is not common. Usually, it hurts people in the public eye when their private moments are shown on the front page. Very few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to help with these problems. Most of the time, these pictures are not important for the public. For example, does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help solve a crime? The actress has complained about such pictures before. Since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is a problem that the PCC did not start an investigation. 
The PCC should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these bad stories? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers would report this, and it would be on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected and might not be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore.
If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be some problems. How would they decide to start an investigation? Should they ask the person who was hurt to make a complaint? If that person does not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Celebrities might expect the PCC to look into every story about them and be upset if they do not. The PCC would have a very big job. How could they watch all the newspapers in Britain, including local ones and magazines? 
There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone’s privacy is invaded, would they want to go through an investigation? Many people just want to forget about it and move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they do not want to become public if they complain. In this way, the PCC could also become a problem for them.
One British comedian had a bad experience with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, and he did not complain later when a photographer took pictures of him and his family on holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would use the pictures again and make a new story about his anger. They thought it was just a joke because he is a comedian. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

Instead, we focus on those who are ready to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and have an idea of what you want to do.
What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to specialize in one area, move up to a job with more responsibility, or change to a different field. Whatever you choose, be careful when picking your second job. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years.

Confident people seem like they were born that way, but many say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very scared, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that confidence is about believing in yourself. If work is too much, I don’t feel guilty if I leave some tasks for the next day. When I face something hard, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to calm down.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to look confident because it is important in my job on TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. My mother gave me good advice when I was a teenager. She said, “Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves.” I remember this often. I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.
**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work, but I built this confidence over time. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident. I work hard and people like me, but not everyone does. That’s okay. You need to like yourself and not worry about what others think. My company offers training courses, which help me feel better about myself. It is good to set small goals so you can see your progress.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary. I would sit in meetings and not always agree, but I was too scared to speak. Eventually, I found the courage to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public before and I was very nervous. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day.” I also wrote down some notes to help me. I think everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,B2,"**Visit to Malaysia**
Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional. If the line breaks, finders keepers... and I have many more."" He showed me a pile of beautiful kites at his feet. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival.
In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A line of nervous competitors held the lines of their kites and waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person had four different kite designs. The kites were judged on how they looked, how stable they were in the air, and how well they flew.
""Flying kites isn't hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Come to my house, and I will show you how to make one."" I got five invitations that day, and I decided to go to his house. There, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers in a big, nice room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help him fix his kite, but I could not. Instead, I drove to the southern part of the state, heading towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with thick rainforests.
I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started walking, I should have known that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I met a man named Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects under my thin mattress. 
At night, it was very dark, and I heard many sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many creatures were moving around. In the morning, I saw a great view of five green mountain ranges. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning hit the trees. I got soaked. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car getting washed away and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill.
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I will remember it more for the kindness of the people."

During the Easter holidays, children can join a fun quiz about surprises. You can get free quiz sheets at the desk by the Orange Street entrance. The quiz will take you to 14 surprising paintings, and you will answer different questions about them. The quiz sheets will be available from 25 March to 9 April during normal gallery hours.
**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by the Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings like this in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is normal for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. You can see it in Room 25.
**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until 31 May.
**Lecture News**  
There are lectures every Wednesday to go with the special exhibition. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will talk about Melendez. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will discuss Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists tell stories through their pictures.
**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery is happy to say that the restaurant has improved and expanded. With new kitchens, the restaurant now offers many hot and cold dishes at good prices.
**Information for Visitors**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery happen every day at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (except Sundays). These tours show some of the Gallery's best pictures and the important European paintings from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."
PET_24,B1,"**Little Chefs**
A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make good food.
Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.""
Flora is twelve years old. She has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. At first, I was happy at home and didn't want to go. But now, I am really glad I came.""
Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen is not always clean when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, they will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_13,B1,"**Outdoor Centre Fees**

PET_21,B1,"MONEY
What is money? Money can be a pound, a dollar, or a franc. It is like a gram or a kilometre, but you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that does not cost much to make.
A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, traded corn he grew for honey from Mr. Hive. This was a trade between two people who wanted what the other had.
Over time, many societies created their own types of money, called currencies, so people could trade more easily. Now, most countries use a national currency."
PET_46,B1,"**Write a Winning Story!**
You can win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story printed in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other people will win £100. We need good stories from writers. The judges are Mary Littlejohn, a novelist, Michael Brown, a TV reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing. They want interesting and original stories.
Last year, detective stories were very popular, but the winner wrote a love story. You can write about anything you like. Here are some tips to help you:
1. **Write About What You Know**: Write about things you understand. Last year, many stories were about love, family, and problems with friends. Make ordinary situations interesting so people want to read more.
2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your information is correct. If you describe a place or explain something, it must be right. Don’t write about things you are not sure about.
3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A bad ending can ruin a good story. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the end.
4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real. Use good words to describe them.
Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and on one side of the paper only. We cannot accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. We cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.
You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country. The story must not be printed or recorded anywhere in the world. You need to pay a fee of £5 to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to us.
The closing date is 30 July, and we will tell the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story printed in our magazine."
PET_3,B1,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST
Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many years, she was the only woman scientist in history books. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he made sure she got a good education. This was special because most women at that time could not study much.
Hypatia studied in Athens and Rome. After that, she went back to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have her books, but we know she wrote important works about math. Hypatia also liked technology and created some scientific tools to help her work.
At that time, many leaders were afraid of science, and people who worked with it were in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,B1,"**Grass**
Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 types of grass, and they grow in every part of the earth. Grass can live in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. 
Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to survive. 
Grass grows back very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new grass grows from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so there is always food for them."
PET_44,B1,"Kal Kaur Rai is a young woman who loves fashion. She just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she liked to draw clothes and create designs. She never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her job. She thought they wanted her to have a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.
After university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She went to many events but could not buy the expensive clothes she wanted. So, she started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make some for them too. 
Kal found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs. The clothes were very popular, and none of them came back. This made her feel confident, so she decided to leave her advertising job. She took a loan of £20,000 to start her own women's clothing brand. 
Kal's parents were happy for her and said they would support her. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000. Her designs are in fashion magazines, and she creates clothes for pop stars. Winning this award has made her well-known. 
Kal feels very lucky. She says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,B1,"**Sunningdale Hotel**
The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has given great service to many people from all over the world. In the last 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed here.
The hotel is on a main road that goes to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the center by bus. Many buses stop outside the hotel, but guests should not take the blue buses with the sign ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is also an underground station less than 100 meters away.
The hotel has 200 comfortable single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the hall. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. Guests can park their cars in the hotel parking area. Daily newspapers are free, and guests can buy stamps at the office.
Guests who stay for a long time must pay for their room every week in advance. They need to tell the hotel one week before they leave. Both short and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first.
Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. If guests are studying or working late, they can ask for dinner until 11 pm by writing their name on a list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 choices for breakfast and dinner.
No animals or fires are allowed in the hotel. Guests should be quiet, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If guests arrive by train, it is best to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main train station."

Tom Cruise is a very successful actor. But his life was not always easy. When he was a young boy, Tom was shy and had trouble making friends. He liked to be in school plays, though. 
After finishing high school, Tom went to New York to find a job. He worked as a porter and also took drama classes. In 1980, a film director named Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. 
Ten years later, Tom became very successful. He was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood and made millions of dollars for each film. Today, Tom still acts in movies and has many fans all over the world."

PET_49,B1,"**The Ghan Train**
Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cooler south. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late.
In the 1920s, there was a plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide by train. They built a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but floods often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished a few months before Mark's trip. The train can go up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday.
The Ghan was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia by train would save time and money. The Ghan is said to be the world's first north-south railway.
When Mark waited to get on the Ghan, he saw that everyone was excited for the trip. Many of the passengers were older Australians. The first stop was Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip there. Mark did not get off until Alice Springs, where he went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so they just walked around it and watched the sunset.
From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, they reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's journey was over. Even if the train did not meet all the promises, it took him to some amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,B1,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**
Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is the highest mountain in Britain, and it can be very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first climb on Ben Nevis.
It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to a place called Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high, which is probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the ""Carries,"" which are big bowls in the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is very hard, like ice.
Even though some people in my group were very experienced, we took a lot of safety equipment. This included lights to get help, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started climbing. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard.
The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest person in the group, so I had to take more breaks. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I got to them, they started climbing again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb.
After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge. It is only 1.5 meters wide, and the mountain drops down hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. But we were not lucky because a mist came down.
Getting back down to camp can be just as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn can lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I really enjoyed the climb when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top!"
PET_58,B1,"**Anna's New School**
This week has been very exciting because we moved into our new school building! It is a great place. The builders used wood to make it, just like our old school. But this school is special because it is good for the environment. 
The school took a long time to build. We watched the builders clear the land where the school would be. It was exciting, but it also meant that some nice land was gone. The building machines were very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building would never be finished.
Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the old school next door, which was very old. We also share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We can’t wait to use them when our new sports field is ready.
When you enter the school, you will see that there are no heaters! The heat comes from all of us inside - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside. If we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!
You will also notice that there is a tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to see it yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that we can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on our website.
Even though we are using the school now, some parts are still being finished. For example, we are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

PET_2,B1,"A month ago, I did not know that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and having fun. Now, I looked down at the river far below me and understood why people like rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place where we stayed was not great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.
Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock-climbing. Then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."
PET_23,B1,"**Letter to the Newport Evening News**
On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I lost it, it was too late. I didn’t know what to do. I am 72 years old, far from home, and I felt very worried. I stood by the road and cried.
A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He said they found my handbag and would bring it back to me.
I got my handbag back, and everything was inside and safe. I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. I really appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,B1,"**Sharks**
Sharks are some of the most scary animals in the ocean. They are very good at finding food underwater because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.
Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they do not sleep much. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is helpful for scientists who study sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting animals."

PET_53,B1,"'Joining the Kirov Ballet
My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and then they started talking to me in English, so we could understand each other.
Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers better. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mom stayed with me. When she left, I felt a little sad. One night, I called her because I felt lonely.
The ballet classes in Russia are much harder than in England. I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This helps me perform well in class. In the evenings, I watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish.
Now that I am used to living here, I feel at home. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was warm for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.
Right now, we are getting ready for a new show, and there is a competition for young dancers that I will enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,B1,"**THE ICEHOTEL**
For many years, people visited the Arctic in summer to see the land of the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there, and they enjoyed the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people decided that the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. 
In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an exhibition in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, on the frozen Torne River. This building was called Arctic Hall, and many visitors came to see it. One night, some guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel started.
Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world. When winter starts, a team of builders, architects, and artists from many countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As they finish one part, it opens for visitors and guests, while they continue to build other parts. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is finished. 
The ICEHOTEL is built outside, using snow and ice, so the finishing date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, even if it is very cold outside. Guests get warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves included in their stay. It is also a good idea to bring sweaters, scarves, and thick socks. Guests should wear shoes that are a bit bigger than normal to fit the thick socks.
If you want to visit the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and other things on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be in your room when you arrive. The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,B1,"**Shopping for Furniture**
A report by Dave Worthington
Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday but had to close very quickly. Up to 6,000 people came to the shop. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop usually opens from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but it said it would stay open for 24 hours at first. However, it had to close just half an hour after opening. A police officer said that they knew a lot of people would come, but the crowd was not patient. The shop became very full, and the managers decided to close the doors. 
People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait in line. There was also a long line of cars trying to park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop, which blocked the road.
One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn’t have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. They had to close for safety. I will come back when they reopen, but I don’t want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,B1,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**
Tanya Streeter is a free-diver who holds four world records. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep without help. She held her breath for over three and a half minutes. This made her the first woman to break a world record that was held by a man.
A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive to keep her safe. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya believes safety and training are very important. 
Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya trains the same way for all her events. She spends two-thirds of her training in the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart stronger. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit.
When Tanya practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her to not get tired, or it could ruin her training.
When she is not training, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research and making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, where she loved to swim and explore the sea life.
Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is famous in some countries, people listen to her when she talks about environmental issues. In the future, Tanya, who is now in her thirties, wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and plans to continue for many more years."
PET_12,B1,"CARTOON FILMS
Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for everyone. 
In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for children. But then, some directors had new ideas. They showed that cartoons can be fun for both adults and children. 
However, not all cartoon films were successful. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well. It was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and soon, film companies started to make a lot of money again."
PET_26,B1,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role. 
""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university making a TV show called The Finnegans. I had only acted in school, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother said I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. 
Before university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me to say they were going to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. 
Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to write the essays I missed. I didn’t tell my friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel so lucky. 
After university, I want to be an actor. I am not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I have not received any offers yet. I don’t know how I did it all because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I didn’t know what to do. I have since acted in two college plays. 
Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I am going to Greece for the summer with friends."""
PET_8,B1,"When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, I just wanted to make enough money to feed my children. Now, 'The Body Shop' is a big company that is growing fast all over the world. Since we started, I have learned many things. I want to share what I have learned in this book. I believe we can run a successful business without losing our values. 
This is not a normal business book, and it is not just about my life. The main idea is that to be successful in business, you need to be different. Business can be fun, and it can be run with love. It can also help people. In business, like in life, I want to enjoy what I do, feel like I am part of a family, and be excited by new things. I want the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. 
Now, this book shares my ideas with everyone. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."

PET_30,B1,"HONEY
Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can fly very far, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey usually tastes milder than darker honey.
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey a lot and used it as payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve sports performance. Honey is not just food; it can also help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,B1,"**Norwich**
Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. It has been a place to live for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, when the Normans invaded, it became one of the largest towns in England. 
Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and celebrated its 900th birthday recently. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city and got the right to govern itself.
Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. But in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It grew for 300 years and became rich. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. 
Norwich has many things to do, like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, and good restaurants. There is also a football team called 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow. 
One new attraction is a shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, there was a big hole in the city while builders worked on it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and many trees. The people of Norwich are happy that the old open market is still there, next to the new shopping centre. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a nice mix of old and new."
PET_43,B1,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**
Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, becomes very colorful. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, which happens every year for nine days. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons that took off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries are expected to come.
**What to See**
The pilots talk to each other using radios. They all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great time to take beautiful photos. To see the ""glows,"" you should arrive just after night falls or before 5:30 am. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are different sizes and colors, and some look like animals or cartoon characters. Kids will enjoy this!
In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies that offer this. Another option is to take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride, and you can see the festival from above.
There are many other fun things to do for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.
**The Albuquerque Box**
This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This helps skilled pilots control where their balloons go.
**Practical Advice**
Buy your tickets online before the festival to avoid long lines. Wear several layers of thin clothes because it can be cool at night and in the morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and don’t forget your camera. If you use film, make sure to have high-speed film for evening and night photos."
PET_51,B1,"The Eden Project
The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is a very popular place for tourists. When you first see it, the big 'biospheres' look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. They show how important plants are for people.
Many things we use every day come from plants. For example, we get wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate from plants. There are over 135,000 types of plants grown at the Eden Project. 
Even if it is cold outside, electric heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. There is also a zone that looks like the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. Soon, they will build a desert zone too."
PET_11,B1,"Some people have said they do not like this year's book, New Writing 3, but I do not understand why. It has 500 pages of good writing for only £6.99, which is great! Most of the book is fiction, with parts of novels and short stories. There are nice stories by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. 
Interestingly, many of the less famous writers wrote about food. I suggest you do not read Jane Harris's story, Those Nails, right after eating. It has some very unpleasant scenes that might make you feel sick! 
There are also poems from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can find parts of novels that are not finished yet by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a little non-fiction, including a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers, and a surprising piece by Ursula Owen about herself. 
This is a great collection, and I am excited to see what next year's book will be like!"

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when you learn about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some eager five-year-olds.
When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts one hour, every two weeks. Also, each student has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons.
From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have played for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to make great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and learn the violin in a more traditional way."
PET_56,B1,"**Moonshine**
The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. The CD is called ""Here Again"" and it comes after their last CD, ""The Waves."" There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott is now playing the bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined the band as the drummer.
The first song on the CD is a dance song. This shows that the band is not going to focus on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder. Most of the other songs are in the band’s usual slow style. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. They could easily become popular because they are very good.
The singer, Rob Letchford, shows how talented he is by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be happy he recorded these songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. But fans who bought tickets do not need to worry. The concerts will be rescheduled when Rob gets better.
On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from slow songs to dance songs that make you want to move. However, I think they put their best songs at the beginning, and the last few songs are not as good. Still, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, it was found by land, not by sea.
In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But the people who became rich were not the ones looking for gold. The richest people owned banks and law firms, and they built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.
Today, many tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some even take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It tells us about everyday life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys writes about important news, like sickness, an enemy navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also talks about himself, including his mistakes - he often slept in church or looked at pretty girls.
He describes his home life, like a fight with his wife and how they made up, and he worries about her being sick. Pepys liked books, music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. He was a busy man with many important jobs - he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work with the British Navy."
PET_33,B1,"**The History of Shoes**
A long time ago, people did not think about shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins. People tied these skins around their ankles to keep warm. 
Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton. This depends on what is popular at the time. 
About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. 
In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines helped the shoe industry make many shoes quickly and at lower prices for more people."
PET_20,B1,"**No Title**
When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running and feel good about themselves. So, I started a running club for women in my area. I was upset because many race organizers say there are not enough women in running, but they do not help by giving women their own changing rooms.
I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. Many wanted to lose weight, but I don’t think they thought about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined it was hard and painful. They didn’t see that running can be fun, with chatting and smiling in nice places, like by a river.
At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes! They also learned about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and it makes me very happy to see how much they have improved. They enjoy it too!"
PET_40,B1,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**
In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people came to Alaska to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means ""far, distant place."" In 1909, Iditarod became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.
In summer, boats could bring supplies to the towns. But in winter, rivers and the ocean froze, and it was hard to deliver things. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at ""roadhouses"" to sleep and eat.
The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes became the main way to travel. But in 1925, there was a big problem. A disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot was away, so they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.
The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty dog teams made the journey in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian looking for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo, who was very good at finding the way in the snow. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped the team from falling into icy water. Because of this, the diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.
Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the same route as in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""

The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Swedish Lapland. In winter, the temperature can be very cold, reaching -40 degrees Celsius. Every year, 6,000 tourists visit this special place. It is home to Europe’s most unusual hotel. 
In this hotel, you eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made of ice. You can even have a wedding there! The bar is made of ice too, so it is not a good idea to put hot drinks on it. The bedrooms are about -4 degrees Celsius, but guests get special sleeping bags to keep warm. If you need warm clothes, the hotel can provide them.
The Ice Hotel is never older than six months because it melts in summer. Each winter, workers rebuild it. They use 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow to create the hotel."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on a boys' football team in Mozambique. They played in a local competition and won. Maria said, ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" 
A local newspaper wrote about her story. Jose Craveirinha, who helped other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her playing football. He noticed she was very fast. He talked to her about athletics, but Maria did not understand. She only knew about football. 
Jose bought her running shoes and took her to train. It was hard work, and her legs hurt. He also spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful. They agreed to let him help her train. 
In 1991, Maria went to train in the United States. At first, she did not want to go because she would miss her family. The girls she met in the US were different from her. Maria said, ""They were good athletes, but I worried about my parents having enough to eat. They worried about dresses and make-up."" 
Maria felt lucky to be in the US. The trainers were great, and she learned a lot. Today, Maria still runs and lives happily in South Africa with her mother for most of the year."

The Grand Canyon is in the United States. It was made by the Colorado River. Many people visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and see the view. The view is very beautiful, and it is even better with the Skywalk. 
The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass, so you can see the lovely rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. The Skywalk opened in 2007, and many people have visited it since then. 
When you walk on the Skywalk, you must wear special covers on your shoes. This is to protect the glass. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air, like a bird."

In Vancouver, you can enjoy the water and the mountains. You can even go skiing just 15 minutes by car from the city.
In the past, thirty trains left Vancouver every day to travel across the country. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still very exciting. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you will see the beautiful views at night."

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years. The first big zoo was in China and was called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals in zoos were trained to perform for visitors, but this does not happen anymore. Now, zoos are places where people can see animals acting naturally.
Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. Some people think zoos are good because they help us learn about nature and see wild animals up close. They believe these things would not be possible without zoos.
However, some people do not like zoos. They think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also say that in some zoos, animals live in dirty places and do not get good food."

By Katie Atkins, aged 14  
I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from other high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, while others wore bright T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all good at playing music, especially for our age. Each band even made up new songs on stage. It was exciting to watch, but it was even better when my band played!  
My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to play get in. However, anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps in different parts of the country. I have been to a few and learned a lot.  
Many adults are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not challenging enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can create your own music, but you also feel part of its history, like the great jazz musicians before us.  
My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we would not be able to improve our music!"

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. However, it does not rain often. When it does rain, the water pipes in the city cannot handle the sudden floods, and the streets become like rivers. Many winters have been dry, so when it rains, the people are very happy.
The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not depend on rain. They get water from underground channels that were built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year round. Places that are mostly dry but get water this way are called oases.
If you travel south from Marrakesh, you will reach Skoura. In Skoura, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels, and people use these squares to grow food. The Atlas mountains, which are covered in snow in winter, make a beautiful background."

Gareth Ellis is 13 years old. He is the youngest son of Alan, who is an engineer, and Kath, who is a nursery teacher. Gareth has two older brothers who work in banking and computers. But Gareth has always wanted to be a clown. 
Three years ago, Gareth and his parents joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it's true. Gareth wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three years old."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to find full-time jobs in the circus. They both got jobs with a famous circus, and Gareth started training to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo. 
During the summer, they travel with the circus and go home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away. Kath says, ""It was not easy. We had a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a small caravan to sleep in, and we left our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""
Gareth talks about his education. He says, ""People ask about my school, but wherever we go, someone always comes to teach me. I use the same books as my friends at school, and I have a computer. I have never fallen behind my classmates."" 
What about the future? Kath says, ""It was a hard choice, but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I am happy to say it is working, and we are enjoying it."" And Gareth? He says, ""I am going to be the main clown in a circus one day, maybe Bippo's circus."""

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people. Our members are aged 8 to 18 years old. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.
We have three centers in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more centers soon. Since we started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined us. Sophie is one of them. She says: ""I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age didn’t matter; they trusted us to do the stories on our own. I went to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19, and now I work on a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""
**Get Involved at Every Level**
When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and take part in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to help each other. 'Peer trainers' are members who are 12 years old and older. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. Some members even present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, like in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff.
Eight-eighteen News has training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is good for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,B1,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**
Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.
During the short summer in Antarctica, we take tourists on a big passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. The flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, you can change your date if needed.
**Questions**
Here are answers to common questions about our flights.
**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours long. After about four hours, we will see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will talk about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.
**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will move to the seat on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and a seat at the end of the row for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage everyone to get up and move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot flies in big 'figure 8s' so everyone can see the sights from both sides of the plane.
**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain checks the weather and chooses the best direction for clear views.
**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives far below the plane, so we cannot see them well. We do not land in Antarctica because of environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you need to join a boat tour.
**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,B1,"**Little Chefs**
A group of children aged ten to fifteen spend their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make good food.
Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.""
Flora is twelve years old. She has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. At first, I was happy at home and didn't want to come. But now, I am really glad I decided to join.""
Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen is not always clean when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, they will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,B1,"**Winter Driving**
Winter can be dangerous for driving. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly when you go over a hill. Ice can be under the melting snow, making the road slippery. A car coming towards you might slide on the road.
**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. If you move the car too quickly, it can be hard to control. When you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you do not spill it.
**Rule Number Two** is to pay attention to what might happen. If there is a lot of ice, look further down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. You might be driving faster than you think. 
In general, when the road is wet, allow double the normal distance to stop. On snow, allow three times this distance, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,B1,"**Craigie Aitchison**
Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he decided to go to art school instead. In art school, he found the drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, and this can be seen in some of his paintings. 
Aitchison loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colors very thinly, one on top of another, from light to dark. He said, ""It's a secret - because I don't know what will happen."" He does not start with a color like yellow and plan what to do next.
Aitchison makes painting sound easy. He said, ""Anyone can buy the colors. I just notice what colors look good together."" Unlike some artists, he does not make drawings before he starts painting. He thinks that if he draws first, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. 
He likes to paint people who do not want to see their pictures while he is painting. He said, ""If they are worried and want to look, I can't paint."" Since he moved to London, he has not felt part of the Scottish art scene. He does not want to follow any tradition; he just paints in his own way. Still, his work inspires young British painters."
PET_38,B1,"**Rock Band**
Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we did not want to buy it because of the noise. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""
That was just the start. Drums are hard to move, so Ben's friends began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. 
At least Ben's hobby is good for our health. When the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music sounds a bit strange, they are a nice and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good musicians, but they play regularly in local clubs for young people.
Our main worry is that they will not spend enough time on their school work because of music. So far, this has not happened. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is sure: Ben was right. Playing music has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,B1,"**Atlantic College**
Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private school in Wales. This college helps young people learn about life outside the classroom and also study for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from many different countries. 
In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities, like helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution. 
One good thing about Atlantic College is that students come from many different backgrounds. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants available to help them. About 25% of the students are British, and many of them can only go to the college because they get help from the government.
Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for helping young people understand each other. You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don’t like them. During the summer, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""
In short, Atlantic College gives its students a great education with methods that really work."
PET_47,B1,"**Being an Older Student**
I am 32 years old, and I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes regularly, and I have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. 
Before, I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored because my job was easy and did not make me think. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university who looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be like them.
Now that I am a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. 
But I am happy to have this chance to study. I know that I need a good qualification to get a good job, and that is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer to spend my weekends studying instead of going to parties. 
I also enjoy the benefits of being a student, like long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema. Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school at this age is a good choice."
PET_48,B1,"**Henry Ford**
Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong and light steel to make cars that were cheap for regular people to buy. 
In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant people had fewer choices. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""
