**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away sounds good for the environment and makes sense for money. But it might not be that simple. In many developed countries, people have regular rubbish collection. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a dump. This service is usually free. Families pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. 

However, collecting rubbish is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed. This costs local governments money. If rubbish disposal is free, people might throw away too much rubbish. A solution is to make families pay for the rubbish they throw away. This could encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, if local governments help with recycling.

Two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, studied this idea in some American towns. They looked at a town called Charlottesville, Virginia, where families had to pay 80 cents for each bag of rubbish. At first, it seemed like a good idea. The number of bags thrown away went down by 37%. But people found ways to fit more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more tags. 

The total weight of rubbish collected only went down by 14%. In other towns without this fee, the rubbish also went down a little. Some people even dumped their rubbish illegally instead of paying. This illegal dumping might be a big part of the reason for less rubbish collected. 

On a positive note, more people started recycling their rubbish, which is free. But many were already recycling before the fee was introduced. In another study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. A small increase in fees only cuts rubbish by a tiny amount. 

People would need to buy less of everything to really reduce their rubbish. A small fee on rubbish is not likely to change much. Other things, like how much money people have and their education, also matter. In richer towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 

So, is charging families for rubbish a bad idea? Not really. Free disposal is too cheap. But simple ideas can have complicated results. We need to study these ideas carefully to understand them better."
CPE_19,"**Work and Life by Theodore Zeldin**

Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life can change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success is not enough anymore. Many people feel their work is not valued. Even famous people can feel unhappy. 

Loving your job used to be enough, but now you should think about how your job affects you. Does it help you grow as a person? If your job makes you boring or too busy to think or be creative, then money and status will not make you happy. 

Zeldin wants to find ways for work to be more fulfilling. Work should not just be about making money. It should help us live better lives and meet new people. But changing work will not end unemployment. Many educated people want jobs that are interesting and helpful.

Even jobs that used to be good, like doctors and architects, can be stressful. Many workers feel unhappy and disconnected from their jobs. In Britain, only 8 out of 100 workers feel their values match their company’s values.

Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He wants to find better ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on making companies richer, but we also need to think about ourselves as people. 

How many of us feel truly alive at work? Many workers feel trapped in their jobs, even if they can leave. For example, hotel workers often work long hours for low pay. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be places where people from different cultures meet and connect.

Hotel staff often have little chance to use their skills. If hotels listened to their workers' dreams, they could offer more services. But accountants often limit what hotels can do to make money.

Zeldin believes work is about relationships. Many people want to work in a way that gives them freedom. They should be able to choose their jobs and coworkers. Good communication is important, but it is not the same as real conversation. 

Real conversation helps us understand each other better. It creates respect and can change how we see the world. Every good conversation makes the world a little better."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: How Technology Changed Communication**

The word 'broadcasting' comes from farming. It means to spread seeds widely. This idea is about growing things in a big way and getting a good harvest. Broadcasting needs a central place to send out information, like a bucket of seeds.

We need to think about why a new technology that sends words and pictures was set up like this. Television is connected to other ways of talking, like the telegraph and telephone. But from the start, it was made to send information to many people at once. This fit well with how society was changing.

In the 1930s, some people tried to make two-way television, like a phone. They wanted to send and receive pictures. Many people in Britain were excited about this and wrote about it in magazines. But big companies took over and made rules that pushed these small inventors out. This was a missed chance for a different kind of television that could have been more equal and open.

In the early 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places, not at home. In Britain and Germany, many people saw TV together in groups. The idea of small, two-way television was not successful. Instead, companies wanted to sell TVs to homes. As people had more money in the 1920s, they wanted TVs for entertainment at home. This is happening all over the world now.

There is a strong link between how society changes and how broadcasting works. As society modernized, power and money became more concentrated. People moved around more, which made them feel more alone compared to earlier times. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with everyone and created a sense of community in the nation.

Broadcasting became the main way to share information through radio and television. However, broadcasting can also help democracy by giving everyone equal access to information. After the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way for people to participate in society.

Television is changing now, and the word 'broadcasting' might not fit anymore. It may only refer to a specific way of sharing information during a certain time in history."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you still do not feel safe. It is normal to want a home that is good for you. But sometimes, we want too many things. Advertisements make us feel like we need more. They tell us that if we do not have certain things, we are not good enough. 

Next time you walk down the street, try not to look at any ads. They are everywhere: on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. They all tell us to buy more things.

**Caves**

Many scientists study caves. They want to know where caves come from, how water moves in them, and what lives in them. Caves are small but interesting parts of nature. They make us curious and want to learn more. 

People have studied caves for a long time, especially in places where caves affect our lives. However, visiting caves can be hard, so many people who study caves are not just scientists. Many are also people who visit caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

A long time ago, many people watched the weather without any tools. This helped start the study of weather, called meteorology. Since the 17th century, it has become a very technical science. Now, we have satellites and machines that give us weather information quickly. 

Meteorology uses many difficult words that can be hard to understand. But human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. What people see and feel can help scientists understand the weather better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

I used to think that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think it is more about music. I worked at a national opera house and learned that music is the most important part. I come from the world of theatre, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, the audience and the actors usually understand each other well.

At music performances, like concerts or operas, many people do not know much about music. Some feel embarrassed about this. Most people admire the skill of the musicians. Even a good musician has worked very hard to be good. Watching great musicians is like watching athletes. We know running for a bus is similar, but athletes are much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They do not always understand how hard acting is. They may not be impressed when an actor says a long speech. People often ask actors, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences. Many people enjoy both.

I think music can learn from theatre. I have seen how a different approach can make concerts better. Live music is very emotional and can connect with the audience. However, music performances often have strict rules, like dress codes, which can make the audience feel less important.

Sometimes, music audiences clap between songs, which can break the mood of the performance. But many people are working to make concerts more welcoming. They want to show that ""serious"" music is for everyone. I remember a special event called ""In Search of Angels."" It took place in a cathedral and outside in the town. It was a great experience for the audience, who could also take part.

I wish music could be more exciting and different, like the best theatre. Sometimes, using unusual places for performances can surprise both the performers and the audience. It might not be comfortable, but theatre audiences are brave and follow artists anywhere.

I know that many plays are done in a normal way, like concerts. But I believe we can change how people experience music. I love theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them too."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
I think sand is not very nice. It can be useful for making things like glass and concrete, but I don’t like it at the beach. Sand gets in my face and my food. It can also take my things, like car keys and coins. When I am wet, sand sticks to me and is hard to get off. But when I step on a towel or walk on a clean floor, the sand falls off easily. Even after that, I find sand in my shoes and socks for days. I don’t want sand around me.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. They want to keep out bad people. A long time ago, they used ropes to lock doors. Now, we have electronic locks that use cards. But many people still like to use a real key. They feel safer with a key. One company made a new electronic lock, but they also added a real metal key to it.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the Tate Modern gallery because I don’t understand modern art. I like some of it, like furry things and bright lights. I wish I knew more about it. The idea is to feel the art, not just to understand it. This gallery helps visitors learn about the art. They have good labels that explain what the art means. Now, I can understand the art better instead of just looking at it."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Making a movie from a book often means cutting parts of the story. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. When I worked on a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This does not mean that the original words were not important. It is just different how people pay attention to stories in books and movies.

In a book, we often repeat things to help readers remember characters and their traits. We might say ""he said"" or ""she said"" to make it clear who is talking. In movies, we can see the characters and understand who is speaking without these tags. 

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives for a while. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, we are back in the real world. Some people think movies are just for fun and not real art. Many older people, like our parents and teachers, did not see movies as important. They liked to be entertained, but they did not think of movies as art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were no clear signs. There were three main entrances, but they all looked the same. It was confusing for new people, but most workers knew how to get around. Because of their hard work, people could enjoy stories of romance and adventure in movies.

**Film-Makers**

Many people want to make movies. There are many books and classes about how to write scripts and make films. Some competitions even give away cameras to help new filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez made a famous movie called El Mariachi for only $7,000. He became a well-known director quickly. 

In the past, filmmakers had to work for a long time before making their first movie. They learned by working as editors or writers. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film. But now, many new filmmakers have to do everything on their own without help from big studios."
CPE_3,"In the past, there were many council houses on the west side of the city. These houses were small and not very nice. In summer, there was a bad smell from a factory nearby. In the mornings, a paperboy often looked unhappy as he walked to deliver papers. I don’t remember much from my early life, but I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses far away. 

I also remember my mother. She was small and often angry. I didn’t understand why she was angry, so I couldn’t make her feel better. Even as a child, I noticed that she was very lonely. She felt alone even when she was with other people. My mother had strict rules about how to behave. She would clean the house a lot and tell me to ""behave proper."" I didn’t really understand these rules. They meant not going into other people’s gardens and sitting quietly at the dinner table. 

My mother had some friends, but they were not very cheerful. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn’t say much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They often talked about their problems, and I felt like I was part of their complaints. It felt heavy, like a big weight on my shoulders, and I wanted to be free from it.

Growing up in West Earlham was very routine. Until I was five, I stayed at home. I remember playing on the floor while my mother sat in a chair. After I turned five, I went to school half a mile away. Some kids had mothers who rode bikes, but my mother let me go with other children. 

I remember summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories, and once I went to a charity event where a kind woman gave out lemonade. My mother didn’t like the charity and thought people only wanted money. She often talked about how bad politicians were. 

My mother was not very kind, but she did care about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on the bus. We looked at paintings together. My mother even made a joke once about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying she wouldn’t want to meet him at night. This was a rare moment of fun with her."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd side of the street. It was getting dark, and the air was wet and cool. I knew this street well. I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store. I also remembered the Krings and the Pottses, where my first friends, all girls, lived. 

The houses on this street were special to me. I remembered the little places in the sidewalk where rainwater flowed from the roofs. I used to ride my roller skates and scooter there. As the street went down, the houses changed. The porches were lower, and the yards were smaller. 

Over the years, things changed. Some wooden parts of the houses were replaced with iron. In Shillington, some homes became stores, and some stores became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these places with the smells of the old shops.

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. His flat has big doors and brick walls. He did not want his flat to be empty. He wanted to separate his living space from his work space. He used a big piece of plastic to create a hallway and hide his office. He wanted his kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 

To make his flat feel warm, he used light wood for the floors and added some old furniture from his parents. 

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. He wrote a famous book called *In Patagonia* in 1977. This book changed travel writing. It was exciting and full of imagination. 

Chatwin sometimes changed facts in his stories to make them better. He believed that traveling could help people discover new histories and adventures.

**Swimming**

One summer day, it rained heavily. I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. I swam back and forth, watching the raindrops splash in the water. The best part was when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds disappeared. 

During this rainy summer in 1996, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea. I felt tired of swimming in the same place, like a tiger in a cage. 

Many places today have signs and labels. This makes the world feel less real. Walking, cycling, and swimming help us feel free and discover the wild parts of our world. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious places that still exist."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose. But now, scientists think differently. They say crying is important for social connections, especially between mothers and their children. Many people believe that children cry because they feel helpless.

It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel close.

People cry for different reasons. We might cry when we feel sad for someone who is treated unfairly. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to when we hear beautiful music or see a touching speech. We may also cry when we watch a sad movie, and this happens more when we are with other people than when we are alone.

Crying is important for social reasons, and scientists are still studying it."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming. It means the Earth is getting warmer. But how much warmer will it get? And how will it change our lives? Many people have some idea about global warming, but they are not sure what will happen because of it.

A warmer Earth will change the weather everywhere. This will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and live. If these resources change, it is a serious problem.

In the last 100 years, human actions have made the air warmer by adding gases. These gases are connected to the temperature of the Earth. Scientists think that the Earth has warmed by about 6 degrees Celsius in the last century. They believe this is mostly because of pollution from humans.

Scientists use computers to predict what will happen with the climate. These computers use science to look at temperature, pressure, and other factors. But these predictions are not always perfect. They can be slow and expensive to use. 

Most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. Predictions say that by the year 2100, the average temperature of the Earth will rise by 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius. The sea level will also rise by 15 to 95 centimeters. This means we will see more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts.

These changes will affect where plants and animals live. They will also change how we get food and water. Some areas may have big problems, but some changes might be good. For example, in Australia, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures.

However, many changes will not be good. Even small changes in climate can make water harder to find. This is a big problem in dry areas. In places like the Mediterranean, there has been less rain in recent years.

Another problem is that glaciers are melting. This will change the ice in the Arctic and affect animals and people living there. The most visible effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds more water to the oceans. 

Many people live near the coast, so rising sea levels can cause flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could be affected. Many people could lose their homes. Small island countries could disappear completely, which would be very bad for their people and cultures."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars

Wanted: a married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. The couple must be healthy and strong. This will be the first astronauts to go to Mars if Dennis Tito's plan works. He wants to send a spacecraft on 5 January 2018. The spacecraft will go to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. Saving fuel is very important. The next time Mars and Earth are in the right place is in 2031. 

There is a lot of work to do to make new technology for this mission. If the technology is ready, the spacecraft might go. Even if it does not go, the work will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Art is important, but it can be hard to understand. Many people think of art as just a building, a book, a painting, or a statue. But art is more than these things. It is about how we feel and experience them.

Sometimes, famous art is seen as perfect. This can make it hard for people to see new ideas about it. When art becomes very famous, it can feel separate from our everyday lives. This makes it hard to understand its true meaning.

To understand art better, we need to connect it to our daily experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our lives. People who study art should help us see this connection.

To really understand art, we might need to forget about it for a moment. We should look at the simple things in life that make us happy. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about them. But if we want to understand how they grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.

Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When art is only in museums, people look for joy in other places. Some people still think of art as separate from everyday life, even if they don’t like that idea.

When art is connected to our daily lives, we can enjoy it more. The best appreciation of art happens when it is part of our usual experiences."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

Lions are big cats that live in groups. They hunt together to catch food. When the sun sets, they move quietly to find their prey. They work as a team to get their next meal. 

Researchers studied lions for many years. They wanted to know why lions hunt together, take care of their young, and scare away other animals with their loud roars. They thought that working together would help lions have more babies. But sometimes, if one lion helps too much, it can lose out. 

Lions are very good at resting and doing nothing. This made it hard for researchers to learn about them. Lions can live for up to 18 years, so it took a long time to find answers.

**Pop Music Review**

Bedrock is a band that made a new album called ""New Life."" This album changed rock music in a big way. It was different from older music that was serious and loud. Instead, it had happy sounds and funny lyrics. 

The band wrote songs about everyday things like relaxing in the sun. Some songs were sad but beautiful. The album had 16 great songs with no bad ones, which is very impressive.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

When I was a child, I loved stories about wise women called 'The Sibyl.' One story was about an old woman who tried to sell books to a king. She burned some books when he refused to buy them. In the end, he bought the last three books for a lot of money. This story taught me a lesson about life.

I was often alone as a child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they did not want to play with me. My mother told me to do something fun so they would want to join me. It worked, and I learned a good lesson.

When I had to write a travel book, I looked for places that interested me. I don’t like to travel much. I prefer to think about old places and history.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you send your book to a publisher, it goes into a big pile of other books. Some young people or part-time workers look at these books. They want to find something special. If they like your book, they will show it to a more important editor.

The editor will decide if your book is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about how popular you might be as an author. Publishers like to meet authors before they decide to publish a book."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

In the early 1990s, working in advertising was very hard. Many businesses were struggling because of a bad economy. In Britain, in 1991, many people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken away by banks. All businesses were affected, and some lost a lot of money.

People who worked in advertising felt a lot of pressure. They had to help their companies make money, but they had less money to spend on advertising. They were told to do more with less money. At the same time, companies started to understand that they needed to make products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make.

Because of this, advertising became more important. Many companies began to pay more attention to marketing. They learned more about it, and some brands started to market themselves better. This made advertising people more respected, but it also made their jobs harder.

In the 1980s, advertising was doing very well. But in the early 1990s, it was very difficult. Many companies looked closely at how much they were spending on advertising. They wanted to know if it was worth the money. They needed proof that advertising helped them make money.

Companies wanted better advertising strategies and better ideas. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work for them. They wanted these people to work very hard to create great ads.

Even though advertising is a tough job, many advertising workers still face the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less money. There are other challenges too. The economy is still bad, and there are new rules about advertising. Also, people’s needs and wants are changing.

Now, it is very important for advertising to work well. Companies want to know which ads are successful. However, help for making better ads is not easy to find. Many companies are too busy to talk about their problems. Those that are doing well often keep their success a secret.

This means that while there are some events to learn about advertising, many books do not help much. They often make it seem like all advertising is great, which is not true. This does not help the people in companies who need to make good advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Kitchen**

When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice. Most of my friends wanted different jobs. Being a chef is hard work. Chefs work long hours, and the job can be stressful and not well paid. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life was not fun. Being a chef seemed like a good change for me. It felt serious and real, unlike my life at school.

My wish to cook was not just because I was a student. I also loved food. I first felt this love when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I remember my first dish very well. After that meal, I wanted to learn how to cook. I changed my life to prepare for being a chef. My history degree did not matter to me anymore. I learned to cook by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.

**Diving Lessons**

The swimming teacher was a strong man with tattoos. When I asked him to teach me to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this until my lesson was over. The next time, he made me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict. Every time I came up from the water, he told me what to do: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight!"" ""Point your toes!""

The next week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I was scared. I stood there, trying to be brave. I waved my arms like he taught me, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly. The teacher looked at me with disappointment. But I was still happy. I felt free, like a bird.

**Travelers**

Some people love to travel. They do things that seem strange to us. They climb high mountains, sail alone on the ocean, and eat bugs if they have to. They can live for a long time in unknown places. Some people think these travelers are odd. They are different from us, and we can ignore them. We are happy in our comfortable lives with warm beds and kitchens.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time on it. He is not the best sailor, but he knows how to sail. He likes to write about his sailing adventures. His small boat has a device that tells him where he is on the ocean. He likes this device, but he also thinks it takes away from the real experience of sailing. He believes that sailors should look at the waves and feel the sea, not just follow a compass. He thinks the ocean used to be full of life, but now it is just a place to sail. Because of this, he has time to watch the waves carefully."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can see our own lives in the stories of others. In books, we find our thoughts and feelings. Authors use words to describe things we feel but cannot say. They help us understand ourselves better. 

When we read or travel, we see things differently. At first, in a new place, we notice everything. Reading a good book also opens our eyes to things we did not see before. We start to notice the colors in the sky, the changes in a friend’s face, or feelings we did not know we had.

**Author's Note**

These thoughts about travel were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made some small changes to fit the articles, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but I did not change the main ideas. 

Traveling by plane has changed how we see the world. Many people can now visit places without needing special skills, just the price of a ticket. I believe that my fellow travelers are not blind to the world around them. Even a simple postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism words that are used too much, ""ecotourism"" would win. This word started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour companies realized that many travelers wanted to travel without hurting the places they visited. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes to a short boat trip in Australia. 

Many tours that include nature, wildlife, or adventure are called ecotourism. The original idea was good, but now there are no clear rules. This makes it hard for travelers to know what ecotourism really means.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again a few years ago, and it helped me remember that time. In Transylvania, I had a better time than I expected. I stayed in friendly homes for weeks. 

When I stopped for a long time, I did not write in my journal. I thought there was nothing to write about. When I moved on, I was slow to start writing again. I worried that some details were out of order, but I decided it did not matter much. I let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought to be new and only from the 1800s and 1900s. But many people say that fashion has a long history. They think it started in the 1500s and 1600s when trade began to grow. As societies grew and more clothes were made, the meaning of clothing also changed. Now, it is hard to know what a piece of clothing really means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.

**Writer**

Many stories in the news make it seem like all writers are very successful. But for many writers, life is different. Some writers have other jobs and write in the evenings. Others, like me, do many small jobs. I teach, do workshops, and write articles. I heard about a job writing for a chocolate factory, but I never got that chance. Still, I manage to write my book by working part-time and getting help from friends.

**Sudden Fame**

We started to perform in small places, and soon they were full of fans. We had to use secret doors to avoid being crowded by people. On our days off, it was hard to go outside without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched us, and our managers took care of us. Even though I was shy, I felt a strange confidence. I was not used to this new life."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future Ahead**

Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, it became easier to listen to music. We have radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and many new ways to enjoy music. But, fewer people are playing live music, and there are fewer jobs for musicians.

More people can access music now, and this will likely continue. Music is important for many reasons. In our country, no big event is without music. For people, music gives chances for many activities, both formal and informal. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.

I believe people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can help children learn better. Research in the USA shows that making music can help with thinking skills. In Europe, group music lessons can help children make friends and focus better in school.

Playing an instrument can also help with other skills. For example, practicing can help with good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach people to be on time and organized. Because of this, there will still be a need for music lessons in the near future.

What about the future? Will music change? I think two things will happen. First, people will listen to many different kinds of music. New styles will mix together. Second, technology will be used more to create and play music. This will make it easier for more people to make music, but it may mean fewer live performances.

More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities. If this happens, music teachers will need to change how they teach. They will need to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means music lessons will need to change to be relevant for more people.

Teachers will need to inspire and teach students of all ages. They will also need skills to work with different groups and communicate well. This is a big change from how things are done now. It is a chance for music education to show how good it can be.

Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is very important, but sometimes we forget this. Everyone in the music world needs to work together to make sure people remember how special music is."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes, people do not like actors. This can happen when actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of explaining their art, they often use boring phrases or talk about gossip. 

Paul Scofield, an actor, wrote to a friend that acting is best when it is done, not when it is talked about. He said that every time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn new things. After a play, the actor feels empty until the next performance. This emptiness shows when people talk about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet, a young man who is becoming an adult. His performance is simple but very good. He shows a mix of anger and humor, making his character both strong and lovable. You can see how he uses his body to show his character's feelings.

**What is Acting?**

Acting is about showing feelings and actions. It raises questions about what makes a character come alive on stage.

**One Director's Rehearsal Method**

This director has a special way to help actors prepare. First, the stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly. When it is their turn, they think about the words and what they mean. They take a breath and let their thoughts come to them before they speak. 

For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they might remember a time they waited in line. They should not plan too much but trust their feelings.

**The Perfect Theatre**

A good theatre makes you feel important. When you go to see a show, it should feel special. The people working there should care about the performance. The audience should feel close to the actors and be able to see and hear everything well.

The size of the theatre matters too. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong. Many theatres built a long time ago are good because they make you feel connected to the stage.

When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising and new. If it is not special, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll music in the 1950s was very popular with young people. It was important because it changed the lives of many adults too. This music helped new rock stars to grow. They listened to it and knew it would be a big part of their lives. 

For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting music was from a radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, hosted by Alan Freed. Many young musicians listened to this show. 

Like John Lennon, who lived far away in Liverpool, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He was excited to go from just listening to music to making his own music.

**Snow**

I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was very strong and pushed me over. I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole that was about four feet deep. The snow had covered a space between two rocks. 

I climbed out of the hole, feeling scared. I wondered what would happen if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think. In one hour, I had walked about half a mile. I realized I had to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that help researchers learn about qualitative research. These books talk a lot about how to collect data, but they do not explain much about how to analyze the data. 

To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to share their experiences. We wanted to understand how they analyze their data. This is not easy, but we want to make the process clearer. 

We let our contributors share their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he did not remember much.

Many people like to use the internet and computers for learning. But is learning from a screen good? One writer tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something.

Research shows that learning is better when children talk with teachers or parents. It is important to have conversations. Using new technology to teach children is good, but traditional education is still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most movies in the world were made in Hollywood. People who lived there did not like this change. They thought Hollywood was becoming a bad place. But in the end, people accepted it because Hollywood was successful. Success means making a lot of money from movies.

Hollywood has changed a lot. A long time ago, it was a small village with orange trees. Now, it is as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. But it still feels like a small town. People in Hollywood mostly talk about movies: how much money they make, who is dating who, and what projects they are working on. Many successful people want to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. It is the place where many people in show business want to be.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to make a lasting record of what they saw. With new tools, they could take pictures that looked real and detailed. This made other artists worried. They thought photography could not be art because it used machines.

But photographers believed they had found a new way to express themselves. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils. They wanted to show the world and nature in their own way.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, every children's book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older children. There were many children's books, but most were made with a small budget. This meant some books were not very good, but the best artists always did their best work.

The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place to look for interesting art. Some of these treasures will be shown to the public again, either through new books or exhibitions. There are signs that people are starting to pay more attention to these illustrations again. Soon, a publisher will likely create new editions of classic children's book illustrations."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. When you say, ""I am here,"" you are also showing your location to many people, not all of whom you may want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have problems.

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can get lost in this sharing. It can feel sad, but we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet before us.

In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the web. At that time, the internet was mostly for students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his experiences. He created a blog where he wrote about everything in his life. Many people liked to read it.

One day, Hall had to take down his blog because he fell in love. His partner told him to choose between the blog and their relationship. Hall chose love, but he felt sad because sharing his life online made it hard for people to trust him.

In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job. One day, someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 

Armstrong was upset but later got married and started her blog again, focusing on her family. Now, she is very popular as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps her family.

The lesson is clear: the internet lets us say many things, but we should think carefully before we share."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired. In rich and busy countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious is common. In the USA, 40 million people have trouble sleeping. Some books in Britain talk about people who cannot sleep or places that study sleep.

A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. One researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about 8 hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.

In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors and how noise at airports disturbs sleep. They ask students to help with their research. Students get paid £5 an hour and change their sleep patterns.

Dr. Louise Reyner helps the students feel better. Some are scared because they wear special equipment on their heads. But the researchers want to learn about sleep, not dreams. In a dark room, they have a driving simulator. The students come in the afternoon when they are usually sleepy. They drive while answering questions. 

One student tries hard not to fall asleep. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink and nod off. He wakes up suddenly, but the car goes off the road. Dr. Reyner says that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safe driver for a while. She suggests energy drinks and gum for people who work at night.

Scientists know some things about sleep. People sleep in cycles. They go through four stages of sleep, from light to deep. When we dream, our body is still, so we do not hurt ourselves. Sleep may help our bodies heal, but scientists are not sure how.

Women usually sleep about half an hour longer than men. Older people need less sleep, but no one knows why. Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely.

In the past, people slept differently. A history professor found that from 1500 to 1850, people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, and then went back to sleep. This time was for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. Poor people enjoyed this quiet time.

By the 17th century, rich people started to sleep less as they used more light. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours. In some places, people still do not have set bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribes, noise and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep all night. 

It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wore a cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the mountains and felt out of place. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but then I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He looked very different from me. 

I used to be a racing driver. I loved it and it was all I knew. But now I do not race anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when they stop racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they did not work out. 

I thought about being a commentator for races, but many people wanted that job. I also thought about selling classic cars, but that did not work either. It was a bad time to sell cars. 

Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. People do not want to hear about my past. They do not want to hear about how I almost became a champion. Even if I was a champion, people would not want to listen for long. 

I had a good life as a driver. I made money and had fun. But I miss driving fast cars. I miss the excitement and the people who cared about what I said. Now, I have a lot of free time. 

I looked at the blue sky. There were no big birds flying above me. I saw some small brown birds in a cactus. They seemed to want me to leave. I realized that I had a lot to learn about being in the desert."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people walk in the city streets. If you walk with them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe place to live, and good schools and jobs. Some people do not like how fast new buildings are being built, but many agree that new people and tourists have made the city better. 

A long time ago, people called Vancouver ""Terminal City"" because it was a place where many journeys started. Now, Vancouver is still a place where many people come and go.

**Writing Letters**

Journalists, like me, are not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not want to write for free. But I think it is because we want our writing to be perfect. A real artist can write without thinking too much about it. They may change their words many times, but they know how to make their writing special. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about how to make them great. He just wrote.

**New Supermarket Opening**

Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A famous person would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day, and famous people are not needed. Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy did not care who opened it. They just wanted to be first. 

Someone said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news made the people at the front feel happy, while those who came later felt jealous."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**  
The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. Many people talked about it, but it did not make a lot of money. Later, it became popular again on television. This film inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that he did not know what he could or could not do, so he just made the film his way. He had a great team with him, including cameraman Gregg Toland and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a story about a newspaper owner who was like Hearst, Welles knew it was a good idea for him as a director and actor. He worked very hard on it.

**Dermot and Carmel**  
Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He said twice that he might be late and might stop at the golf club. He wanted to talk to someone there. Carmel nodded but seemed to not really hear him. He asked her, ""Will you be okay? What will you do today?"" She smiled and said, ""Funny you ask. I have nothing to do, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is a waste of time to do nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You should enjoy your day. If I am late, I won’t need food, so don’t worry."" She replied, ""That’s fine.""

**Job Titles**  
A recent study showed that job titles can make people unhappy at work. A survey found that 90% of bosses and 70% of workers think titles create problems between coworkers. Most surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a better job title. This shows that people want to feel important. In the early 21st century, no one wants to be called ""less important."" The new job titles sound nice, but they often mean the same thing as before."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. I loved taking pictures. It was my job and my passion. I liked how light looked on different things. A single photo could show a moment in time, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture. I had my camera ready and kept looking for good shots.

Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. It became very popular, and many magazines wanted it. I felt lucky. After that, I worked for myself, but things did not go as well as I hoped. That is why I was in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photos, and I was getting paid. That was good for me.

I got this job by chance. I had taken photos in London for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons."" The book had pictures of London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I took nice photos in London during all the seasons. After I finished, I learned that the photographer in Vienna had left the job. They asked me to take his place because they liked my work. I was happy to go because things were not good at home.

I stayed at a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy trip, and I did not take many photos. This time, I was alone, and I felt it would be different. When I arrived, I saw the beautiful city covered in snow. I was excited to take great pictures.

On my first day, I did not take any photos. I rode the trams around the city, enjoying the sights. The weather was cold, but it was beautiful. I wanted to take my own pictures of Vienna, not copy what the other photographer had done.

A photograph is a moment in time. You have to wait for the right moment. So, I looked around and waited. The next morning, I woke up early. It had snowed, and the main square was white and quiet. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one shot. It was very tall and wide. I knew I would have to find a different way to capture it.

Photography has always felt magical to me. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photo in a dark room. Even when you understand how it works, it still feels mysterious. That morning at the square, something surprising happened, but I was ready for it."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art**

Good news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed. It is now a place full of amazing things. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art from the last 60 years. It shows that many artists have made moving art, even if people did not notice it before.

The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied this art for a long time. There are not many words to explain the art, so visitors can enjoy and discover things on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney is a popular artist. Many people like his work, even if they do not usually like art. People may like his art because it shows real things and is easy to understand. His art often shows fun and relaxing moments, which helps people escape from daily life. Some people like Hockney not just for his art, but also for his fun personality and clever words in interviews.

Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. They say he is too popular. But others believe that being popular does not mean his art is not good. Hockney knows his art has limits, and he does not think it is important to be called a great artist. He believes that only time will tell how good his art really is.

**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have seen many art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not so good. I often feel frustrated when exhibitions seem to push a certain idea or message. Sometimes this works, and we see new trends in art. But often, it feels forced or not real.

To change this, I worked with seven artists to create a show called ""Window-shopping."" We used an empty warehouse to show our art. Each artwork was different, but they all showed that they are art. For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley made a video of him breaking a camera. These artworks do not fit into a specific theme, but they can still be together in one show.

**Art History**

Some people love paintings but are afraid to think too much about them. They worry that thinking will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus on theory and forget the joy of looking at art. This is like knowing how to cook a dish but not enjoying the taste.

Enjoying art is important, but knowing more about it can also make it more enjoyable. Our feelings about art are influenced by the society we live in. What we like is not just about our personal taste but also about what is valued in our culture. While it is important to feel and enjoy art, thinking about it can also be valuable."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age liked shiny things. One day, while sitting by a river, a person found a shiny yellow stone. It was not like other stones. This stone was gold. People liked gold because it was soft and easy to shape. They also found copper, which was useful for making tools. Soon, people began to work with metals to make their lives better.

**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, bumpy road to the town. The wind was very strong, and waves hit the shore. The streets were empty, and all the windows were closed. We saw the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The dark clouds made me think that coming to Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I had told my friend we would walk by the beautiful coast and enjoy warm evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived long ago are not here anymore. We cannot see what they did or how they lived. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas on people from the past. However, we can use computer modelling. This means we can create pictures of old places and make virtual people who act like real humans. We can change things, like the weather or the number of people, and see how they would react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Two scientists, Cheney and Seyfarth, studied vervet monkeys. One day, a strong male monkey saw a strange male monkey near their group. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he did, the strong male might lose his place as the leader. 

To keep the strange monkey away, the strong male made a loud alarm call. This call is used when they see a leopard. The strange monkey got scared and went back to the trees. The strong male did this every time the strange monkey came close. 

But then, the strong male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while he was walking across the ground. 

**What Cats Catch**

In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year! 

But this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in the village. The important question is: can the bird population survive? The answer is yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. So, cats are hunters, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping place and slowly walk to the water. They make sad sounds as they go. 

When they reach the water, they relax and forget their tiredness. They stay in the water for a long time, making soft sounds. Slowly, they swim away, looking tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants.

**Picasso's Painting**

Pablo Picasso painted a picture in 1940. He painted fish while he was in a fishing town. The painting shows a table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive, but the painting is hard to understand. 

Picasso used flat shapes and soft colors to make it look calm, like underwater. But there is also a feeling of danger. The fish look like they are ready to fight the crab. The painting shows both peace and a hint of violence."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Photography is a way to take pictures of life and activities. It has been around for about 150 years. With photography, we can see moments in time and different places. It shows us images from faraway places and important events in our lives.

Before photography, people made pictures a long time ago. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We do not know exactly why they made these pictures. They could have been for hunting, religion, or just to make life more colorful. Pictures have always been a part of human culture.

When photography was invented in the 1800s, it changed how we see the world. People thought photographs showed the truth. The camera works like our eyes and can capture what we see. This made photography very important in art and culture.

Some people believe that photographs are a universal language. For example, a person from a different culture can understand a picture of the sun and moon. But as the world changed, we started to wonder if everyone understands photographs the same way.

Photography can show reality very well. When someone shows a picture and says, ""This is my grandson,"" it feels very real. Since photography was invented in 1839, it has changed a lot. At first, it was just a way to keep memories. Now, photographs are also important historical documents. They tell us about the people and society that made them.

Photography is not just a way to show what happens. It can also help bring change in society. For example, during the Italian Renaissance, new ways of seeing things changed art. Today, photography helps us understand the world and see its problems."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry is fun, but it can be hard. There is no one right way to do it. If you want to write poems, you should read a lot and write a lot. Let your imagination be free. Some people need to feel safe to write poems, while others write when they are sad. Some people write at certain times, and others wait for a good idea. All ways are okay as long as you find your own style. 

**The Short Story**

In a short story, you should not have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if they help the story. A memory can help the main character and move the story forward, but it should not slow it down. Talking between characters is very important. It can show different sides of a story quickly. Too many words can make a short story boring. In a short story, every word must be important.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. When you play chess, you make moves without knowing what will happen next. You learn to see the whole game, not just one move. The more you play chess, the better you understand it. The same is true for writing screenplays. 

**Looking at Writing**

People naturally learn to speak, but writing is different. A long time ago, Charles Darwin said that speaking is a human instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons. If children do not have a language, they make one. But writing systems are rare and were created in a few places. Many children today still find it hard to read and write. Writing is something we learn, and we need to understand how it works."
CPE_8,"I have never started a book with so much worry. I call it a book, but I am not sure if it is really a novel. I do not have a big story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about his life in between our meetings. 

I could make up stories to fill in the gaps, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write what I know. To protect the people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this book names that I made up. I have also changed some details so that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When he dies, he might not leave any mark on the world, like a stone thrown into a river. If people read my book, they will read it for its own interest.

But maybe the way he lives and his special character will influence others. After he is gone, people might realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book will help those who write about my friend.

I do not say that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I did not take notes, but I remember well what was important to me. I have put these conversations in my own words, but I believe they show what was said. I said before that I have not made anything up, but I have taken the freedom that historians take. I have imagined some words for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and interesting. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to do this to make it better.

Another reason I feel worried about this book is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It is hard to really know people, and I think you can only truly know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, and the poems they read. You cannot learn these things just by hearing about them; you have to live them. 

Because you cannot know people from another country well, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen before. If I wrote about others in short stories, it was easier because you can give a quick idea and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not say that my characters see themselves the same way I see them; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Poetry recitals are events where people read poems out loud. Many people today feel confused about poetry. There are many types of poetry and different ways to write and share it. Some poets write poems to be read on paper, while others like to perform their poems for an audience.

In the last twenty years, poetry readings have become more popular. Small groups in towns hold these events in homes or community centers. Schools and colleges invite poets to read their work to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings with famous poets.

For poets who perform, reading their work in front of people is good for them. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand. However, poets who write more complex poems may not be appreciated by new audiences. These poets work hard to create deep and meaningful poetry, but people may not understand it right away.

Listening to poetry readings is not the same as reading poems on paper, but it can be fun and helpful. Hearing poets read their work can show how to emphasize certain words. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems before the reading.

One good reason for popular poetry readings is that they help people enjoy poetry. This way, more people can see poetry as something for everyone, not just a few special people."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Oral history is when historians use people's stories to learn about the past. But this can be tricky. When someone talks about their past, their story can change because of who is listening. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers things. The historian also has their own ideas about the past, which can affect the story. So, historians help create new evidence. However, the person telling the story is also not always sure about their memories. Their memories can be mixed with things they have seen or heard from other places, like TV. Sometimes, they remember the past with feelings of happiness or sadness that come from later experiences. These feelings can make their stories seem more real, but they might not be true to the time they are talking about.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main ways to study animals: the physiological way and the whole animal way. Physiologists look at how the body works, like how nerves and muscles help animals behave. The whole animal approach studies how animals act in their natural environment. There are two types of people in this approach: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs with animals like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study animals in the wild and how they behave naturally. Both types of study are important. Even if we understand how nerves work, we still need to look at how animals behave as a whole. For example, if we want to understand how a bird builds a nest, we cannot just look at its nerve cells. 

**The Social Sciences**  
When students start studying social sciences, they have to learn two things at once. They need to understand the subject and also learn how to study it. This means they must know the facts and also the methods used to find these facts. Social sciences are about people and society, but they are more than just common sense. Each social science looks at different parts of social life and uses special methods and ideas. These ideas help social scientists understand more than what we see every day.

**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He did not talk about how useful a building is, but he did explain how to make buildings for different purposes. At first, architecture was seen as an art. Before classical architecture, there were simple homes made of basic materials. These simple homes helped shape the later, more complex buildings. Even though classical temples look fancy, they are really based on simple, single-room homes."
CPE_7,"Lily and her sister Mui kept a secret from Chen. Lily was learning to drive. She drove around the gardens and the train tracks. One time, she drove over a small bridge and bumped the car. But Chen was happy when he found out. He said, ""You can drive, Lily! Good job!"" 

Mui thought it was strange that Chen was not upset. He was excited to make plans with Lily to go for a drive. They chose a Monday next month. It was a quiet day, so they would leave early and come back by noon. This way, they would not lose any customers. Lily would practice driving before that.

Mui bought a road map. She got a discount, and Chen was impressed. But Lily felt a little hurt because she thought Mui did not trust her. Soon, they were at the beach. Lily drove very well. Mui, sitting in the back, had to agree. Chen even clapped for her. 

They drove past the gasworks and the lagoon. Lily parked the car in a quiet street. She was not sure about the parking rules, so she paid to avoid problems. Lily locked the car doors carefully. Chen joked, ""No one will want that old car."" The sisters did not like this. 

Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Man Kee was small and warm. He held Chen's sleeve. Chen thought about how he wanted to raise Man Kee. He wanted him to learn about numbers and own many restaurants one day. 

Chen looked at the sea and saw a ship. He used a telescope to see it better. At first, he could not find it, but then he did. It was a small, old ship. Chen told Man Kee, ""This ship will take us home one day."" He kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily came over and put her arm around Chen. Chen wanted Man Kee to see the ship, but when he let go of the telescope, it stopped working. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily could only see seagulls flying."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars when it is clear. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched me as I pulled up the well bucket. I steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I did not think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket off the wall. I fell into the well. I hit my head. 

At first, I saw strange lights. Later, I thought about how cartoon characters see stars when they hit their heads. I felt confused, scared, and then angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I wanted to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice. I lay still and watched you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help.

I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself out of the well. I landed on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows. My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming. My father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling excited. 

Then I saw drops of water on the ground from my wet clothes. I looked back at my father shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I could not believe no one saw them. My mother was screaming loudly. I felt scared. I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. I felt bad for not thinking about this before. 

I thought of a plan. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding. I cried out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I fell down on the stones. I sat up, feeling comforted in my mother’s arms. I said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it to get out. I thought I was almost safe until my father came to me. He wanted me to tell my story again. I hesitated. 

He looked at me closely. I said the secret tunnel fell in after me and that the well was dangerous. I looked into my father's eyes and felt scared. He said, ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" and walked away. Arthur looked at me with pity. He knew I was lying. I felt sad and ashamed. I realized my father and Arthur saw my actions clearly, and it made me feel even worse."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan is a widow. Her children are now grown up. She is leaving her family home. A big van is outside. It says, ""Removers of Distinction."" The workers are taking everything from the house. They are wrapping things in newspaper and putting them in boxes. Fred, the removal man, is very careful with the breakable items. 

Susan is leaving a beautiful house. It has four floors and looks over a small harbour. She remembers the years she spent there with her children. When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move. He is making sure she does not forget about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very bossy and wants to take care of the piano.

Fred, the removal man, says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replies, ""Yes, they do. They help us until everything is in the van, and then they cry in an empty room."" Susan understands why.

Susan thinks about the piano. She wanted to tell the movers about it, but Robert said it was their job to see it. The piano is in the best room of the house. They will take it last. 

Susan sits on the bottom stair. She remembers the day they moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers worked hard for two hours to get it in. Robert watched, and Francesca cried, ""We can't live without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside. Her husband, Peter, helped solve the problem. They took out a window and used a crane to lift the piano inside. The children were very happy.

Now, Susan thinks about how her children are busy and do not come home much. She is also having trouble going up the stairs. She worries about the piano again. Fred asks her if she is okay. She feels nervous. 

Robert and Francesca come to watch. Fred says, ""No tears then?"" Susan feels like crying. Moving things makes her feel sad. 

Then, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is careful with it. They take it outside and put it behind the van. Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together. They are happy it is over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan only sheds tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**

Anyone can write book reviews online. This idea started when the Internet became popular. At first, it was hard for many people to publish their thoughts because they needed some technical skills. But then, Amazon.com, a big online bookstore, made it easy for everyone to write reviews about books.

On Amazon, anyone can write what they think about a book and give it up to five stars. Each book has its own page, and when someone writes a review, it shows up right away. This helps other readers see what people think about the book, not just what the publisher says.

Amazon is very popular, and many people write reviews every day. Because there are so many reviews, Amazon cannot check all of them. They have a team that looks for bad reviews, like those with bad words or personal attacks on the author. But many reviews are still anonymous, so people can write whatever they want.

Some authors write good reviews for their own books. For example, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset about bad reviews for his book. He wrote some good reviews under a fake name to make his book look better. But later, he told everyone what he did, and Amazon removed his fake reviews.

Authors can also write comments about their books on Amazon. They can say nice things and even give their email addresses for readers to contact them. However, Amazon does not always check if the comments are really from the authors.

Sometimes, readers get very angry about a book. For example, when a book called ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, some people who were mentioned in it wrote bad reviews. Many of these reviews disappeared after a few days. But Amazon liked that so many people were writing and reading reviews because it was good for business.

Most reviews on Amazon are serious. They help other readers decide if a book is good to buy. A famous writer, George Orwell, once said that writing too many reviews can be hard. But now, with everyone able to write reviews, it is a good thing for readers."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people often think that artists must be different from others. We say that art should be unique and surprising. We like to admire artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. But when we see new art today, we sometimes think it is too strange and not real art. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be new and confusing. We forget that today’s art has old ideas and methods.

In the past, people asked artists to create art for special reasons. Art was a part of everyday life. Now, artists work alone, and we can get upset if they try to connect with us.

**A Situation to Think About**

I want to share a situation and ask a question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text talks about many kinds of pictures and says there are many different types. Then, the artist asks someone to make a canvas and write the text on it in simple black letters. My question is: is this finished piece a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is a rule for painters: once you find a style that sells, you should stick to it. People expect artists to keep making the same type of art. If they try something new, people may not like it. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, can change their style and still be successful. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He is moving from still life paintings to paintings about the London Underground. He finds the underground world interesting. His new show, called Underground Encounters, has 40 paintings and drawings that show the magic of this hidden world.

**A Short Story**

I have come to this island with some books. I do not know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would come to such a lonely place. I am here to heal myself. I am alone except for an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house. I feel neither happy nor sad; I feel like I am floating in my memories.

I talked about how art can seem useless, but it also brings comfort. Art helps us see the world in a new way. Our daily lives can hide the true meaning of things. For artists, art helps us deal with our pain and find joy. It allows us to face our lives and use our imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father had just picked me and my big suitcase from my fancy girls' school. He also went to Parent's Day, where I got a prize for Latin and another prize for my exams. He talked a lot with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already knew what he was thinking. My dad usually talks a lot, but now he was quiet. ""You can't fool me. You will do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I replied. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My dad knew a lot about lawyers. 

""I just said that,"" I said. ""I didn't know what else to say!"" 

""And I heard you have the right personality. You can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like to perform,"" he said. 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV."" 

""Anyway,"" he said, ""I feel like you will not want to join the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I don't think you will want to do it."" 

I felt trapped by what my family wanted. I saw many jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore them. But I didn't want to upset my dad. I was not as scared of him as my brother Maurice was, but I still found him strong. 

""It's too soon to know,"" I said quietly. 

""I tell you, you will not want to join us,"" my dad said. ""It's a pity because you have the skills."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling sad. My dad laughed. We both knew Maurice did not like the business. 

""Anyway,"" I said, ""you could use me as a consultant."" My mother was not around to help us. She died when I was young, and my dad raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him. I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived well. We had a big house in London, nice schools, good clothes, and fun events. My dad knew many important people, and our house was always busy with interesting talks. 

""I tell you what,"" my dad said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford. Then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some money and help me."" 

""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making big choices right now. I didn't want to see my dad sad if I disagreed with him. 

So, I helped out during my last term at school and during breaks from university. I became a smart student with my own small house, a nice car, and good clothes. I even had a special black dress for my final exams. 

In my last term, my dad came to see me. He took me to a village for a meal and a talk. My teacher said I would get a First Class degree in Law. I felt ready and confident. 

Then my dad told me he needed me to do one last important job for the family business. He said it was the most important job ever, and it would be worth it for me. 

""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on that. It's really important!"" 

I could see my dad did not understand how important my exams were. He would think I was being unkind if I said no. As he talked about the job, I saw how focused and strong he was. He was very good at his work, and I admired that. It made my own plans feel less important. 

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello bought a house in Pembroke Square with his wife, Lois. After a year, he thought it was a mistake. They needed to save money, but at first, buying the house seemed like a good idea. Simon had many successful cases at work, and Lois returned to her job after having twins. She earned a good salary, and she wanted to move to a bigger place because their flat was too small for their family.

Lois wanted a nice home because she thought it was important for their status. She decided that one of them should take public transport to save money, and Simon had to do it because Lois's job was far away. The train rides were crowded, and Simon often felt unhappy and jealous.

He remembered his grandfather's house, where he felt safe and cared for. His grandmother always took care of the family. But things were different now. Lois wanted her career to be as important as Simon's. They needed both of their salaries to pay for the house and their lifestyle.

One day, a woman named Venetia came to their office. She was very angry about something. Simon wished he had left his room earlier to avoid her. Venetia accused him of not doing the right thing in a past case. She said a man named Brian Cartwright claimed Simon knew he had bribed jurors but did nothing about it. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty and nervous.

He wanted to explain that he didn't believe Cartwright, but instead, he lied. He saw the disbelief in Venetia's eyes and felt ashamed. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. He was scared that if people heard the rumors, it could ruin his career."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be alone. I wanted to be around people who did not care about broken houses or messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon recognize me. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens can be nice. I usually stay inside, but tonight I watch the birds flying. I cut some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms feel itchy from the work. 

It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to live. My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window. She is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work. She has a new story, and I have a copy. ""How is your work going?"" I ask her. She complains about her job. ""I have something to drink in the fridge. I will bring it down,"" she says. I do not want her in the garden, and I see it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. 

She sits in the garden and talks about her life. ""What are your plans for the holidays?"" she asks. I feel worried about the empty days ahead. I think about going to the park and feeling lonely. ""I am going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?"" I ask. ""Of course,"" Jaz replies. ""Where will you stay?"" she asks. ""I will stay with my friend Ruby,"" I say, but it is not true. 

Jaz asks about her story, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans."" I like the title. I think red vans can be cruel because they bring gifts to other people. I decide to give Jaz some advice. ""Try writing about nice people,"" I say. She does not like my advice. ""I keep a journal and write something good every day,"" I tell her. She laughs at me. 

When we go inside, I feel calm in my kitchen. But then I remember my old teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who once winked at us and said, ""I've had my moments."" We all laughed."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage means the things we get from our past. It helps people feel connected to their history. We often know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about our past helps us understand our future. Heritage is important because it gives us a sense of belonging. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit our culture from our families. Some parts of our heritage may not be good, but it is still a part of us. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our happiness. It includes our customs and the things we make. 

In the past, we learned about our history through stories from our ancestors. But now, many of these stories are lost. We can learn about our past from old buildings and places. It is important to take care of these places to remember our ancestors.

**The Fens**

I wrote a book called *Waterland*. In this book, I wrote about a place in England called the Fens. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and quiet. But when I learned more, I found out that the Fens are interesting and different. Many people in England think the Fens feel strange, even though they are part of England. The Fens are both empty and full, and they are both farmed and wild. 

I have not visited some places in the Fens, but I like to imagine what they are like. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, they just put things in glass cases with long labels. Now, museums should be more interesting and fun. They can use different ways to show their items and make people feel something. 

Museums should help everyone enjoy their collections. For example, they can give boxes of objects to teachers or help elderly people who forget things. Museums show real items from history, not copies. This is what makes them special. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will attract more visitors who want to see real history.

**Architecture and Environment**

Wanting to keep things safe is not new. But now, changes in our towns happen very fast. This can make some people want to protect old things. People who lived through big events, like wars, may want to keep things stable. If we need to preserve things, planners should think about this. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask people to name a scientist, many will say Albert Einstein. His picture is used to sell things like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did. They know he made important ideas called ""relativity."" These ideas are famous but hard to understand. Einstein helped change how we think about science in the 20th century. Scientists wanted to understand the universe better by looking at how things work together. Einstein looked at basic ideas like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, Isaac Newton said that stars and planets moved in a fixed way. Einstein said that time and space are not fixed; they can change.

**Young Readers**

When we were kids, my sister Lydia and I did not like books that won prizes. We thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this and would tell us to read better books. Our father would give us money for each chapter we read. He also gave us some special books for Christmas and birthdays. He wrote on them, ""This Book is NOT Literature."" We thought many of his books were for boys, but he did help us read some good stories and poems.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the start of human language is a secret and amazing thing. Many people have strange ideas about how language began. Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. People in the past made sounds when they were in danger, and some words today still show this, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" and ""mors"" in Latin meaning ""death."" Many people thought these ideas were silly, but now, studying how language started is important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech to be friendly and to help with power struggles. Sharing information was not the main reason for language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Most reviews are short and do not last long. They have deadlines and must be a certain length. When they are published, they are only in the newspaper for a short time, like a day or a week.

People often think that writing reviews is not important. They believe that writers only do it for money or because they cannot work on their main books all day. But writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of 600 or 800 words than to write a longer one of 6,000 or 8,000 words. 

A reviewer must think about who will read the review. Some readers just want a quick look, while others want to read a serious article. A good reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that is easy to understand.

Many reviewers also write other things, not just reviews. For example, the American writer John Updike writes novels but also writes reviews. He collects all his reviews into books, even if they are short.

Some people think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews are not very important. But if they believe their best writing is in reviews, they should be proud of it. 

I have mostly worked in academics, and my serious books are for professors. In English-speaking countries, it is common for the same people to write reviews and study literature. 

In the past, some academics did not like professors who wrote reviews. But now, it is more accepted. There are many reviews today, so many people can write them. This is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. 

Writing reviews helps professors remember to explain things clearly to everyone, not just to other professors. They should not use difficult words when talking to smart readers who are not professors. 

In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a side job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,"Ralph opened the door to his flat. It was dark and quiet inside. He felt a small happiness to be home, even after three years. When he first bought the flat, he was always excited to come back. He wondered what the flat had been doing while he was away. It felt like a special place just for him. 

Sometimes, he worried about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat was always there, waiting for him. It looked different depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to think of it as part of himself. He wanted to change it, but it stayed the same. 

There were always letters by the door and a blinking answering machine when he got home. He was happy that nothing was broken in his flat. From his office, he often looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After a long day at work, he wanted to be alone, but he also felt lonely. 

He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and more sure of himself. After university, he tried to make a plan for his life, but he just wanted to get by. 

He applied for jobs that his friends talked about. He felt tired and followed them, hoping to find happiness. He went to one job interview and was happy to talk with Neil, the boss. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who applied. Ralph took this as a compliment."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse. I pushed my way through the crowd to find a good place to watch. 

They made a special area for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few goats in order. This was not easy because goats like to eat anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I felt scared about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we could not find a place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we saw the cliffs. Our flashlight was getting weak, so we changed the batteries, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp.

After a while, Lesley saw a light far away, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard loud water, but we could not see it. We kept moving on.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a manager, I have to present to my team and important people. How can I get better and feel more confident?

You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company. Many managers need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you say. Show your passion and enthusiasm. 

This means you need to prepare well. Think about your ideas and ask your colleagues what hard questions the audience might ask. You should also start with something everyone can relate to and then lead to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities take time. You cannot hurry them. If you are late for a meeting, you can rush. But if you are too quick with mayonnaise, it will not be good. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get worse. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very fast, but others take a long time. 

We can get better at some things, like solving puzzles. But some things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they will not work well. For example, you cannot sleep well in a short time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds.

There are three speeds of thinking. The first is very fast. Sometimes we need to react quickly. For example, if you fall off a bike, your body knows what to do before you think about it. This fast reaction is called our ""wits.""

The second speed is thinking. This is when we solve problems and make decisions. A mechanic fixing a car or a student doing homework is using this kind of thinking. We call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are often called ""clever.""

The third speed is slower. This is when we think in a relaxed way. We might daydream or think about things without a clear goal. For example, sitting by the sea and listening to the waves is a different way of thinking. This slow thinking is also important. 

Taking time to think slowly is good for us. Sometimes, we need to think slowly to understand complicated problems. If we are not sure what to do, it is better to sit and think than to rush. This slow thinking can help us be creative and wise. 

Poets and philosophers know that slow thinking is important. Scientists are now studying how our minds work slowly. They find that our minds can solve problems and understand things better when we give them time."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed nicely. It is a friendly place in a very remote area. There are about forty people here - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite workers. We all help each other. My French is okay for talking, but not good for chatting. I miss some words, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt shy. I was a little scared at mealtimes. I did not know which table to sit at, and I felt nervous when I spoke. I still smile a lot or feel scared when people talk to me. I think I feel this way because I am not as confident as I used to be.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was a young writer. He did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he would not see me. But then I became a successful playwright, and Elliot started to be nicer to me. One day, he invited me to lunch. I thought he wanted to get to know me better. After my success, I met him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film director. He said he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and the music. He believed that good films make people feel strong emotions, no matter where they are from. If a film is made well, people in Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock was very smart and knew a lot about making films. He wanted to make people scream with excitement. He focused only on the film itself and how it could affect the audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good, and there were few books to help people. Now, there are many types of telescopes and equipment to buy. Computers and calculators help make charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 

But some things are worse now. People may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky. In the past, it was easier to see stars in cities. Now, there are many airplane trails in the sky that can last for hours. These trails make it hard to see the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices. People have many things to do and many options. In our modern world, people want new products and services all the time. Technology makes this faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be hard to keep up. This can make people feel tired and stressed. 

Many people want to find simple things that make them happy in a complicated world. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many choices. There are many brands of soap and breakfast cereals, and many phone plans and software updates. 

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family goes to McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a tradition started by my grandmother. It is very important to us. We do not want anything to change this tradition. 

The guests at McAndrews Hotel are special. Some people might think we are old-fashioned or snobbish. I do not like rude shop assistants or waiters who act too friendly. I know many of the other guests because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them, we only say hello. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
There is a great show of Shakespeare's play Othello in London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show started last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the main role, and I did not like his acting. I still think Othello and Desdemona should be different ages, but I was wrong about Mr. Fearon's great performance. The whole cast is wonderful. Some memorable scenes are when Cassio plays games with other young officers, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The show is exciting and full of tension. You should see this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In Antarctica, there is nothing alive in the middle. There are penguins, seals, and birds on the edges, but not in the center. However, there is a big hidden lake called Lake Vostok under 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been without air and sunlight for 25 million years. Scientists are very excited to explore this lake and find out what strange life is there. For two years, researchers from around the world have been trying to learn the secrets of this lake. Soon, we may see many discoveries about Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn about everything, from tiny atoms to big black holes. They also wonder why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than worry about why we want to know. Science is a tool, and we should decide how and when to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Food is very important to us. Many people who like to cook buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special days or fancy meals. But that is not true! You can make a tasty soup by putting chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and some herbs in water. This soup is better than buying a packet or a tin. You can also make a yummy dessert in five minutes that both adults and kids will enjoy. Cooking is a way to show care and love. Sharing food is special. We celebrate important days like birthdays and anniversaries with food. No one wants to eat takeout at a wedding!

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but it was still messy. Papers were everywhere, and he had many tax forms to organize. He knew Mallory would come on time for their meeting. She was always on time and liked things neat. He worried she would think his office was a mess. His cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, came while he was trying to clean. He smiled at her, hoping she would help, but she looked unhappy and went into her own space. She thought he was not from her world.

**Karen**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She made her own story about strength. One important moment was when she was twelve years old. Her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the doctor said she was okay. She only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, she felt grateful and knew she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was happy and sad as she walked across the village green. She was excited to know something important in her small town, but she was also sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years and always cared for her. She remembered how he listened to her problems and made her feel like he had time for her. This made everyone in the village love him. He gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received their loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. She also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. 

Joanna plays the piano very well. She can play many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. One time, at a concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This made Joanna laugh. She thought it was funny that the boy wanted to hear that song. 

Joanna cares a lot about how children learn to play the piano. She has written a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" to help kids learn. Even though she is very busy, she wants to help children enjoy music. 

When Joanna was younger, she taught many kids how to play the piano. She remembers how much fun it was to play music with them. She believes that everyone should be able to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. 

Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time. Joanna knows that some children stop playing because they feel too much pressure from their parents. She thinks music should be fun, not just about being the best. 

Joanna's books are colorful and fun. They have stories and music to make learning easier. She wants kids to enjoy playing the piano. She believes that practice is very important. 

Joanna understands that some children find it hard to practice. She wants to help them by making practice fun. She says it is good to play a piece of music, even if there are mistakes. 

In the end, Joanna wants all children to love music and enjoy learning the piano."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson said that if writing is easy, people do not enjoy reading it. Good writing takes effort. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not make many mistakes. Now, I would change them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard. Writing slowly helps me think better. When I write by hand, I take care with my words. But when I use a computer, I can write quickly, and this can make my writing messy. 

Many writers spend a lot of time fixing their work on a computer. Writing emails is different from writing letters by hand. Emails can be quick and easy, but they can also feel less special. Many people now write love letters by email. This is good because at least they are writing. But words on a screen can feel boring. People often do not think carefully about what they write, and their messages can be confusing. 

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not nice, but the shiny disc inside looked cool. Mr. Warriston came back and said, ""These are amazing!"" I agreed and gave him the disc. He said, ""It is amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on this."" He turned on the music player, and lights turned on. He opened a little drawer, put the disc inside, and closed it again. 

""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" he said. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked surprised and then thought for a moment. ""I don’t know. You could make both sides work,"" he said. He smiled at me. ""Good question!"" 

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were made after lighters, we would think matches were old. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the printing press. But this is not true. It takes a long time for people to change how they think. 

Reading long things on a screen is not fun for most people. They usually do not do it. Computers make people read only parts of texts. Some people say this is good because it creates new ways to tell stories. But many books have always been read in parts, like religious texts and poetry. The problem is that computers do not help people read everything from start to finish.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw everything was neat. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered. Files were in their right places. Kathleen was trying to close a filing cabinet. She looked at him and said, ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much work."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. This place is amazing!"" he said, looking at the old furniture. He did not want to think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She did not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers. She could use software to create new things easily."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was saying a fact because she had made Lancelot coffee for many months. She forgot things because he was not usually there. But now, he was there all the time. He learned that staying away only caused problems. 

He thought about how he went from a helpful person who met authors for lunch to someone who was always busy and had no place to park when he got to work. 

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that man in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one. 

Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was a friend who Lancelot had asked to write books. Ian was known for being hard to work with. Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. It seemed like Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis was not as good as it should be, and it felt like Ian had lost his ideas. 

Lancelot remembered a famous author who had published an unfinished book after he died. But that author had never received any money. Ian had received a lot of money, which was not how things should work. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising writer. He had many ideas but never shared them. While other writers became successful, Ian stayed quiet. 

Ian was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. He had a contract with a fashion magazine, but it also did not produce anything. At meetings, Ian was mean and made fun of other people's ideas. Now, ten years later, Lancelot thought that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Change**

A good breakfast is very important, say health experts. But breakfast is a new idea in England. In the past, people did not often write about breakfast. Some travelers ate a meal early in the morning before long trips. Sick people sometimes had breakfast to feel better. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or rich people.

In the sixteenth century, more people started to eat breakfast. This happened because there was more food available. Some people think this is the only reason. But there were also big changes in society. More people had jobs with set hours. Many of these jobs started very early in the morning. So, eating breakfast became necessary for everyone, not just for rich people."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, feelings, and experiences. It also depends on the culture around them. In this book, we will learn how these things change the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also see how people look at and feel about these pictures. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they understand the photos in it. But we can ask if the photo shows the truth of what happened. Does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the moment in the photo very important, or does it mean something bigger about the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you must focus only on your goal. Sports can be tough, and no one will do it for you. You must work hard. Sports teach me discipline and how to work with a team. My sport lets me shine as an individual, but it is also a team sport. This is like life - you can do well alone, but you must remember others are with you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me many things in the world. But you also have to give up a lot to get these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some memories are very clear and special. For me, one special memory is from a night in California. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing in a tree. I was not awake because I could not sleep; I was awake because the bird sang beautifully. As I listened to the bird, I felt like I was in a special musical place. The bird's songs reminded me of jazz and Indian music. It felt like a wonderful performance. I enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

People have always talked a lot about birds. They love them, fear them, and admire them. But what does this mean for us? 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Is it trying to tell me something, or is it just stuck? It could be both. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, we still see wrens in pictures and decorations in many homes. Even if old beliefs are not as strong now, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels sad. 

Long ago, people understood nature differently. They needed to know about animals and birds to survive. This helped them create stories and meanings about birds. 

For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a helpful bird in London. It would take food from children. But later, people thought it was a pest and many were killed. Now, red kites are protected again and are important for conservation in Britain. 

Birds are important to us for many reasons. They can show us when danger is near or when the weather is changing. Birds also connect us to our dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about who we are. Birds can fly, sing, and seem free. This makes us feel a connection to nature. 

Some people think our feelings about birds are not important anymore. But these feelings are still part of us. Losing them would be hard. 

In recent years, birds have shown us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means we are losing not just birds, but also part of our culture. 

Certain birds, like the skylark and turtle dove, represent love and magic in stories and poems. Losing these birds makes us feel sad. But we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not in stories. 

Stories about birds are important. They connect us to the past and help us feel emotions that are hard to express. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be explained by science. 

The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a long history. Its song reminds us of the past and makes us think about the future."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map shows where things are on the earth. It helps us understand how far apart places are and which way to go. Long ago, people talked about distance in time, like ""it takes two hours to walk"" or ""it is a day's trip by boat."" This helped people know how easy it was to travel, not just how far it was.

Direction is also important, but for many travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, maps were not always very accurate about direction. For a long time, people used written directions instead of maps. Some maps, like train maps, still do not show true directions.

In the past, important places were marked with signs. The size of the signs showed how important the place was. Different maps used different signs, so it is important to understand what each map means.

Over time, maps became more accurate. People learned to use tools like the compass to find direction. They also learned more about the world through exploration. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect ball, which helped make better maps.

More people started using maps, not just travelers. Soldiers needed accurate maps for battles. This led to new ways of showing land features. Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work.

Today, map makers create maps for many things, like weather and land use. Maps are very important in many sciences. There have been times when map making improved quickly and times when it did not change much. Old maps can still be useful, but they may not always show the latest information.

The many maps we have today show a lot of human effort and thought. They are important for understanding our history. This is why studying old maps is interesting and helpful."
CPE_35,"**Text:**

I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had a nice room full of records and a piano. Andrew was very talented. He wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I wanted to be a pop star for fun, money, and fame. 

Andrew asked me to write lyrics for his music. I thought it was a good idea because he played me some of his songs, and they were really good. I had only one song that I wrote, but it did not do well. We decided to meet again and write music together.

I was still more interested in pop music than in musicals, but I knew Andrew was special. I thought he would be very successful soon. I also thought we could try to write songs for famous bands like The Beatles.

The next day, I went back to my job as a lawyer. I felt less excited about music, but I still wanted to see Andrew again. He was interesting and talked about many things. He had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who helped orphans. 

I was not sure about the story, but Andrew believed in it. He played me his music, and I started to write funny lyrics for the songs. I even skipped work one day to write. That day, I did not know it, but I was starting a new career in music."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I can talk to each other. This is a special skill that humans have. We use language every day. When people are together, they usually talk. If someone is alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think talking is like an instinct. This means we know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs. 

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather come from the air around us. They are very important for animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places have tropical jungles with many different plants and animals. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day because of moving air. The sun also helps to move the air.

**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and make coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant needs good coffee to be successful. I had many days of training to learn how to use the coffee machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. After a week, I realized that making coffee is not easy. I thought I might have to do other jobs again. But my boss was kind. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science. You need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does TV not show art well? Painting and sculpture are good for TV because the camera can show the whole art piece and also show the details. But there are not many TV shows that show the joy and details of art. 

One example is Robert Hughes's show about American art called ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trusted critic. He has a strong personality and talks for almost eight hours about American art that British galleries do not show. I thought the show would be about great art pieces. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer. I became known for taking risks. The metals market is not controlled as much as other markets. With some luck and knowledge, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this job. 

But now, the free-trade experts who said the market would keep metal prices high are wrong. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the prices are going down. If we think about inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I looked into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**A Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. They go from Florida to Cuba. Each island is different and has something special. To travel around the islands, you need a boat. If your hotel does not give you a boat, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go by yourself. 

Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called ""The Sailing Capital of the World"" because of its calm waters. These waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches go for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**

You can build your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by two engineers, James Marr and Ian McMillan. You will get a special bike frame made by a computer and have a fun weekend building your bike.

It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can build a bamboo bike. I went to see how it works. There is a lot of energy and fun in the workshop.

Bamboo is a new and interesting material for making bikes. Some companies, like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire, have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. But these bikes can be very expensive. A ready-made bamboo bike frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868. 

James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes that everyone can afford. They worked for many years in a shed in Wales to create a business. They wanted to help people enjoy making their own bikes. Now, they run the Bamboo Bike Club as a fun project while they have other jobs. James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.

At the workshop, you can take a course to build your own bike. You will learn how to choose strong bamboo and how to put the pieces together. The first step is to make the front part of the bike with thick bamboo. They also use metal tubes for parts that need to be strong.

James and Ian help everyone in the workshop. They check every cut and joint to make sure it is good. If someone has a problem, they help them fix it. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, but that is okay. You can just try again with another piece of bamboo.

On Sunday, you will spend time making the bike stronger with special bindings. At the end, you will add wheels, brakes, and other parts to finish your bike. The bamboo bike is strong and can last a long time. James has used his bike for over a year, and Ian has tested his bike for three months.

The bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They may not look as perfect, but they are unique. James and Ian say that is what makes them special. I think these bikes are good for riding slowly and enjoying the ride.

When I tried James's bike, it felt light and smooth. It was fun to ride, even on bumpy roads. James says these bikes are easy to ride and very enjoyable. The best part? You can build your own bamboo bike for less than £500!"
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend worked as an editor at Random House in New York. One day, she saw a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the book would be very popular, and she was right. Now, Dr. Gray is very rich, and Dione has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps men and women talk to each other better. This book is part of a big self-help industry in America. Many people want to improve their lives, and this industry helps them. 

In Britain, many self-help books are published, but many are not good. For every self-help book that is published, many others are not accepted. Editors look for books that will sell well. They ask questions like, ""Can we sell this book?"" and ""Does it have a good title?"" A good title can help a book become popular.

**Autobiographies**

When someone writes an autobiography, they should tell the truth. But sometimes, they do not tell everything. They might feel ashamed or think some things are not important. Sometimes, they might change the truth to make a better story. They might call it an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. 

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Dashiell Hammett wrote detective stories. These stories show problems in society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In these stories, a crime shows human feelings like greed. Solving the crime helps bring order back to society. In Hammett's stories, both the detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is a little bit of both a good person and a bad person. He sometimes feels guilty about his job, but he also wants to catch the bad guys.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. He believes that only scientists can write well about science. If you do not understand science, you cannot write about it well. Gould says that writers should not talk down to their readers. They can use simple words, but they must keep the main ideas clear. If readers feel that the writer is being disrespectful, they will not enjoy the writing."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, it is cold inside. Many workers from the City of London come here for lunch. This summer is very hot, so the gym uses a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic! This shows how we use air-conditioning too much. It is now a big part of our lives. Many buildings with air-conditioning can be cooler in other ways. They can use sunlight and fresh air. They can also have thicker walls to keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
Now, many people are interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks became better, sundials were just for decoration in gardens. Now, people care about them again. David Harber makes sundials. He thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. When he delivers a sundial, it feels magical when it starts to work. Sundials are calm and beautiful, reminding us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
I remember seeing china-painting at an art show. Older women painted flowers on teacups very carefully. It was amazing to watch them. Their hands were steady, and the paint was perfect. I thought it would be hard to learn. But when I went to a china-painting class, it was fun! Everyone was there to enjoy themselves. Even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I saw before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, a beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk said they would be with a school group from the south coast. This group was learning Italian.

But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss in Switzerland, not Venice. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard older people speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there was a mistake.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. They did not see anything about an overnight stop in the brochure. When they got off the coach, it was almost midnight. They were tired and did not ask about their beds. But the next morning, they learned they would stay in the hotel for their whole holiday. This made them worried.

Keith told the receptionist, ""We were supposed to be in Venice."" The receptionist did not know about Venice. He said, ""You are booked here for twelve nights."" Dawne said the name of the travel agency and described the man who helped them. 

Then a woman named Mrs. Franks came over. She was the same woman they saw at Gatwick. Dawne told her they were in the wrong hotel. Keith said they followed the girl with the yellow-and-red label. 

Mrs. Franks explained that there are many different holidays with the same labels. She laughed and said they could end up anywhere if they just followed others. Keith insisted, ""We are not meant to be in Switzerland.""

Mrs. Franks then walked away. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. Dawne said Mrs. Franks seemed nice, but Keith was thinking about everything that happened. 

An old man named Mr. Nottage spoke to them. He and his wife were happy and said they had a good sleep. Dawne said that was nice. Keith and Dawne left the hotel. They did not say it out loud, but they found it funny that they ended up on a holiday with older people when they wanted to relax away from them. Uncle had said this when they tried to get him to come with them."
CPE_48,"**He Was a People Person**

American business leaders are looking to Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Many people in Britain know who Shackleton was and what he did. In America, people are just starting to learn about him. This year, the Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer"" who was not well-known for most of the 20th century. Now, Americans are very interested in him. 

Books and stories about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being made. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is in the works. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions and learn lessons about leadership and communication from him. 

Shackleton was determined and resourceful. He had a special sleeping bag and a stove made from animal fat. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for many years. His company helps with communication during business changes and crises. MacGregor says that even if a company handles a crisis well, it can still hurt itself if it communicates poorly. Shackleton is a good model for management because he was a strong leader and communicator. He cared about his team and made tough decisions, like turning back when he was very close to the South Pole to keep his men safe.

In 1908, Shackleton led an expedition to the South Pole. When they were only 97 miles away, he decided to turn back because they were running out of supplies. In a crisis, people want a leader. While some managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton stood up and took charge. His 1914 expedition became famous. His ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months and was eventually crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men to trust him and do their best to stay safe.

Shackleton always planned carefully and kept his men informed. He was flexible and ready to change plans if needed. MacGregor says that Shackleton's story helps clients understand important principles without feeling criticized. Shackleton believed that an explorer needs to be optimistic, strong, and patient. 

MacGregor explains that in tough times, it is hard to wait for things to get better, especially in America. If you make a bad investment, it is better to wait than to sell and lose money. Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he gave his gloves to a cold photographer. He once did something similar with a biscuit when they were very hungry. He said he would leave the biscuit in the snow because it was so valuable.

Caroline Alexander, who wrote about Shackleton's expedition, says that people today want to hear stories of heroism. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare now, and he represents the ideals that many people long for today."
CAE_15,"**Simplified Text:**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is a primate, and it has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long finger to reach inside and get the insects.

Scientists have studied the aye-aye to understand how it finds insects. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University watched three aye-ayes: two males named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood.

Dr. Erickson made logs with small holes. Some holes had food inside, and some did not. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food. They did not need to see the holes to find the food. They might have used their sense of smell or sound, but tests showed they did not need these senses either. They could find food even when it was silent or when the smell was blocked.

Dr. Erickson found that the aye-ayes could feel the empty spaces in the wood. When they look for food, they tap the wood with their long finger and listen carefully. They might be using a method called echo-location, which helps them find hollow spaces in the wood.

The aye-aye is interesting because it acts like both a woodpecker and a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing like a squirrel's teeth. Recently, scientists saw an aye-aye in the wild eating nuts. It used its long finger to get the nut meat out of the shell."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have pictures of our grandparents. But how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Sometimes, we can read old diaries or hear family stories, but they are often not complete. What will our grandchildren know about us? We want to write things down, but we often forget to do it. We might make videos instead of taking pictures, but videos are still not the same as real life.

Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book that has at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. She tells the stories of ordinary people, not famous ones. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family and saw that many stories from the past were being lost.

""When I started, I did not think it was very important,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have interesting lives and want to share their stories. They say they do it for their children, but they also enjoy it.""

People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I talked about my divorce, and it still hurts."" He wrote his story for his family, but he has not let his children read it yet. He wants to protect them from some painful details.

Hannah sees that many people are affected by their childhood. ""Many people repeat the same mistakes they made when they were young,"" she says. ""They often marry people their parents liked or choose the opposite to rebel.""

Many people have regrets about their past. Even after many years, they still feel sad about things that happened with their parents. They try to impress parents who were never happy with them.

Hannah listens to their stories without judging. ""I am not here to be nosy,"" she says. People sometimes share things and then worry if they should have said them. But Hannah usually keeps everything in the story. People want to be honest.

Hannah's books are not for everyone to read. They are personal stories. She believes it is important to remember the past. People want to feel connected to their family history because families do not spend as much time together anymore.

Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story. She can make the book look nice, and people can choose the color and title. The final book is well-made and costs about £3,000, with extra copies for £25 each. Many people ask about her service, but the price stops some from buying.

""I thought more people would want this,"" she says. ""But the people I work with are often wealthy and want to leave something special for their family."""

A. **The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange life, but I have been lucky to have 35 years with small children. I love being a father. This morning, I fed the baby, and it made me very happy. My children and I enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. Now that they are older, we are more like friends. I do not believe in hitting children. I have done it when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I always try to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. I do not want to make them feel guilty for not calling.

B. **The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, about 25 years old. It was hard for me at first, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new things like music and fashion.

But now, we can go on holidays together, and they enjoy being with my friends at parties.

C. **The Politician**  
My first child was born when I started my job in politics. I wanted to spend time with my children, but it has been hard because I am very busy.

More politicians are bringing their kids to work, which is good.

D. **The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I wanted to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, but it was confusing for the kids. Kate says I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated them like adults too soon. Kate thinks I was too easy on them. I wish I had set more rules. I still worry about my daughters, no matter how old they are.

E. **The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home. We thought it would be better to have a child than to keep buying new things. Having my daughter, Betty, made me think about who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but when I see her smile, all my worries go away. A baby's smile can make anyone feel better."

CAE_46,"**Text: Science and Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford went with students to test their ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. It was a Boeing KC-135, made in 1964. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights. Most seats were gone, except for a few at the back where the students sat nervously. 

For a year, these 13 students from Europe and America worked hard to join this flight. The European Space Agency asked them to think of fun experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which felt like a big roller coaster. 

For two hours, the plane flew up and down like a bird. When the pilot turned off the engines at 3,000 meters, the plane went higher for a moment. Then, it fell back down. During this time, everything inside the plane became weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.

The plane took off smoothly, but soon the pilot made it climb steeply. The engines roared, and the students felt heavy. Then, the engines stopped, and they floated in the air. It was like jumping on a trampoline. They could not tell which way was up or down. 

After a short time, the pilot brought the plane back down. Some students landed hard when gravity returned. They had 30 curves to fly, giving them 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments. 

The Dutch students studied their robot cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. They released a device to help with this. A German team looked at how metal joins change without gravity, which is important for building space stations. Another group from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films in microgravity. They hope these sails can use sunlight like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying, the students felt excited, not sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I want to be an astronaut even more now."""
CAE_3,"**Title: Planting Trees in New Zealand**

Jonathon Porritt is a writer. He wrote a book called ""Seeing Green."" 

Jonathon had a strange time in his life. He did not have any summers. He went to New Zealand every summer, but it was winter there. He had nine winters in a row, which he liked because he enjoys winter.

His parents had an idea. They wanted to buy a small piece of land for Jonathon and his brother and sister. His mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, they would always have a connection to New Zealand. Jonathon's father grew up there.

They found land about 20 miles from Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was good for planting trees. Jonathon liked land a lot. He had worked in Australia on farms, so he was excited to plant trees. His family also became excited.

Jonathon started planting trees in 1968. By 1972, he and his siblings had planted 70 acres of trees. In 1968, it rained a lot. It was cold and wet while they planted trees. Every morning, it was hard to get ready to work in the rain. Jonathon had a helper who knew how to plant trees. This was good because Jonathon had never done it before.

He used a bag to carry trees. When the bag was full, it was heavy. It was easier when the bag was lighter. The hardest part was making straight lines to plant the trees. They used poles to help with this. Once they were in line, they planted trees until they reached the end, then turned around and came back.

Jonathon liked the hard work. It made him strong. After a while, he could plant trees easily. He learned a rhythm for planting. He took the tree from the bag, dug a hole, put the tree in, and moved on. While planting, he thought a lot about nature and life.

Jonathon went back to New Zealand four times after that. He saw the trees grow, which made him happy. He worried when he read about bad weather in New Zealand. But the trees grew well and are now 20 years old.

In 1984, Jonathon took time off from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. He wrote his first book there. He stayed in a simple cabin with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, he wrote. In the afternoons, he took care of the trees. He felt a strong connection to that place. It was important to him because it linked people and the earth."
CAE_10,"**Taking Care of Badger Cubs**

One day, I saw a helper bring me a cardboard box. I was curious because I heard strange noises from the box. When I looked inside, I saw three small grey badger cubs. They were about eight inches long and had soft fur. Their eyes were white, and they had black-and-white stripes on their heads. I had never seen badger cubs before.

These cubs were found by builders. The builders accidentally hurt their home while working. The mother badger was dead, but the cubs were alive. They were cold and scared. I took them to my kitchen to keep them warm. I named the two girls Primrose and Bluebell, and the boy was named Willow.

At first, I fed them with a syringe. I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to help them feel like their mother was cleaning them. I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around. They were happy together.

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was not as active. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. It was my fault because I let him drink too fast. I was sad, but I took care of Primrose and Bluebell.

Then, a farmer found another badger cub. He brought it to me. I named him Willow II. He was younger and hard to feed. I had to help him drink from the bottle. After a week, he learned to eat sausages. Soon, all the cubs were eating different foods like cereals, vegetables, and fruits.

By August, the badgers started to go out at night. They loved to play and chase each other. I had to be careful because they sometimes nipped at me. One night, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food. Badgers can be very protective of their homes, so we had to make sure our cubs were safe.

We decided to build a home for the badgers on our farm. My son Daniel helped design it. We built a sett with tunnels and a special gate. Many people helped us with money and materials. Finally, the badgers moved into their new home. 

Now, they are happy in their territory. I don’t see Primrose often because she found another home, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before they run off into the night."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But he also did important work with compasses. He used his sea trips on a warship called Paramore to study the ""variations of the compass."" These variations are now called ""declination."" Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley wanted to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. He first tried to go to the Cape Verde Islands, but the trip ended early because of problems with the crew. He tried again and traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. This work helped sailors for many years.

Now, Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.

Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was at Halley Station in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life. Dr. Clark says, ""Halley had a remarkable life. He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics."" Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.

Dr. Clark wants to honor Halley by recreating his voyage. He will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. The Earth's magnetic field is always changing, so these measurements are important. Dr. Clark says, ""We can use satellites to find true north.""

The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will help with instruments. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his work will fill in any gaps in the satellite's data.

Halley's journey was very important. It was the first scientific expedition at sea, and Halley was the first civilian naval captain to study declination. 

Dr. Clark has experience for this journey. He spent two years in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. He says, ""I am ready to give up eight months for this. Some may think I am obsessed, but Halley has given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show their beautiful tails to the hens. This makes people think about a question that Charles Darwin had: how can birds have such big and colorful tails? Darwin believed that animals change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that the strongest animals survive and have babies. 

But peacocks have big tails that can be heavy and hard to carry. Darwin thought that female peacocks liked beautiful tails just for beauty. His friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if hens liked the peacocks with the biggest tails, there must be another reason. Maybe the peacocks with big tails are also strong or healthy.

Now, 100 years later, scientists are still studying this. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. The scientists want to answer two questions: Do hens really choose the peacocks with the biggest tails? And do these peacocks have other good qualities?

The scientists watch the peacocks and take pictures. They see that hens do like the peacocks with the biggest tails. The number of eye spots on the tail matters. Peacocks with more eye spots attract more mates. But the scientists still need to find out if these peacocks are better in other ways.

One scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that peacocks with big tails might be healthier and have fewer parasites. But the scientists at Whipsnade have not checked this yet. This year, they are looking at the babies of attractive peacocks and less attractive peacocks. They want to see if the babies of the attractive peacocks grow faster and are healthier.

There is also an interesting idea from a mathematician named R A Fisher. He thought that if a female peacock chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their babies will have long tails too. This could make more peacocks with long tails over time. This idea shows that females might choose beauty for beauty's sake, just like Darwin thought."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe says the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He made his own boat called 'The Westerman'. This week, there is a big boat show in London with many beautiful yachts and new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. 

My boat is different. It is quiet and sits in a small creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic person because of this boat. Maybe I am, but I don’t think so. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but it also uses some new technology. 

New technology helps with boat design and building, but it can also make sailors forget about real life at sea. Sometimes, sailors want to feel the real sea life again. I don’t think sailors should go back to having a hard time. I like my boats to have a stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if the sails do everything by themselves? Sometimes, dealing with sails is part of being a sailor. 

A boat should be a boat, not a big house on the water. When I bought my first boat, Hirta, I sailed around Britain for a TV show. The last owner said it had comfort but no luxury. He was right. Hirta had heavy sails and no running water, no electricity, no fridge, no heating, and no electronics. But she was the easiest boat I ever sailed.

However, old boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but could not find one, so I decided to build a new boat. The Westerman has never let me down. 

The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew the boat on a paper napkin. Then he used a computer to make the design better. We made a model like boat builders did in the past. After many changes, the final design was perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. 

The boat looks beautiful, moves well in the sea, and feels peaceful inside. This is because it was made just for sailing, not for putting in furniture. It shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy. The boat is made of wood that keeps water out, so it has the good parts of a fiberglass boat but still feels like a real boat."

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

Humans and chimpanzees have a lot in common. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means that the differences between us and animals are very small and new. 

Many studies show that animals can do things we thought only humans could do. For example, chimpanzees use sticks to eat and to fight. Sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have simple sounds to warn each other about danger, like leopards and snakes. 

So, what makes human art special? For a long time, our ancestors did not make art. The first art we know about is from about 35,000 years ago. This art includes cave paintings, statues, and musical instruments. 

Some people say human art is different because:

1. Human art is not made to help us survive. It is made for enjoyment. Animals make sounds to find mates or protect their homes. This is important for their survival.
   
2. Human art is made for beauty. We do not know if animals enjoy their songs. They sing mostly during mating season, so they might not sing just for fun.

3. Human art is learned. Each culture has its own style of art. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. Animals, like birds, are born knowing how to sing their songs. 

There are also some interesting examples of animal art. Two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, made many paintings. They painted for fun, not to communicate with other chimps. Their art was shown in a gallery in London, and many people bought their paintings. 

This shows that the line between human art and animal behavior is not so clear. Both humans and animals can create art for their own enjoyment."
CAE_39,"**A Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very big and dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed this desert and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left in the world. In the past, stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and narrow eyes looking into the distance. Now, we do not see these heroes in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Charles Blackmore led a group to cross the Taklamakan Desert. The name means ""once you enter, you never come out,"" and local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of this amazing journey while at home with his family. His team had four British people, one American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous for everyone.

They set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He wanted to have fun and find out who he really was. His wife, Tina, was worried he might not come back because no one had ever crossed that route before. It took them 59 days to go from west to east, and the desert was nice to them.

In his story, Charles talks about the hard times they faced: sickness, extreme heat and cold, and not enough water. They lost some of their water supply. But he said, ""When we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some."" They did not have the famous sandstorms or the freezing cold that could have stopped them. But they still had many problems. The sand got into everything, and climbing the high dunes was very hard for them and the camels.

Charles said, ""What pushed me to keep going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. We were all alone in the sandhills."" He was scared about his strength to finish the trip. On the first day, he felt very hot and thought, ""We have to do this now!"" He was scared.

After walking 1,000 kilometers, they could not stop. They had gone through so much. They were thin but strong. Charles felt fit and could walk easily. In the middle of the book, he wrote about lying in the desert and looking at the full moon, thinking about his family. He felt he needed to find peace inside himself. He said, ""I feel prouder of this trip than anything else I have done. But my family and our happiness are more important.""

Did Charles find peace? He said, ""I want the challenge and the open spaces. We felt good about our purpose. Now, it is hard for me to be part of normal life."""

It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is hard to find a good one. Charles says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now."" He is not happy with some modern furniture. He thinks some furniture-makers do not make good quality furniture. He wants to make perfect furniture, and this is why he is successful. 

Charles is confident in his skills. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his work is for private people. Some clients come back to him many times. He enjoys making furniture for their whole house. 

However, he finds it hard when clients do not know what they want. He likes clients who are clear about their needs. Charles is happy with his work, but he also respects other craftsmen. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" 

He does not like when craftsmen take a long time to make one piece of furniture. He thinks furniture should be useful, not just a fashion statement. Charles is confident, but he is also humble. He says, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" as I leave.'"
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People sleep for about one-third of their lives. Sleep is very important, but we do not know exactly why. Scientists have three main ideas about why we sleep.

The first idea is that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. When we sleep, our bodies fix any damage from the day and get ready for the next day.

The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us remember things we learned during the day. Without sleep, it is hard to learn new things.

The third idea is about energy. This idea says we need sleep to recharge our energy. When we sleep, we get ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, some people like to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to the newspaper about many topics.

Being eccentric shows our uniqueness. Inside us, there are two forces. One is called individualism, which means being yourself. The other is conformity, which means following what others do. Most of the time, we want to fit in and be liked by others. This desire is stronger than wanting to be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs and hold meetings to talk about what they like or their problems. They want to be with others who understand them, even if others think they are strange. Being in a group can make us feel safe.

We all feel a struggle between being ourselves and fitting in. Even when we follow the crowd, we may not like it. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is different. 

Anyone can choose to be more individual. Some people become very successful by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you know what you want to do, go for it and don’t give up."" 

However, being different just to get attention is not true eccentricity. If a pop star wears strange clothes just to be noticed, that is not eccentric. But if they keep being different for a long time, they may become eccentric. 

True eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress others or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives happily, no matter what others think."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four nature experts to tell us about their favorite wildlife books.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy to choose the author. I am an environmental journalist, and I have met many important people in this field. One of them is Barbara Ward. She is a small, thin woman, but she is very important for environmental issues in Europe. She has combined her experiences into her own ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand many things. Choosing her book was harder. I could have picked ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" This book talks about the fast growth of cities and important themes in her life. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books, but none are as good as this one.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of seagulls and remember the smell of the sun. This book explains animal communication very well, with words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a group of seagulls, you will see how they work together. Niko Tinbergen was a great scientist who wanted to share his ideas with everyone. He worked with a talented artist, Eric Ennion, to make this book interesting for all nature lovers. Eric's paintings show how birds act, like when one bird is aggressive and another is calm. This is the work of a true nature expert.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell has changed my life the most. It helped me find a wonderful husband and a great job in conservation. This book made me love the natural world. I was in Madagascar studying animal sounds when I first read it. I had many problems, but when I read this book, I felt happy again. It shows animals and people together in a beautiful world. Some people think humans are bad for nature, but I remember Gerald as a boy, seeing all living things as a family. We need to understand this idea.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library when it was first published in 1966. I loved it right away, especially the beautiful pictures of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and learned to identify birds during my holidays. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had so much more. It had amazing pictures, stories about bird migration, and even a chapter about birds in music and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature more. It showed me that my feelings about nature are just as important as scientific facts. Since I was better at art than math, I felt like I could explore nature in my own way."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in the newspaper. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or displays in shops. Authors feel sad when there are no reviews. Publishers are also unhappy with bad reviews, but they think any review is good because it gets people talking about the book. A review that matches what the publisher thinks is the best.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, especially in a good way. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help people know about the book and the author. A good review from a trusted person can help sell more books.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. Many of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we need reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are better than ads because they show the reader that the review is honest. Good reviews can help a book sell well, but they need help from other things like recommendations from friends and good marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I am not sure how publishing and reviewing work together in Britain. In the United States, one review can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops do not always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews still sell very well. It is hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction books let reviewers talk more about the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they help sell books? I published a biography with great reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. The name of the reviewer used to matter a lot, but now, sometimes a surprising reviewer or a clever review can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

Making weathervanes is an old skill. It started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith makes weathervanes in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes them by hand. 

Graham creates special designs for his customers. He says, ""This way, I can make a unique gift."" Many of his customers are women who want to buy gifts for their husbands. They want something special that shows what their husbands like.

Most weathervanes are shaped like cockerels, but Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. Graham saw that he could make many different designs. 

He decided to start a weathervane business. Before this, he worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed jobs. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of the children and build his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this is exciting.""

Graham has made over 100 original designs. He pays attention to details and always asks the customer if they like the design before he starts cutting. He also keeps some traditional designs because people like them too. 

Graham believes people enjoy handmade items. They want something different. He does not want to grow his business too much because he likes it as a small craft. He says, ""People love unique items, and I feel good when I see a simple shape become something special.""

For many years, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add something special to their homes. This helps crafts like Graham's business.

Graham is busy making weathervanes for customers all over the world. People from America and Denmark are especially interested. He says the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was a very popular book. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. He talks about his ideas and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was not doing well. A film he was working on did not happen. He was sad and worried because he had not made money for two years. He needed money to pay the bank. A smart person would have found a job, but Nicholas did something different. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.

Nicholas had an idea for the story from a farrier he met in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became very angry. The owners were worried until they heard about a gypsy who could talk to the horse and help it. These people are called ""horse whisperers."" Nicholas liked this idea and wanted to write a movie about it. But after the film project failed, he decided to write a book instead.

During the spring, he drove around the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses. He felt alone and worried about his life. He had tried to be a filmmaker for ten years, but now he was in debt and worried about his family.

By the end of August, he had written half of the book. The bank was pressuring him for money, so he showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was good and that Nicholas might get $30,000 for it. Nicholas needed this money to pay off some debt. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had more to write.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the book to seven publishers. Soon, his agent called to say that they had turned down an offer of $75,000. Nicholas was surprised. But then, within a week, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. This was a record for a first novel.

Nicholas could not believe it. He had not even sent the book to New York, but soon big movie studios wanted to make a film from it. His agent in the UK worked with an agent in the US, and they got an offer of $3 million for the movie rights. Nicholas was amazed when he heard this.

One night in October, four famous filmmakers called him to ask for the rights to his unfinished novel. Nicholas decided not to write the movie script himself. He wanted to keep his freedom and not become just an employee. He was happy with how things were going and thought it was a good idea to write another novel."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to chess. He is not young anymore. Chess is now a game for young players. After 20 years away, Bobby Fischer is playing chess again. He is playing against Boris Spassky, his old rival. Bobby won the first game, and it was very good. But he is now 49 years old, and he has not played much. Boris Spassky is also older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Bobby Fischer made chess popular, and now it is more professional. Today, players want to win more than anything else. In chess, a player needs to be strong and calm, not just smart. The game is very intense. Players have a chess clock to keep time. If they do not make their moves in time, they lose.

Now, games can be longer, and players often do not take breaks. This makes it harder for older players. In the last 30 years, new world champions have been younger than the last ones. Most of the top ten players are under 30 years old.

Today, players also prepare a lot before matches. They use computers to study many chess games. A small computer can hold one million games. Players have teams to help them find weaknesses in their opponents. The start of a game is very important, and being well-prepared can help a lot.

There are more great chess players now than ever before. Many grandmasters play for small prizes around the world. A game can last up to eight hours. Players must stay focused, or they can lose. The chess clock makes it even more stressful. At the end of a game, players often rush to make their moves.

Losing is very hard for top players. Winning feels great, but one win is not enough. Players must be ready to play again the next day. Chess tournaments can last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches can be even harder. One match in 1984 had to stop because the players were too tired.

Can Bobby Fischer come back and win? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long break from chess surprising. If he is back for the money, he will earn a lot. But if he wants to prove he is the best, it could be very hard for him."

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, like poets and pop stars, who are becoming famous.

**A** Nick Grosso is a man in his 30s. He has written three plays that people like. Now, he is making his first play, called Peaches, into a movie. He says, ""It is low budget, but I don’t know how low. It will not be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented, but before he wrote Peaches, he had never seen or read a play. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I did not think it would be performed. It is set in a car. I would not do that now because I know it is hard."" He left school at 16 but went back a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He wanted to write for actors because he liked to hear his writing. He says, ""I was happy to be with people who think like me. It was the first time I enjoyed school.""

**B** Simon Pegg is 28 years old. He studied drama at Bristol University. Now, he is writing a comedy show for TV and just finished a tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard. He practiced comedy in clubs while at university. He says, ""University was very theoretical. I realized I did not want to be a serious actor. I like comedy more. People think comedy is very hard, but it is not. If you have courage and good ideas, it is great to make people laugh."" He has worked with Funny Business, but his best work is with Steve Coogan. Simon says, ""He saw my show, and I was a big fan of his.""

**C** Ciaran McMenamin is 24 years old. He became famous when he danced in the show The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. People liked him a lot. He says, ""It has been great for me. Now, I can choose what I want to do."" Ciaran has just finished school, but he has acted for a long time. His mother encouraged him to act. He says, ""I used acting to avoid homework. But then I wanted to do it seriously because I liked it."" Now, he waits for good things to happen, but he thinks about fame. He says, ""When you are 18, you think you will love the photos and interviews, but you learn it is not why you act. It is about respect for good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor is 25 years old and is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix. They just signed a deal to make three albums. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very popular when their song, Chimera, comes out. Neil says, ""The record company wants big sales, but I just want two people to buy it."" Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and tried to get into music for many years. He says, ""I was tired after doing many small gigs. I was about to give up when I met Rick, who helped me start Matrix."" 

**E** Stephen Richards is 27 years old. He is a poet and writer. He has won many awards. He is well-known in poetry and has been reading his work for six years.

He did not go to university at first but changed his mind after working at a theatre. He published his first book, a children's book, in 1992. He says, ""My parents thought I would be a reader, not a writer."" Now, he is brave to write novels. He says, ""Poetry has rules, but novels can be any length. I want to make sure my writing is good."""

CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four writers talk about international volunteer work.

A. It is hard to say that volunteer work helps a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If they gave this money to the local community, it could pay for more help than one person can give. This is especially true for young people who take a gap year. They often do not have special skills or experience. Many studies ask if these young people want to help others or if they just want to make their own careers better. However, these projects can help people learn to care for others in their future jobs.

B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can help solve problems and create connections between people from different countries. When this happens, both the volunteers and the local communities can benefit. But if only rich people can volunteer, it may help them more than the communities they visit. These volunteers may gain experience, but it does not help the people who need it most.

C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to feel good about themselves. It can also be a way to help communities with skills and knowledge. At its best, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the communities. It can also make people aware of problems like poverty and injustice.

D. Volunteer tourism is part of a trend where people want to help others. This can seem good, especially when people do not trust big governments or businesses. But it can also ignore the need for real change in poor communities. Volunteering can be a good thing, but when it is only seen as a way to help without understanding the bigger problems, it can be a problem itself."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports

Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need an alarm to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one?

I, Tom Granger (an inventor), and Paul Bridges (a broadcaster) tested five clock radios. One model has a 'dual alarm function.' This means you can set two different wake-up times. One for work days and one for weekends. But who really needs that? This model costs about the same as another one we tested. It has a cassette player, so you can listen to your own music and wake up without news. We all liked the radio quality, but it is very big, like a rugby ball. Paul said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also likes to book a wake-up call, just in case the alarm does not work.

This model was voted the best. Paul said he loved it, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with nice grey numbers on a green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. But the buttons felt nice to touch, and I accidentally pressed them too much. The clock has a backup battery, so it does not reset if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. However, setting it up was hard, but we felt good when we finally did it.

Tom did not like one model with a built-in lamp. He said it was hard to use. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work. The light was not good for reading; it only shines on the clock. Paul thought the lamp idea was funny, but he said the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm, and I wanted to throw it away.

Another model is very popular. It is bright and colorful, which Tom and I liked. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out. This model was easy to set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 20 minutes early or late. Paul laughed at this and said it was very annoying.

The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easier to set up. With modern buttons, you are not sure if you pressed them right. We thought the tuning was not great, but the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. You can find hedgehogs in many places in the world, but they do not live in America or Australia. When a hedgehog is in danger, it can roll into a tight ball. The spines stick out to protect it. Some hedgehogs live in the desert. They have fewer spines and may try to run away instead of rolling up.

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They like to sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all of them do. Some hedgehogs stay awake all year if the weather is good."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen Winning**

It is hard to be good at any sport, especially for women. They have to work very hard. They train a lot and do not have much time for a normal life. They make sacrifices. But they are winning and breaking records. Here are some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.

A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love to ski and jump in the air. It can be scary sometimes. We train for ten months each year, so I do not see my friends much. But I chose this life. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete together and are treated the same.""

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else! I earn good money as a professional cyclist. I train for at least four hours every day. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""

C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because few schools have rowing teams. Most girls start when they are older, which makes it harder to compete. But I love rowing and being fit. It is also fun to be with friends.""

D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I did not know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very hard. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep. I got a record, but it was painful. Some people think women cannot do this, so they do not want to sponsor us.""

E. **Lisa, 26, Car Racer**  
""Some men think they are better drivers. When I do well, they do not talk to me. Being a woman in racing is hard. I have to be very competitive. Women have been racing for a long time, and now more women are joining.""

F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 AM to swim three times a week. I also cycle and run in the evenings. Sometimes I feel tired at work! Racing is hard, but I feel happy when I am fit. Men and women usually race together, but the news talks more about the men's races. We are working to make things better for women in sports."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso. He was 78 years old and a famous artist. Even from far away, you could see it was him. I was 18 years old and traveling in a broken van around Europe and Morocco. I ran out of money and found a job painting boats. I spent a lot of time drawing and had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso usually stayed at home, so I was surprised to see him at a restaurant with his wife and friends. I was nervous, but I asked him for his signature. He smiled and wrote his name on my paper. Then he drew some fun lines on it too. I was very happy and thanked him. We tried to talk, but his English was not good, and my French was not good either. An American woman helped us talk. She called him ""the Maestro.""

I told Picasso that I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend the signature. He said, ""Is that all? Go back and talk to him more!"" So, I took my sketchbook and went back to Picasso's table.

I didn’t ask him if I could draw his portrait because I was afraid he would say no. Instead, I just started to draw. When Picasso saw me, he made funny faces to distract me. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue. It was hard to draw him, but I wanted to try. After a while, he stopped being silly and let me draw him quietly.

I looked at him closely. He looked strong and young for his age. His eyes were bright and full of life. Even though he was with friends, he seemed to be in his own world. The American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing. I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But he wanted to see it anyway. When I showed it to him, he smiled and nodded.

Then, to my surprise, he took my crayon and drew a picture of me. He did it very quickly and made it look fun. I looked different in his drawing, like a character from a story. I thanked him and asked if he could sign it. The American woman said he said I already had his signature. 

I felt lucky to meet Picasso and to have his attention. It was a special day for me."
CAE_12,"**Shopping Tricks**

Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that stores use to make you spend more money.

A. **Fresh and Nice**  
Stores know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance. Some stores even have bakeries that smell like fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, make people think of fresh food.

B. **Where Things Are**  
The place where products are in the store is very important. Stores use computers to find out where people look for items. They put popular items at eye level so people can see them easily. Special offers are often in big bins to attract buyers.

C. **Moving Around the Store**  
Stores may put cheap items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers see other tempting items on the way. Stores also put popular products far away, hoping customers will look for them and see other things to buy.

D. **Less is More**  
Some stores, like Next, show their clothes in a nice way. They do not put many clothes on the shelves. This makes the clothes look special, even if they are made in large amounts.

E. **Total Price Matters**  
People care more about the total price of their shopping than the price of each item. Stores mix cheap and expensive items to attract customers. Some stores sell cheap items to bring people in, even if they lose money on them.

F. **Price Tags**  
In chain stores, people often buy fewer items and notice prices more. For example, a blouse priced at £14.99 seems cheaper than one at £15. 

G. **Lighting**  
Stores think a lot about lighting. Chain stores use lights that look like natural sunlight so customers can see colors well. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh food look better.

H. **Paths in the Store**  
Many stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. They create paths that lead to sales areas. Some stores use nice carpets to make shoppers feel welcome.

I. **Promotions**  
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of tasty food. In some places, shopping carts have screens that show ads for products while you shop. This is to make you want to buy more things."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington is a famous mountaineer. He climbed Mount Everest in 1985. He has also climbed in Britain and the Alps. He has written many books, like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way.""

Robin Knox-Johnston started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat called Sunhaili. He also set a record for sailing from New York to England in 10 days.

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland. They wrote a book about their trip called ""Sea, Ice and Rock."" In 1979, Chris was working on ""Quest for Adventure."" He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to sail. Chris could teach Robin climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht.

They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat. Chris and Robin paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was hard, but Robin was very steady. When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to climb down. Robin wanted to use his arms like on the boat, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Robin climbed down safely.

During this trip, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they go to Greenland together. Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone for their opinions before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring and hard. He liked being on land more than being at sea. Robin loved sailing and fixing things on the boat.

When they reached Greenland, Chris had to lead the climbing. He was worried about Robin's safety. Climbing the highest mountain in Greenland, called the Cathedral, was very hard. They climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were very tired. Robin trusted Chris and followed him. When it was too hard, they turned back. Robin was also worried about their boat.

On the way home, there was a small problem. They took turns watching the boat. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am, but Robin did not wake him. Robin thought he could do it alone. Chris felt Robin did not trust him, and he told Robin. Robin quickly said that Chris was wrong to think that.

They enjoyed their trip to Skye, but they really got to know each other during the Greenland trip. Chris found out that Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A Simple History of Apples**

Apples have been around for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of the old types of apples.

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. Long ago, people found apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. They even stored apple halves for winter. These apples were small and wild, very different from the apples we eat today.

**Learning About Apples (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. Some apples, like the dessert apple called Decio, came from the Romans. But many Roman apples did not grow well in Britain. British monks started to grow new types of apples.

**Popular Apples in the Middle Ages (1200)**  
In the 1200s, many apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a favorite dessert apple. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. But bad times came with droughts and the Black Death, so fewer apples were grown. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn more about apples. This man brought back many new apple types.

**Apples in New Lands (1750)**  
By the 1600s, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. A man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees in North America.

**New Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new type of apple from a dead tree. He named it 'Hawkey.' At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and said it was 'Delicious!' This apple became very popular. 

**Granny Smith Apple (1850)**  
In Australia, Maria Anne Smith found a small apple tree in 1868. She took care of it and grew green apples. People called her 'Granny Smith.' She believed that good things can come from what we think is trash.

**Today’s Apples (1950)**  
Now, apples are grown all over the world. But most apples come from just a few types. Many of these apples look good but do not taste very good. Some old apple types are still grown by gardeners in the UK, but many have disappeared in the US. People want more types of apples. We should care about keeping different kinds of apples for everyone."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners. He visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is in the mountains, ten miles south of the equator. The camp is near Mount Kenya, which is the highest mountain in Kenya. For three years, Richard has trained in this beautiful but quiet place called Nanyuk.

On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard decided to train with Kenyan runners. He ran in his first race in Kenya. He also stayed at the national team training camp. This is where the best Kenyan runners prepare for big competitions. Richard was invited to the camp after he finished fifth in a big race. He was happy to have this chance.

Training in the mountains helps runners because it makes their bodies better at using oxygen. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. Richard's first race in Africa was special because it was the first international cross-country race in Africa. Many Kenyan runners finished ahead of him, but he felt good about his race.

Kenyan runners are known for their simple way of training. They run easily and enjoy competing. Richard learned how they train at the camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, high up on Mount Kenya. The runners live with other students in simple rooms. 

Every day, they have three training sessions. They start with an easy morning run, then do hard training in the middle of the day, and finish with another run in the afternoon. They run about 40 kilometres each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometres.

Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with a dish called ugali, stew, and vegetables. After running, they go to a stream to wash.

By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just because of their genes or where they live. It is also about their simple life, hard work, and love for running. These things help them become the best in long-distance running."
CAE_7,"**Simplified Text:**

Advertising is not doing well. This problem started in 1989, before the economy got bad. Advertising is not keeping up with changes in the economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people, but now there are many different groups. Even big brands do not always target the right people.

Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Most of these items are not from brands you see in ads. You might only buy a few advertised brands. In a year, you probably buy about 400 different brands. But there are many more brands advertised, about 32,500. Most people only buy a small number of these brands.

When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. Most people find that only 1 in 16 ads is for something they will buy. This means that many ads are not useful. People do not buy most of the brands they see in ads.

Advertising can still work well. It needs to reach many people to find the few who will buy. Advertisers cannot know who will buy their products. Even when they try to target specific people, they cannot reach everyone. 

If an advertiser can get one million new customers, that is good. For many products, getting 2 percent of the population is a big success. To do better, advertising needs to focus more on the right people."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits a very green home in Britain. This home is in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Southwell has some surprises. The first is Southwell Minster, a little-known old cathedral. It has special carvings of 'green' men made by craftsmen long ago. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house', built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 

The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle waste into compost for their garden. They also heat their house with heat from their appliances and their own bodies, plus the heat from their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and is near the Minster. It was built to match the old buildings in the town and got permission to be built even in a protected area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet. The house is very well insulated, so you cannot hear anything inside. When you go inside and take off your shoes, it is very calm. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air. Robert opens special windows to let fresh air in. The house is designed to keep out drafts, even the cats have their own small door.

The Vales teach architecture at Nottingham University. They cared about the environment long before it was popular. They wrote a book about green homes in the 1970s called The Autonomous House. They wanted to build a house that did not produce carbon dioxide. They also decided to not use mains water. They made special toilets and put rainwater tanks in the cellar. They use copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean, which they filter before using. Water from washing goes into the garden. The Vales do not use a dishwasher because they think strong detergents are not good for the environment.

Robert says, ""We want people to see that it is possible to build a house that is better for the environment, without living in the dark."" The house looks a little old-fashioned inside, with a tall hall that has a fireplace and stairs. The Vales do not pay water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, which is very low. Soon, they will add solar panels to make even more electricity. The house will use some electricity from the mains for cooking but will make extra electricity. One day, they hope to charge an electric car with it.

The only heat in the house comes from a small wood stove, which they only use when it is very cold. When Robert was asked if it is warm in winter, he said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature was 18C, which is lower than usual, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no drafts. He believes that people used to feel warm in colder homes because of their clothing. 

The house is simple and easy to maintain. Most materials were bought from local shops and built by local workers. This made the house cheap to build, the same price as low-cost rental homes. Many big building companies do not like this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The Camera and Fairies

Arthur Conan Doyle made the Sherlock Holmes stories. He thought he was a smart man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw pictures of fairies in a garden. He believed these pictures showed that fairies were real. He wrote an article and shared the pictures, saying fairies are wonderful.

In 1939, the two women who took the pictures said they were fake. They cut out fairy pictures from a book and put them in flowers. The pictures looked nice, but the trick was simple. This shows that a camera can lie. 

Today, we can change pictures with computers. People think photography was always real, but that is not true. From the start, cameras changed what we see.'"
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

For a long time, people have been interested in iron. Blacksmiths are the people who work with iron. In the past, blacksmiths were very important. They made weapons, armor, and tools for farming. They were as respected as doctors. 

In the 1700s, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. But by the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain. Factories did not need them anymore, and new buildings did not use their beautiful work.

In the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become popular again. People like decorative buildings and new designs. However, some of the new work looks old-fashioned. Many shops sell items that look like they are from the past.

There are events to help blacksmiths. One event is an exhibition of ironwork by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). It opened last week in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says this could be a new time for blacksmiths. 

Now, blacksmiths can use power tools. This makes it easier for them to work with metal. They can bend and shape iron more easily. About 250 pieces of ironwork are in the show, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most money will go to the blacksmiths, but some will help the Association.

Alan Dawson has made a big gate and a lamp. He says, ""I let the steel bend and flow when it is hot. It is like drawing with metal."" Many artists love working with iron. It is soft when hot but becomes hard when it cools down. 

Susan May, a jeweller, says, ""It is magical. It is soft when hot, but hard when cold."" Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard. It feels like it will last forever.""

Iron is a special metal. It makes people feel safe and happy. It will likely be used for decoration for many years, as long as we do not see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Stopped Smoking**

I thought my friends would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one person was very angry. She asked, ""What do you mean? If it was easy, why didn’t you stop before?"" I could not explain how I went from smoking a lot to not smoking at all in just a few hours. 

Two months and three weeks ago, I went to a stop-smoking class. I did not plan to stop smoking. I did not really want to stop. I felt pressure from people who do not like smoking, and I still feel that way. I was healthy and did not often get sick. 

That Thursday, I went to the class to write about it, not to stop smoking. I said, ""I will not try to stop. I am here to write."" I liked smoking. It made me happy. The teacher looked at me like she understood. 

In the class, we could smoke as much as we wanted. The room was full of smoke, and we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I did not want to. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. I began to think that maybe I could stop. 

It was not hard to stop. The feeling of wanting a cigarette went away after a minute or two. I felt this for only four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was easy. 

The hardest part for me was being at home on weekends. I realized that smoking helped me not feel bored. I do miss smoking a little, but not too much. Now, every time I eat out, wait for a plane, check into a hotel, or take a break at the theater, I remember that I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"**Text: Dorothy Hodgkin**

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British woman scientist. She won the Nobel Prize, which is a very important award. But many people in Britain do not know her name. 

For four years, I have asked my friends about Dorothy Hodgkin. I tell them I am writing a book about her. If they know who she is, they pass my test. 

Dorothy Hodgkin is special because she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. Many famous writers are well-known, but Dorothy is not. She died in 1994. She was a great scientist and studied crystals. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like better education for women and the growth of science around the world.

When I started my research, I wanted to read about other scientists. A friend told me about Linus Pauling, who was also a scientist and a friend of Dorothy. I went to a bookshop to find a book about him, but there were none. I was surprised because he was a very important chemist and won Nobel Prizes too.

Some scientists think that stories about scientists are boring. Peter Medawar, a famous scientist, said that the lives of scientists are not interesting to read. If scientists think this, then publishers and bookshops might think so too. 

People often see scientists as different from artists or writers. But scientists can have interesting lives too. Some scientists do not want to be in the media because they do not want to seem like they are showing off. This can make young people less interested in science.

Today, more scientists are seen in public. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on TV, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars. These activities help people see scientists as real people.

The way we write about scientists is changing. Before, books about scientists were often boring. They did not talk much about their personal lives. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show that scientists can have fun and interesting lives. 

Dorothy Hodgkin worked hard in science. She found out the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize in 1964. She also worked on insulin. She had three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life is important too. 

Dorothy loved science, and this was very important for her success. It is hard to explain this passion to readers. Many people do not know enough science to understand complex ideas. But learning science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. 

It is sad that many educated people do not know about great scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help because their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a well-drilling business. They use machines to drill wells, but Margaret only needs her stick to find water. They find water more than 90% of the time.

This skill is called dowsing. Some people think it is a special sense. There are many ideas about how it works. One idea is that everything vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers can feel these vibrations. Others say they can smell water.

Recently, many farmers have needed help because of dry weather. Margaret usually sees each customer only once because wells last a long time. Some customers have cottages or barns where they want water. Others are building golf courses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She must be careful to avoid waste in the water. The water she finds is clean, but she must be careful about minerals like iron. She also needs electricity to pump the water, so the well should be close to power sources.

To find water, Margaret first looks at a map. She uses a pendulum, which swings over areas with water. After that, she walks with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels something strange. She uses the stick to find the best spot to drill. 

Margaret holds the stick with both hands. If the stick rises, it means water is below. It is important to drill in the right place. If she and her husband do not agree on where to drill, they keep looking until they do.

Margaret's skill is not just a local tradition. Many people are interested in how she finds water. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special way of understanding her surroundings. This skill helps her family run their well-drilling business every year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever wanted to live someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something new! We helped four people do this. Here are their stories.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda is 23 years old and has two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. 

Amanda went to the restaurant and was surprised. It was dark, loud, and full of people. It was very different from her home. She had to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. It was hard! The drinks fell and spilled everywhere. Amanda felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said it was okay. 

When the restaurant opened, many customers came. Amanda was nervous about remembering their orders, but the computer helped her. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. She had to ask customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. 

At the end of her shift, Amanda was very tired. She was happy to go back to her children. She learned that being a waitress is not easy!

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy is 30 years old and swapped lives with Amanda. She was nervous about being a mother for a day. 

Cindy had to get Amanda's two daughters ready. After dropping one daughter at school and the other at nursery, she thought she would have some quiet time. But she had to clean the house and do laundry! 

When the girls came home, they played and made a mess. Cindy tried to relax, but it was hard. She was tired by the end of the day. She learned that taking care of children is very tiring, but she also had fun.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary is 42 years old and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a teacher. 

On the farm, Rosemary wakes up very early. At school, she felt nervous in front of many students. She helped with math and a nature project. The teachers had little time to eat. 

Rosemary enjoyed a reading lesson and a French lesson, but she was tired. Speaking in front of the class was hard for her. She decided that she prefers farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary is 30 years old and went to Rosemary's farm. She arrived early but found out that Rosemary had been working for hours. 

Hilary helped in the ice-cream shop and bottled milk. She had to check the sheep and help them if they fell. Milking the cows took a long time, and it was lonely work. 

Hilary missed being with children. She learned that farming is hard work and not as easy as it seems. 

**Conclusion**

These four people learned a lot by swapping lives for a day. They found out that every job has its challenges and rewards!"
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet is not just for Christmas. Many musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a special trumpet player from southern Sweden. He is 30 years old and is known all over the world. He plays old music and new music. When you see him, he looks young and happy, just like the sound of his trumpet. 

When he was eight years old, his father gave him a real trumpet for Christmas. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music. Hakan loved the trumpet and played it all the time. His mother found a trumpet teacher for him. The teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw that Hakan had talent. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher.

Hardenberger says that the trumpet is not a perfect instrument. Every trumpet has small problems. He learned to understand these problems and work with them. Even when he was a boy, people could hear his special sound. 

Unlike another famous trumpet player, John Wallace, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He looked up to a French trumpet player named Maurice Andre. Hakan's parents helped him practice and supported his dream to be a trumpet player.

At 15, Hakan needed to choose where to study. He could not go to America, so he went to Paris at 16 to learn from Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra is not as good as being a solo player. Hakan knew he played better than many other young players. 

When he was 17, he entered a competition in Paris. He only learned some pieces for the first round, but he did well and moved to the second round. In the final round, he faced a hard piece. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing. He realized that even if he thought he played badly, people still listened to him.

Hardenberger is honest about his music. He does not want to explain his special talent because he thinks it might go away. He believes that music can always touch people's hearts.'"

F. **Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then I get ready for work. I take a taxi and arrive at 8:45 am. I talk to reporters to find out what is happening in the area I cover. I help companies understand financial risks. I write reports and send them to my editor. I travel to Africa three times a year for work. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

A. What is a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires others and helps them change for the better. Being a leader is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about work, says that a leader makes things happen with the help of enthusiastic people. A good leader should speak clearly and confidently. They should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says that many people can be great leaders if they see their own talents and use them. We all have the ability to be leaders; we just need the right situation to grow. It is easy to see famous leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, but it can be harder to see leadership in our own jobs. However, being a good leader is very important for good management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they do it? The best boss motivated you and supported you. The worst boss made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first boss led well; the second boss managed badly.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within rules. Leaders create new ideas. Micheal Shea, who writes about leadership, says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a sad company into a happy one.

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you care about and use that energy to lead.
- Think of yourself as a leader. You have the power to lead.
- Sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different ways of leading. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking charge instead. See how this changes things.
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better.

F. Leadership does not just happen. You need to take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, and give praise. 
- Don’t think everyone will like your way of leading right away. Keep working on how you communicate. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas should be good.
- Be present and available to important people. 
- Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent movies.**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense movie about oil workers and navy experts. They try to save a nuclear submarine that is stuck deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team are brave and funny. The special effects in the movie are very good, but the story is not very strong.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on a book about a battle in Guadalcanal. Director Andrew Marton made a more traditional war movie. He focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Another version of this story by Terrence Malick is more artistic, but Marton's film has some good moments, like when the soldier dreams of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
This fun movie is based on a book from 1875. It has a bad guy played by Fabrice Luchini, who causes trouble. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, and Daniel Auteuil plays a swordsman. The movie is full of action and humor, making it enjoyable to watch.

**D. Character**  
This movie is set in Rotterdam a long time ago. The costumes and sets look very real, like a museum. Jan Decleir plays a cruel bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is mean to his tenants. The story is about his bad relationship with his son, but the movie focuses too much on the details instead of the story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This movie has been remastered and looks great. The sound is very clear, and you can hear every little noise. The story is about three men: the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach). They all do bad things in the Wild West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This is a long war movie with many famous actors. It has four directors and thousands of extras. The beginning is slow, as soldiers wait for news about an invasion. The movie is impressive, but it is better to watch on a big screen than on video."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is a very interesting story. The main character is a lawyer. He has to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife because she is accused of killing her husband. The trial is exciting, and we do not know what will happen until the end. There is a big surprise at the end of the book. This is a great first book.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, helps rich people in Italy during the Renaissance. He gets into a lot of trouble with politics and murder, but we know he will find the bad people. The story is a bit complicated and too long, but it is still very good.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. The main character, Leah Hunter, is a tax inspector. She starts to investigate when a strange man dies near her. Leah is brave and smart, and she does not let anyone stop her, even the local detective who does not like her.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker is about a private investigator named Spenser. He helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The story has fast dialogue and some deep thoughts, but there are not many deaths. It is always good entertainment from Parker.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has two detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate a robbery at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's easy writing and interesting characters make this a fun mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife, Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It is about a lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim in the story. It has romance, money, and violence, making it a very exciting book.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a victim. Many funny characters come together to make a Robin Hood movie, but Philip does not like how his career is going. Simon Shaw usually entertains us, but this time the story is not as good as his other works.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is the best book by Lawrence Gough in a long time. Canadian police are looking for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it better than most detective novels."
CAE_57,"I might be too old for this, but here I go! Tim Pozzi is 34 years old. He left his good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age want to travel. This summer, he quit his job and decided to rent his flat. He wants to travel in South East Asia for a year. Some people think he is lucky, but he feels nervous. He has traveled before. After university, he backpacked in North and South America for two years. When he came back, he wanted to travel again. But then he fell in love, got a job, and bought a flat. He realized he was not happy just working for money. When he quit his job, he felt free again. 

Many of his friends are now married and have children. They do not want to change places with him, but they wish they had his freedom. Tim is not in a relationship and does not have big career goals. He feels he should enjoy his freedom for his friends. But he is still nervous. He has to make plans. He worries about someone else living in his home. He also needs to decide where to go. He is a big procrastinator and is already behind on his plans. He thinks, ""Maybe I should just enjoy summer in England."" 

Tim wonders if he can still backpack. Will he be okay living simply? Will he feel out of place with younger backpackers? Many people in their late twenties and thirties want to travel and leave their old lives. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says more people are realizing they can have adventures if they are brave and organized. 

Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says he is ready to give up job security for this trip. He knows he will come back to the same job position, but he thinks it is worth the risk. 

Matt, who just left the Army, says traveling helped him change. He needed to learn to live differently. There are many reasons people travel at this age. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says more people have flexible jobs. If a job ends, they have nothing to lose. Some companies even allow career breaks. 

Dan Hiscocks, from a travel publishing company, says many people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. If they are not happy, they know they can change. Travel helps them think about what they want. 

Jennifer Cox believes this is not a sign of not wanting to grow up. It shows that people want a balanced life. Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is going to Central America for a year. He does not think he is running away. He wants to find things for himself. But he feels nervous about leaving his comfortable life. 

I also feel nervous about leaving my easy life. I might not be going if I had not found my boss so hard to work with. Jennifer Cox says this is common. Sometimes a big change, like a breakup or losing a job, pushes people to travel. 

I am excited about the next year. No matter what happens, I will be happy that I took this chance. I think many older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist. She felt lost because of new technology. Here, she tells how she changed her home into a good place to work.

Last Christmas, I turned 37 years old. I realized I needed to get back to my job in journalism. I looked at my resume and saw that I was stuck in the past. I used to type on a typewriter, and now computers were everywhere. I thought no one would want me in a newsroom because I did not know how to use a computer. Many job ads asked for skills in desktop publishing, but I had none. I felt scared to use a computer.

I thought it would be hard to leave home to work. But then, I entered a contest in a local newspaper. My family and I won a computer! We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for everyone. We started to learn about the Internet and how to chat with people from around the world. The kids stopped watching TV, and I made a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take the kids to school.

The children were good with computers because they learned at school. I was nervous and thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I learned the basic skills I needed. It was easier than I thought. I started to write articles for a magazine, and now I feel happy because I can work and be with my family.

The computer helped me a lot. Before, my desk was messy, and I lost important papers. Now, I am more organized. I can keep track of money and use templates for letters and invoices. With the Internet, I can find information for my stories and talk to other journalists from around the world.

But working from home has some problems. I can feel lonely because I don’t see people often. There are also distractions at home, like chores and the kids wanting to use the computer. Many people in my neighborhood are also using computers for work, so we don’t have to travel to the city every day.

A report says that many people who work from home are educated and own personal computers. I feel like I am doing well. One day, I might even send my articles to a newspaper in another country or start my own magazine. The possibilities are endless!"
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has modern buildings that look like cheese wedges. The outside of the museum is very big and bright with a yellow tower. Many people have different opinions about the building. Some think it is beautiful, while others do not like it.

Inside the museum, there are many interesting things to see. The museum tells stories about Scotland's history. It has important objects, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. The museum wants to show the truth about the past.

Dr. David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He wants everyone to enjoy their visit, even if they do not know much about history. He does not want to use fake scenes from the past. He believes that people should see real objects and learn from them.

The museum has many spaces to explore. There are different galleries with pale walls and big windows that let in light. You can take your time to look at everything.

There is also a special area for children called the Discovery Centre. A group of kids helped create this space. They wanted to have fun and learn at the same time.

On the top floor, there is a gallery that changes every three years. It shows objects that are important to Scotland in the 20th century. People chose things like electric guitars and toys to show what mattered to them.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that real objects help us understand the past better than anything else. The museum is beautiful inside, but some people wonder if it is in the right place."
CAE_54,"**Simplified Text:**

The end of print newspapers may take a long time. ""Transition"" is a nice word. It means moving from one place to another. Some people are scared of change, but it can also be good. 

Now, newspapers are trying to move to the internet. This is not easy. Many people think print newspapers will disappear, but this is not certain. Print newspaper sales are going down, but more people are visiting their websites. For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.

However, not everything is clear. A survey showed that worldwide newspaper sales went up by 1.1% last year. In some places, like Asia, sales increased a lot. Some magazines also did well, with a 5.4% increase in sales.

E-books are becoming very popular, and many people are buying them. But when bookstores looked at their sales of physical books, they found that sales only went down by 0.4%. This means people are buying both e-books and paper books.

Many young people still read newspapers. According to a survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main newspapers in the UK. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, newspaper sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop was only 7%. In France, it was just 3.1%.

In the past, people thought that online ads would help newspapers make money. But now, online ads are going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to get readers is to offer both a print copy and online access together. 

Print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. They make much more money from print ads than from online ads. However, it is hard for newspapers to keep both print and online versions. They need to work hard to be noticed on the internet."
CAE_32,"**Taking Pictures of People**

People are very interesting to photograph. A picture with a person is usually better than one without. But taking good pictures of people can be hard. You need to think about how they move, their faces, and what they do. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking pictures of a group, do not have them stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and heights. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all their faces.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting they put their hands in their pockets or fold them. 

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when you are. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel shy. You may need to help them feel comfortable.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture looks better if the person is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They do not have to smile. If they look away, remind them to look back at the camera before you take the picture.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the picture. This can make the picture feel more natural. 

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
The way a person looks and moves tells us a lot about them. A happy child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for different expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up.

**G. Situation Interest**  
The background of a picture can add more meaning. Make sure the background does not take attention away from the person. 

**H. Interaction**  
Good pictures can happen when people are talking, laughing, or working together. Look for moments when people connect, like a handshake or a smile.

**I. People and Places**  
Many pictures of people are taken on trips. To show both the people and the place, step back to get everything in the picture. Make sure the people are close enough to see, but the background is also clear.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Think about why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose nicely. But for family pictures, candid shots of fun moments are often better than stiff poses. These pictures will help you remember the good times later."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist. She makes special paintings called trompe-l'oeil. These paintings look real, but they are not. Joanna Watt interviews her.

Sarah does not like to sign her paintings. She thinks the painting is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble. She wants people to think her paintings paint themselves.

At first, Sarah does not want to be interviewed. She does not like to talk about herself. But after a while, she feels more comfortable, and the interview becomes fun and interesting.

Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied art for two years and learned a lot about drawing. She worked at a publishing house but did not like it. Then, she worked with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to make one trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it. She decided to work on her own.

Sarah says that you cannot learn trompe-l'oeil from a school. You learn by observing the world around you. She is always learning new things. She is honest about her mistakes. For example, she says, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete.""

Once, she had to paint a big ceiling at Lulworth Castle. She got confused with the measurements and thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" She often talks about herself in the third person, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""

Sarah's trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special. Many people want her to paint for them. She gets ideas from buildings. For example, she made a trompe-l'oeil dining room that looks like a beautiful Italian building. 

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must do two things: it must trick you and keep your attention. She believes it should also be personal for the client. She enjoys working with her clients and listening to their ideas. Many of her clients become her friends.

Sarah is thankful for her clients. She says, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, and that is why she is always busy. 

At the end of the interview, Sarah says again, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" She wants her work to be quiet and not loud. But her work is very special, and more people should know about it."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman talks about important skills for success at work.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or how much we know. We are also judged by how we manage ourselves and how we get along with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to see who will do very well at their job and who will not. These new rules are important for all jobs. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well on tests is not as important anymore. Now, it is more about social skills and personal qualities, like being friendly, understanding others, and being flexible. These skills are called emotional intelligence.

B. Today, many jobs do not offer security. People need to have skills that they can use in different jobs. Personal qualities are becoming very important at work. We have talked about these qualities for a long time, using different names like 'character' and 'soft skills'. Now, we call them emotional intelligence. This means being aware of our own feelings and the feelings of others. It helps us think and act better. Emotional intelligence includes knowing ourselves, controlling our feelings, being motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think it just means being nice, but sometimes it means being honest, even if it is hard. It is not about showing all our feelings, but about managing them so we can work well together.

C. More companies are realizing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard to use their knowledge. Many people have succeeded without strong emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s jobs, teamwork and understanding customers are very important. Emotional intelligence is essential for doing well in any job around the world.

D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people get better at managing their feelings and understanding others over time. This growth is called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and use these skills to help us in our jobs. This is important now when jobs are not always stable. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if we ignore it, other things may not work as well."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones make it easy to take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, some journalists use social media to find images of fast events. But some reporters use pictures from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if it is very important for the public. People still talk about whether this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people will take pictures or videos of news events. This means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people are paid for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is a type of medicine from China that is over 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is often used to help with pain. Many doctors in the West use it to help people feel better.

**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**

In traditional Chinese medicine, health means that the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. There is a special energy called Qi (pronounced ""chee"") that flows in the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to organs in the body. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel sick or weak.

When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check your pulse, look at your tongue, and ask about your health and habits. They use very thin needles to help the flow of Qi. Sometimes, they use heat from herbs or apply pressure to certain points.

**Acupuncture Points**

There are over 300 points on the meridians where acupuncturists can place needles. These points may not be close to where you feel pain. People often feel a gentle ache or tingling when the needle is used. This means the needle is working with the Qi.

**How Does Acupuncture Work?**

Doctors in the West believe acupuncture can help with pain, even if they do not follow traditional Chinese ideas. They think that acupuncture can block pain signals or release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.

**What Pain Can Acupuncture Help?**

Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It can help with back pain, headaches, arthritis, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain and pain from serious illnesses.

**Using Acupuncture in Modern Medicine**

Acupuncture has been used in China for a long time, but using it during surgery started in the 1950s. Now, it is used in many types of surgeries in China. Some people say it helps reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia.

**Is Acupuncture Always Effective?**

Studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helps with chronic pain. It may take several visits to feel better, but some people feel improvement after just a few sessions.

**A Different Way to Treat Pain**

Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They ask many questions to understand what might be causing the pain. They consider things like weather and how the pain feels. This is different from how many doctors in the West think about pain.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. If needed, they should refer you to a medical doctor for more help."

CAE_5,"**Simplified Text:**

The pen is stronger than the psychoanalyst. People are studying handwriting to learn about a person's character. In some countries, if you want a job, you may need to show your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. 

Handwriting analysis, called graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Some researchers say it can help find certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer. It can also show how a person feels. Many companies now use graphologists to look at the handwriting of job candidates. 

However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure if graphology is useful. Patricia Marne is a graphologist with over 20 years of experience. She thinks handwriting can show psychological traits and health issues. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if someone should study arts or sciences.""

Ms. Marne believes graphology can help find people who might commit crimes. She says criminals often have bad handwriting. This can show they have emotional problems. She can tell if someone is honest or not just by looking at their handwriting. 

Ms. Marne says that handwriting can show if someone is under stress or has mental health issues. Changes in handwriting over time can mean something serious is happening. 

She also says that handwriting can show other traits. For example, if letters are connected like threads, the person may be clever but not honest. Writing mostly in capital letters can mean someone is hiding their true self. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity. 

Ms. Marne believes it takes six years to learn how to analyze handwriting well. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She believes it can be more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can show a person's history without asking questions. 

However, some psychiatrists do not agree. They say handwriting is just a result of education and has no other meaning."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and good chairs are important for happy and healthy workers, says a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies work conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here is what they said.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no air conditioning. The windows open to the street. The workers are part of a small team and seem happy. They change the office temperature by opening doors or using electric heaters, like at home. This may help them feel comfortable.
  
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture does not match. Some chairs are old and broken, which is not good for sitting. But the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This variety helps them not feel tired or bored.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff like the different types of work and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office looks nice and fun.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air is good, and there is a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has good chairs and lighting. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The walls are plain and not very interesting.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls have some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most workers have been there for a long time and get along well. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information easily.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers around.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for working on computers. 

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff help each other and use technology well. There are many awards on display. The office is busy.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, and the temperature changes a lot. The space is messy, and there is a lot of dust.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is not good for a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not help workers sit properly.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is dirty, with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. Workers seemed stressed and not happy. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular in America. People chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. It is a food and has very few calories. 

Today, gum is made with special ingredients to keep the flavor and make it soft. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a type of gum from a tree in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used it to clean their teeth and make their breath smell nice. 

In America, colonists learned to chew gum from the Native Americans. They chewed a resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people sold this spruce gum in the eastern United States. 

Modern gum started in the late 1860s when people found chicle, a substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and better to chew. However, it is hard to grow sapodilla trees, so now most gum is made with synthetic materials. 

Today, there are few people who collect chicle. They have a hard life. They walk for miles in hot and dangerous places to get the sap. They must be careful of snakes and insects. They climb trees to collect the sap and take it to a camp where they boil it to make gum. 

Life at the camp is tough. They eat a simple diet and drink local alcohol. Even though their work is hard, these collectors worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported a lot of chicle, but now much less is collected. 

As gum sales have increased, companies use synthetic materials to make gum cheaper. Gum is also marketed in many ways. People say gum helps you relax and can reduce tooth decay. Chewing gum can help your mouth produce more saliva, which is good for your teeth. 

Companies are always looking for new flavors and textures for gum. Some flavors are natural, but many are artificial. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the most popular chewing gums."

CAE_47,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they are good. Christopher Middleton watched her work. At the Globe Hotel, things are not going well. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not see Sue and Christopher. Sue thinks this is very bad. 

The Globe Hotel has three red stars. This means it is one of the best hotels. But the hotel is not welcoming. The entrance is hard to find, and the door is not manned. Sue is not happy. 

When they check in, the receptionist says they have no record of the booking. There are 15 rooms, but many are empty. The room they get is not nice. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall. 

Sue has a reputation for being tough. She remembers when people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she did not wear black. The next morning, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. 

Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not showing guests to the bad room. Robin takes notes and looks worried. He has only worked at the hotel for five months. 

Sue also praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. The dinner is good, and the hotel keeps its two-rosette food rating. Robin asks how to get three rosettes. Sue says they should not serve bad desserts. 

Sue's job is to tell the truth about the hotel, even if it is hard. Sometimes, people complain about her. She has to write a report about what she finds. The hotel pays for her help. 

The good news for Robin is that Sue will not take away the red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems are fixed. Robin smiles, but he does not look happy."
CAE_48,"**Seven Summits: Climbing the Highest Mountains**

Doug Scott is a mountaineer. He climbed the highest mountain on each continent. This is called the Seven Summits. He tells us about his climbs.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his friend Dougal were climbing Mt. Everest. They were in a snow cave when Dougal talked about sleeping bags. Doug thought this was strange because they were alone. He started talking to his feet because they were cold. They were worried about how to survive. Doug felt calm because he trusted Dougal. He found a good way to climb and reached the top.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is a very hard mountain to climb. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal carried their things to the base of the mountain. They climbed a new route. They carried their food and equipment on their backs. They camped under a cliff. The weather was bad, and they were tired. Finally, they reached the top and felt happy.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul wanted to climb Mt. Kenya. They got a free ride to Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the jungle and needed water. They found a rock pool and were very happy. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the top.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife Sharu went to Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil. They decided to climb with him. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The wind was strong, but they reached the top and camped outside. They met other climbers who wanted to climb the Seven Summits too.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif needed money. He and his team left for the South Pole in November 1992. The sun was always shining. On December 7, they climbed to the top in a storm. It was very cold, but they were happy to reach the summit.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In summer 1994, Doug's team met in St Petersburg. They took a cable car up Elbrus. They walked to a refuge. After two days, they climbed to what they thought was the top. But there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then went down the mountain.

Style is important in our lives today. It is in our clothes, home decoration, and accessories. Jo Foley shares some fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham makes beautiful wedding dresses. He says, ""People should choose simple styles instead of stiff and frilly dresses."" He has been drawing wedding dresses since he was a boy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. You do not have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress. He also makes long evening dresses in new colors and fabrics. For those who like classic styles, he designs a navy-blue suit that many women wore in the 20th century. But his version looks very modern.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but did not study jewellery. She started designing rings when she could not find one she liked. In 1990, she became a designer. Many famous people want her jewellery. She uses large semi-precious stones in gold to make beautiful necklaces, bracelets, and rings. Recently, she started using diamonds. She says, ""I wanted a diamond, so I began to work with them.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Lily Grimson started her handbag business four years ago. She only took a short art course. Two of her bags were chosen for a big design show. All her bags are handmade in the UK. A Grimson handbag is not just a bag; it is stylish and made from high-quality materials like calfskin and silk. 

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
Peter Little has been a hairdresser for over 20 years. Many famous people have had their hair done by him. He says, ""Most women want hair that looks real and is easy to style at home."" He wants his clients to look natural, not like they just came from a salon. His first appointment costs £250, and there is a long waiting list. He also sells his own hairdryers and styling tools for people to use at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and helps supermarkets and restaurants with flower ideas. She has no formal training in flowers and used to be a teacher. She started her flower business 10 years ago. Her modern flower arrangements have won many awards. She also teaches at her own London Flower School and has given lectures in Japan and the USA.

FCE_19,"Text: 'The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both guests and staff. 

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests' names. He uses a computer system to remember what guests like. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost a lot of money to set up, but it will help the hotel save money in the future. 

For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, the hotel will have that music ready for them when they come back. 

Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can set it between 14°C and 25°C. 

The hotel also has special technology for business guests. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for new technology and can change things easily. 

The rooms are comfortable and welcoming. There are 145 bedrooms, a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. 

The food is very good. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has made a new kitchen that is modern. 

With great food, good technology, and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful.'"
FCE_24,"**Artist Susan Shepherd and Her Garden**

Susan Shepherd is an artist. She is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is very big and has many flowers. She loves tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. 

There are two long flower beds along a path in the garden. The colors and shapes of the flowers are very nice. The people who owned the garden before Susan took care of it well. They left many plants that Susan likes. Susan also has a gardener named Danny. She says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She does not paint the whole garden at once. She takes a flower to her studio and paints it. This can take a few days. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. 

Spring and early summer are her busy times. This is when the tulips and poppies bloom. Susan loves how flowers change. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they may seem boring, but they become interesting.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She liked wild flowers that grew in hard places, like rocks.

Now, her garden has many plants from different countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely. 

Susan is busy preparing for two art shows. She has a lot of flowers to paint, but she also wants to work in her garden. She has hired another gardener to help her. She knows that to paint flowers well, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"**Title: The Storm and the Tree**

In March, strong storms hit the Brackham area. Many trees fell down, including two big lime trees in the town square. This made some people in the town unhappy because it changed how the town looked.

Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, was also unhappy. But during the storm, he was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and felt tight in his chest. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he did not want to go. He thought the police needed him. 

Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. The doctor gave him medicine, and Molly sent him to bed. 

On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the storm. Pelham was surprised. That evening, he asked if the house was okay. When he heard it was fine, he felt relieved and went back to bed.

On Saturday, Pelham felt better. He got up and saw that without the walnut tree, the living room looked very different. The room was bright, and the old furniture looked bad. The view from the window was not nice anymore. The tall house next door, which the tree had hidden, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said to Molly. But Molly was not sad. She said, “I told you we need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We lived in our valley for sixteen months. One day, we saw that the hills around us could be dangerous. It was a year when storms came early, before winter. Until then, we felt safe in our valley. 

Then, it started to snow. In one day, there was 15 centimeters of snow. The snow blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery. In the hills, the snow was deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we felt only some wind. The trees moved, but they did not break. 

We were not too worried about the snow and wind. But we were worried about the river, the Ryburn. It usually flowed gently, but now it was a problem. Many years ago, people built dams to control the water from the hills. 

Soon, the snow began to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds over the hills. The clouds looked scary and warned us of trouble. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The rain was coming down hard, and the reservoir in the hills was filling up. 

Then, the reservoir overflowed for the first time in years. Water rushed over the dam like a waterfall. The river became wild and deep near our cottage. For three days, we hoped the river would not flood our home. Luckily, the dam held, and the water went down. 

In the past, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam keeps the river safe. Most of the time, we do not worry. We can enjoy the big clouds in the sky and feel safe in our valley home."
FCE_21,"Mark Adams is a film critic. He has worked for a newspaper called The Front Page for ten years. Writing about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before this, he wrote reviews for books and films for other newspapers and magazines. He also did some work for the radio. 

He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom hired him. Tom was not a journalist, so he did not choose his staff carefully. He wanted a team of critics to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have lunch together each week to talk about what to cover. It felt like a dream for Mark to be part of a new newspaper. He thought it was strange that a new paper could start when there were so many others. 

The first time Mark saw someone reading his review in the newspaper, he felt shy. Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, so they talked by phone instead. People liked to have one reviewer for each subject, so Mark chose to write about films. 

Now, he writes a long piece each week about one film. He likes this way of working. He does not want to be a standard film critic who reviews every new film. That would make him tired of his job. He enjoys having space to write his thoughts. 

Mark thinks people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. People usually stick to what they like. A person who does not like westerns is not likely to watch one just because of a review. Mark does not feel he must be right about a movie. He does not think there should be a set number of good or bad films each year. He just wants to share his opinion. He does not want to be a judge."
FCE_46,"**Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because it is fun!**

Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves sports. She is looking for a training partner who also likes to swim, cycle, and run. She wants someone who can do all three sports without stopping. 

Triathlons are very popular in the Olympics. In a triathlon, athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without a break. Many people watch these events. But why do athletes like Melanie push themselves so hard? 

Melanie started doing triathlons when she was 14 years old. She won her first race, but she was the only junior girl there. She felt confident and entered a bigger race. She swam fast and ran fast, but she got lost and cycled too far. She cried while running, but she did not give up. 

Melanie works very hard. She trains a lot, even when it is hard. Steve Trew, a coach, says she gives everything in her training. She is very strong and finished 13th in the European Triathlon Championships this year. 

Melanie wants to buy a new bike for her races. It costs a lot of money, and her parents help her pay for it. She trains a lot and does not have much time for friends. After swimming for two hours, she just wants to sleep. But she still talks to her teammates about their training times.

Melanie has tried shorter races, but she wants to do even harder ones. She says it is hard to find friends her age to train with."
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about collecting things and why many people like this hobby. Many adults enjoy collecting. It is a fun and exciting world. But if you want to collect something, remember: you should love the item. 

People have always liked to collect. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.

I have collected many things in my life, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. When I was six years old, I started collecting stones from my parents' garden. I went to a school in a cold place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a museum. The museum had many interesting objects collected by people long ago. I loved looking at them.

Many adults also enjoy collecting. Some people collect because it is something they can control. For me, I just like it. 

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful things. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had over 4,000 paintings. But you do not need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I got a special tulip from another collector. I planted it, but one year it disappeared. Someone took it!

I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I looked everywhere in the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was lost in a fire. The next day, I saw the burned remains of my dolls and furniture. I was very sad.

I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king is very valuable. As more people want small items, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you kept the original boxes. I wish I had kept mine!"

I put together exhibitions. I plan and design them. I also tell people about the exhibition. I read about the topic and talk to important people to find out what to show. I make sure visitors can understand the exhibition. I plan fun activities like displays and workshops. I work with engineers to keep everything safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help make brochures to tell people about it.

**Janet - Teacher for London Taxi Drivers**  
I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. I make new maps for taxi drivers to learn their routes. By noon, about 50 students are in class. They learn the best ways to drive around London. If they disagree about a turn, I help them decide. When they are close to their test, I give them a route but change it to make them think of another way. 

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the sea and work from home. I answer phone calls, make educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but I mostly work by the coast. I work with schools and teach people about the sea. I take them on a boat to show them the life under the water. This helps them understand better. I love my job because I care about conservation, but I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is different every day. I make sure we have enough books and that they are good quality. We get letters from readers about maps, and I answer them carefully. I talk with my team about new projects and sales. I enjoy working with my team, but I have a lot of paperwork to do, which takes time away from fun tasks like designing new products."

We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made it bigger, but they did it nicely.

Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still looking for guests. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible.

The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were friends in school, so we call Strafe by his last name like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. It is a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she is usually waiting in the big hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She named our rooms after flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little things like that. Her husband takes care of repairs.

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good.

Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur took us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and coming back for the rest.

After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we did not play long because we were still tired from the trip. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the path to the sea.

In the morning, we would walk on the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because we had done the same things for many years. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She works in Val d'Isere, France. Sarah is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She studied French and History of Art at university. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a long-term job, but it is fun. She meets many interesting people.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. The guests eat porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and sometimes makes afternoon tea for the guests. She does not like cleaning the rooms because it is hard work.

By 11 a.m., Sarah goes skiing. She loves to ski and can stay on the slopes until 4:30 p.m. After skiing, she returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans the kitchen. She does not like a messy kitchen in the morning.

Sometimes Sarah talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. Good guests make her week better. Sarah meets her friends in the chalet, and they go out at night. They usually go to places like Bananas and G Jay's.

On Sundays, Sarah works very hard. She wakes up early to make breakfast for guests who are leaving. After they go, she cleans the chalet quickly. If she has not done the shopping, she does it now. At about 3 p.m., she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive at 4:30 p.m. 

Sometimes the new guests have many questions. Sarah helps them get boots or skis from the ski shop. After that, she gets ready for dinner again. Sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with light skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore big shoes and overalls, and her hair was messy but framed her pretty face. Seymour was surprised that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research about leather in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

A few times a year, people called or wrote to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he helped students by answering their questions or giving them a short tour. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class who visited the factory years ago. Seymour showed them how he made gloves, especially Marie's favorite part, the laying-off table. At this table, the workers shaped and pressed each glove using hot brass hands. Marie thought these hands looked strange and called them ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked Seymour, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come to your shipping department?"" Seymour explained, ""They come to the tannery. The tannery makes the leather for us. My grandfather and father worked there, and I did too for six months. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour said, ""You should go if you want to write about leather. I can help you visit one. It’s an old place, and the work is hard. Tanning is one of the oldest jobs in the world. They found tanning tools that are six thousand years old in Turkey. The first clothes were just animal skins that were smoked to make them soft.""

Seymour continued, ""My father knows a lot about leather. If you talk to him about gloves, he can talk for two days! Glovemen love their work. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" Rita replied, ""Not really. I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" Seymour laughed. He liked her spirit and eagerness to learn. 

Rita was much smaller than Marie, but she reminded him of her. Marie was always happy and full of what she learned in school. She wrote everything down and remembered it well. Seymour said, ""Let's do something fun. We will show you how to make gloves from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down!"" He jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust. He laughed and shouted, ""I dare you all! You're all cowards!"" His friends looked scared but then one by one, they jumped down too. They all laughed and lay on the sawdust, telling jokes.

After a while, one friend said, ""Let’s go up to the roof again and jump down."" They were not very excited, but they went up. They jumped off, but Michael stayed on the roof. His friends called, ""Come on, Mike! What’s wrong?"" 

Michael wanted to jump, but he felt scared. He looked down at the ground and thought about jumping. His friends laughed at him because he was taking too long. They started to walk away, still shouting at him. 

Michael felt sad and alone. He stayed on the roof for a long time, watching the sun go down. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a while, and the yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 

When he got up, he felt ashamed and walked home slowly. He was late for dinner. His stepmother said, ""You should be home on time. If not, you can stay out tonight."" She looked serious, but Michael didn’t really hear her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change but don’t know how? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people who want a new job go to a careers adviser. 

First, you write a short history about yourself. Then, you take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a report with suggestions for jobs and any training you might need.

I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. Taking the test felt like being in a science exam. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I had to remember that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard. They included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. 

After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was sad to learn I did not do well in the science and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse! But it was good to hear I made the right choice in journalism.

Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. She said, ""Losing my job was a chance to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. ""I did not know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of training in design,"" she said. 

Donna also got other ideas, like taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she used her skills and found a job as a Public Relations officer. She said, ""I think I would have found this job without Career Analysts, but they helped me see what I really wanted to do. I have sent six friends there, and they are all happy.""

Some people feel they really needed help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services after working at a bank for six years. She said, ""My job was boring, and I wanted a new challenge. I did not know what to do, so I went to the adviser with an open mind."" 

She took the tests, which showed she liked sciences. She had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided to study geology. She said, ""The advice was worth the money. I am much happier now.""

But not everyone finds careers advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, 24, was a sales representative. She said, ""I did not know where to go in my career. I thought a careers adviser might help me. I got many new ideas, but I did not like them because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of training. I did not learn anything new about myself. If I told a friend my story, they would give me the same advice."""
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a nice blue couch. Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Many people only go to the dentist when they are in pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make the office a place where people feel safe. He does not wear a white coat because many people think white coats mean pain. He believes dental visits should be relaxing and fun.

Jerome uses new ideas to help people relax. One idea is virtual-reality headsets. His office was the first in Britain to use them, and many patients like them. When a patient sits on the blue couch, they can watch a movie about underwater animals while he checks their teeth. The headset also shows a special camera that lets the patient see inside their mouth.

The office smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today it smells like oranges. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. The usual dentist smell can make people scared. I thought the nice smell in the office was very good.

Jerome is known as a stylish dentist, but he takes his work seriously. The ways to help people relax are important, but good treatment is the most important. He uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a little strange, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental care. He found that when you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for the dentist too. He wants to change the way dentists work in Britain to make it less formal.

When a patient arrives, Jerome quickly goes to help. He offers them tea, asks what video they want to watch, and gently leads them to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a nice beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,"**Chocolate: A Sweet Story**

Chocolate comes from South America. Now, it is a big business all over the world. In Britain, people spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter. They buy more chocolate at Easter than at any other time, except Christmas.

A long time ago, the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans grew cacao plants in Central America. The cacao tree is a tropical plant. It grows in places like Africa and South America. The tree has big fruit that has 20 to 40 seeds inside. When the seeds are dried, they are called cacao beans. In English, they are often called cocoa beans. 

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water."" This drink was special and used for ceremonies. The Spanish liked to add sugar and cinnamon to the drink. It took a long time for this drink to become popular in Europe.

In the late 1600s, people in Europe started to drink chocolate in special places called chocolate houses. For many years, people made chocolate drinks from solid chocolate. In 1826, a man named CJ van Houten made chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate drinks.

In 1847, a company in Bristol made the first chocolate bar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate. At first, French companies sold most of the chocolate in Britain. But then, Cadbury made a famous chocolate bar called Dairy Milk in 1905. This bar became very popular.

Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies are always trying to find new ways to sell chocolate. They make chocolate bars into ice cream or desserts to attract more customers.

However, cacao farmers have had a hard time. In the late 1980s, the price of cocoa beans fell a lot. Many small farmers could not keep their farms. So, when you eat chocolate, remember the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke is 83 years old. He is very good at making art. He wants to try new things, like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he is happy making beautiful things from shells. 

Peter shows me his work in his home. He asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring. He is interesting and his art is beautiful. He shows me some shell decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I don’t mind if people don’t buy them. I love them."" He never planned to sell his art. Five years ago, some friends told him to have an exhibition. They wanted people to see his work. They talked to a gallery owner. 

His first exhibition was in London, and 70% of his art was sold. His second exhibition just opened. The prices for his art are high. Some pieces cost around £2,000. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a vase. Peter says he does not set the prices. He believes his work is special. 

Peter wishes he had started making art earlier. He thinks he could have made even better things. Now, he feels he cannot work as much because he is older. But his work is very different from the common shell art you see in shops. He makes boxes with many tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of beautiful flowers. 

Peter has his own way of working. He uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from shirts for his flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His work looks very nice and not random.

Peter travels to find beautiful shells. He has been to many places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He looks for shells on the beach. He only collects dead shells. He does not take shells with living creatures. He says, ""I see many people breaking shells. I collect the ones that are left."" 

Peter’s art is beautiful, and he believes it is okay to collect shells that are not alive."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is 15 years old. She is a model. When she is not working, she studies for her school exams. 

One day, a reporter named Jane Laidlaw is waiting to meet Kira. The receptionist says Kira will be late. Jane worries. She thinks about bad things she has heard about models. She wonders if Kira will come at all. 

But when Kira arrives, she is smiling and friendly. She is tall and pretty, wearing a simple black dress and trainers. Kira has to bring her mother with her because she is under 16. Kira's mother is proud of her daughter.

Kira did not plan to be a model. Her older sister told her to join a model competition. Kira said no, but her sister sent in some photos. When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. She felt happy and confident. Kira won the competition and got a job offer from a model agency in London.

Now, Kira has two lives: school and modeling. Her friends and teachers are proud of her. But some people at school say mean things. They think Kira is too proud. Kira says she is still the same person, but she feels more confident now.

Being a model is busy. The agency can call her anytime for a job. Kira cannot always make plans with her friends because she does not know her schedule. But her friends understand and support her.

Kira has a bright future as a model. She is successful even before finishing school. When Jane asks Kira what she would do if she were not a model, Kira says, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Search for Gold**

Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son from Canada. They are looking for gold in Africa and Wales. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain has a lot of gold, maybe 10,000 ounces. After ten years of digging, they believe they are very close to finding gold worth five million dollars.

Terence, who is 68 years old, said, ""We are finding a lot of gold. We just need to dig a little more."" They have worked hard to find gold. They started their search after Terence read about gold in a place called the Dolgellau gold belt in Wales. 

They read old mining books and chose a good place to dig. They cleared the land, found some gold in the rocks, and spent ten years getting permission to work. They took samples of the earth and removed old cars and trash. They dug out a lot of rock to make a tunnel.

Now, they need more money. They spent their savings and need £50,000 to dig deeper for the gold. Chris said it is hard to find a backer for the money. 

People in the area are interested in their search. Peter Woolven, who manages a hotel, said, ""If they find gold, it could bring more tourists here."" But he hopes many people do not come to dig in the hills.

The gold industry in Wales is not as strong as it was in the late 1800s when many people worked in mines. One mine that made wedding rings for the Queen closed last month. Now, more people are looking for gold again. George Hall, another gold seeker, wants to dig a tunnel on a nearby hill. He said, ""Searching for gold is exciting. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.

When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is like a small car. It takes her three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots who drive the vehicle. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside.

A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rocks and water, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem, Rachel can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.

The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. She was on a ship with an instructor. He told her what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot got sick. They wanted to see how she would feel in a small space.

Now Rachel has dived six times. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The volcanoes blow out black smoke. The Russian team was leaving equipment to study a project that would make a hole in a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. They release water that looks like black smoke. This water comes out very fast and is very hot.

Rachel was scared the first time she dived with an American team. They were using equipment when there was a loud explosion. She thought she might die. They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was amazing!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the window, she sees the volcanoes. She feels wonder because no one else has seen them before. She studied black smokers for three years. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little tan. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. I was very tired. I could not understand any more train times, money, or languages. I said, ""Never again,"" when I got home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. 

I just had to buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. It rocks you to sleep. Carrying my things in a backpack made me travel simply. I learned to throw away things I did not need, like old socks and books. 

This way of traveling is part of Inter-Rail. You can forget about rules and just enjoy. All you need is a ticket. This ticket lets young people travel to many countries in one day. 

On my first trip, my friends and I did not know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to see more countries. The extra travel did not cost us anything. 

We were not only interested in culture. This was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans and only saw the sights that were easy to find. We wanted to do something different. I was proud that sometimes I only looked at the view from the train station. 

We just wanted to enjoy our time. We shared the train floor, food, water, money, and music with other travelers. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place you only heard about before. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. 

You can only understand Europe by seeing it. You see different places and lifestyles. Everyone knows about Europe, but it is not real until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. The train trip may not show you new things in the world, but it is a special experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see this, even if it takes time."
FCE_37,"Text: 

It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your bags are not there. You may have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you may be in a very different place and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather.

Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes. It is hard for any airline to promise that your checked bags will go on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for bags to be checked and put on the plane. There is also a minimum time needed to change flights. This time is often longer to help with bag transfers. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause delays. This can lead to lost bags.

Human mistakes can also happen, like if a bag label gets torn off. Big airports, called 'hubs', can have more problems because they handle many bags. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, and many were changing planes. British Airways had two million passengers changing planes there.

Even good airports like Amsterdam and Singapore can have bad days. Some airports, like Miami in the United States, are known for losing bags when passengers change planes quickly.

To avoid losing your bags, try to book direct flights. Check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline. Take an earlier flight to give yourself more time to change planes. Make sure to label your bags with your name and address inside and outside. Include your flight numbers too.

If your bags are still missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a report before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Charlie James is a wildlife photographer. He knows a lot about the kingfisher. The kingfisher is a small bird that is blue and green. It lives near rivers and streams and eats fish. 

Old trees grow near the water. The trees make some shade on the shallow water. The colors around are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sun. The kingfisher moves quickly and looks like a flash of light. It is very fast and can be hard to see. 

Charlie loved kingfishers when he was young. He does not know why he loves them so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. One story says a goddess turned into a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its body became blue like the sky. 

Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. They look blue because of how their feathers are made. The light makes them look blue or green depending on the angle. 

Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. They are shy but can be watched from a hiding place. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket over his head. He waited near a place where kingfishers liked to go. The bird came back very quickly and sat close to him. 

Charlie spent a lot of time by a stream with kingfishers. But he missed school because he wanted to be with the birds. He did not do well in school. At 16, he started working for a nature magazine. Later, he became a freelance wildlife cameraman. 

Now, Charlie wants to make a special film about kingfishers. He wants to show beautiful images without talking. He loves to take pictures of the kingfisher's wings. 

Charlie has spent many years with kingfishers. He feels a strong connection to them, and his photos show some of his feelings. But he knows there is much more to his love for kingfishers than what his work can show."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She wanted to learn from a famous conductor named Claudio Abbado in Vienna. One day, she had to help because an assistant was not there. After that, she helped with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I was not nervous. I like standing in front of an orchestra,"" she said. Anne is from America and works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting good chances to work. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying two times before. He is happy it happened when it did. ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten,"" he said. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. But he worries about being known only for the competition. ""If in three years people still think of me as a competition winner, I will be worried,"" he said. But now, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra invite him back to work.

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She loves the long practice time for opera. ""The music needs four weeks of work,"" she said. She began conducting in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional two years ago. Learning from Sian Edwards was important for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from bigger people,"" she said. She enjoys the complex nature of opera with its many arguments and different singers.

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. He says conducting surprised him, but he finds it very interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed a show called Handel's Agrippina from the piano. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and tried my best,"" he said. He is thankful for all his experiences in music. Now, he is open to trying new things to find out what he enjoys.

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
Wayne Marshall is 32 years old. In 1986, a famous conductor named Simon Rattle noticed him and told his agent about Wayne. Soon, Wayne had to conduct a musical in London with little notice. It was a hard start. Some musicians were reading newspapers during the show. ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat,"" he said. He believes that many musicians do not need much advice from a conductor. ""I am not afraid to say what I want,"" he said. Wayne has not studied conducting in school, but he is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many in Britain. We asked five families to try some parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US. We thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, and they enjoyed it a lot. For older kids, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, we were tired, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having fun. The park could be more exciting, and the view was not great. But the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we did not know what to expect. We thought Oscar was too young, but he loved it! He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, where there are small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We spent six hours there and were happy there were places to rest. The park looked nice, and the staff were friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great show. We went on the Terror Line, and the girls were scared but said they liked it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small for it! The park is well designed, and even waiting for rides is not boring. It is very clean, and the staff are nice. One staff member helped me with one of the girls when I could not sit with both.

**The Great Park - The Langridge family**  
We got to the park at one o'clock and were sad it closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am scared of rides, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then becomes exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I did not want to go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun. If the children were older, they might think it was too easy, but they loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. The tallest roller-coaster in Europe, the Rocket, is very big. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters high, was worse! There are many rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. The staff were nice to younger kids, but some were not very friendly. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We could not tell the kids we were going home early!"
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside.

A. CHRISTINE HOGAN runs a computer design business. She says, ""My customers are friends."" She moved from London to the countryside with her husband when their children were small. She wanted to work from home. She had worked with computers before, so her husband suggested she start a computer design business. It was hard at first, and she needed a lot of money. She was careful with her spending and talked to the bank manager when she needed help. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evening if she wants. Her business is small, and people from the area come to pick up their work.

B. MAGGY SASANOW makes greeting cards from home. She says, ""I enjoy being independent."" She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no jobs in the countryside. So, she started her own business and makes 50 different greeting cards to sell to museums. She works in a big room upstairs. Sometimes, it is hard to work from home because there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She does not advertise; people hear about her work by word of mouth. She is cheaper than other artists. Working alone can be lonely, but she likes it more than not.

C. DELIA TURNER makes curtains. She says, ""It has been hard at times."" She started her business eight years ago. At first, it was good, and her income grew a lot. She had six workers, but she had to let them go when the economy got worse. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. She sometimes has to lower her prices and look for new opportunities.

D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because it was cheaper than London, and she loves the country. She likes to work when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at different times. It is hard to stay focused and shut the office door. She publishes children's books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because she had worked in London before.

E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake business and a shop. She started ten years ago at home. She is interested in health, so she makes fruit cakes with good ingredients. Friends and family asked her for cakes, and soon she was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building to make the cakes. Now, she has a baker and an assistant. She does not bake anymore; she manages the business. Her biggest problem has been money because she did not have a lot to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is very special. The sons are musicians and write music, and Dad makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins are teachers in South Wales. They have a ten-year-old son named Paul. Paul wanted a cello, but it was too expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He found a school where he could learn to make instruments. He took evening classes for three years.

After making some violins, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says it was very good. John made another cello for Paul, and he used it for many years. Now, John makes about twelve violins each year. He even sold one to a famous American musician.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul began with the piano. He loved to play it as soon as he could reach the keys. Later, he wanted to play the cello. His dad wanted him to play the violin, but Paul did not like it. He thought the cellist in his dad's group was very cool, so he took cello lessons.

Huw, now 22, also plays music. He is a pianist and composer. He says his parents were very supportive and did not push him too hard. 

Paul has done very well with the cello his dad made. He won a big music competition and became the main cellist for the BBC Symphony Orchestra when he was just 20 years old. Now, he plays a very old cello on loan from a music school. 

Paul will soon play on television, but he cannot watch it because he has a concert the same night. Huw also has a concert that night. Their parents, John and Hetty, will be very busy trying to see both of their sons perform."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside**

**The National Trust**

The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the countryside in Britain. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust.

Gareth says a National Trust Warden needs common sense. He also needs to be good with people because he talks to farmers, visitors, and builders all the time. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm. Many people wanted to be a warden, but Gareth got the job because he knows the area well and has farming experience.

Gareth still helps on his parents' farm. This helps him understand the farmers' problems. He can also do the hard work of the job, like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working for the Trust, he has learned more about nature. When he was young, he liked to pick flowers and collect butterflies. Now, he sees that farming has changed the countryside.

At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted different things. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth says they are close to working together.

Gareth's job includes helping people visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. He wants to finish jobs well and save money. He enjoys seeing projects done, but he also spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, even if he is always working. He likes talking to people, but some visitors can be rude. They come in, ask for everything, and leave without thanks. This can be frustrating for him. But Gareth believes that common sense is important.

If you have common sense and want to work outside, you might think about becoming a warden like Gareth. But remember, there may not be a job available in the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park.

I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She said, ""I am focused on my training. I don’t see much else. I might see cars slow down, but that’s it.""

Kendra said, ""My life is about being my best for the World Championships."" She has a strict schedule to be very fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championship, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries playing.

Kendra said, ""We will have support from home, which is special. It is important to make netball better in this country. There will be more pressure because people expect us to do well.""

Their first game is against Barbados right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We have always won against them, but they are good players.""

The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra said the Championships will be hard. ""You must play your best every day. There is no rest between games. You only have one chance to win.""

In the fifteen years she has played, netball has become harder and faster. Kendra said, ""You train to win. But after the game, we are friends.""

Netball is also using more science to test fitness. Kendra said, ""We must think and train like top players. As captain, I want to be strong and help my team.""

What can you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents do not see their child's talent until the child gets upset or acts out. Most regular schools help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special help. This help is not always available in regular schools, especially if music is not very important there.

Children who are very good at music can go to special music schools. There are five of these schools in Britain. They help children aged seven to eighteen learn music with professional musicians. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have lessons, practice in special rooms, and play in groups. They also study important subjects like English, math, and science, but less time is spent on these subjects compared to music.

The five music schools in Britain are independent. This means they are not part of the government school system. The classes are small, so teachers can pay more attention to each student. Most children live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be with other children who love music too.

However, there are some problems. The schools are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for children who live there. The schools try to help families with scholarships, which are financial aids. Also, not all parents want to send their young children to live at school. The directors of the schools worry about admitting very young children because it can be a lot of pressure. They want to help children grow up to be well-rounded people.

Sometimes, being in a special music school can be stressful. A child’s musical talent might change as they grow older. The pressure to succeed can make them feel like they are failing. The schools watch each child closely and offer help when needed. Many former students say they learned a lot from the music schools, but some wish they had more academic classes. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more in school.

It might be better to wait until a child is older to decide if they should go to a special music school. Children who are good at both music and school subjects can do well in regular schools with good music programs. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges. However, this option may not be available for families who live far from big cities."
FCE_25,"**Artist Susan Shepherd and Her Garden**

Susan Shepherd is an artist. She is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is very big and has many flowers. She loves tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. 

The garden has two long flower areas next to a path. This path goes from one side to the other. The people who lived there before Susan took care of the garden. They left many plants that Susan likes. Susan also has a gardener named Danny. She says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas. But when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She does not paint the whole garden at once. She takes a flower to her studio and paints it. This can take a few days. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. 

Spring and early summer are busy times for Susan. This is when the tulips and poppies bloom. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" She also likes to see how flowers change. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She thought wild flowers were special because they grow in hard places, like rocks.

Now, her garden has many plants from different countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely. 

Susan is busy preparing for two art shows. She has a lot of flowers to paint, but she also knows that to understand her flowers, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

Sarah studied French and History of Art at university. She says being a chalet girl is not a long-term job, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two. She meets many interesting people.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.

After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She thinks cleaning is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she skis until 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like to see a messy kitchen in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. 

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They visit different places to have fun. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.

On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for the guests is at 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., she is ready for the new guests. They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. Then it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she talks with friends, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

She went to a photo studio and then to meetings before lunch. The zoo is calm and quiet, but at the magazine, she was busy. Some people at the magazine looked stressed, but her job at the zoo is not stressful. In the afternoon, she laughed because she usually cleans animal cages. She likes how magazines work, but she loves her job at the zoo.

Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at the zoo. She wore leather boots and dark blue pants. The zoo gave her a green shirt to wear because she got very dirty. While she petted an elephant, she thought about Mandie working at the magazine. By five o'clock, she was dirty but happy. She said, ""When I stop working in fashion, I might work with elephants in Africa.""

Five famous people share their favorite memories of train journeys with Andrew Morgan.

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I love the south of France. I go there as often as I can. There is a train from Cannes that goes along the coast to Italy. The views are beautiful, no matter the weather. You can see nice houses and gardens. The people on the train are fun. There are tourists and locals, all enjoying the trip.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have taken many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to Kruger National Park because I was too young. When I moved to England, I saw my first big train station, London Waterloo. It was amazing!

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
One special train for me is the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon in France. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress. I loved it! Someone said pink is good for the brain, so I wear it a lot now. The journey was lovely, and we took a boat on the Nile after that.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
I worked on a project about traveling around the world. We had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not good, and we had to wait. When the train came, many people got on, even on the roof! At night, we saw beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Many people love trains from when they are kids, but I did not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where there were not many trains. I started to love trains as a teenager when I made a film in Yorkshire. We filmed on an old train line. I loved riding the train, and when I went back last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Do you want to get your story published? Margaret Stubbs can help you. Many readers ask, ""I wrote a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. To sell your writing, you must know about the market. 

One good way to learn is to read a lot. Go to your local library and visit bookshops. Reading helps you understand what publishers want. Remember, things change. New magazines and books come out all the time. 

If you want to write short love stories, find magazines that publish them. Get recent copies and see what kind of stories they like. Each magazine has different readers, and they want different things. 

Sometimes, new writers send their stories to me and ask, ""This was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I try to be honest but positive. Many new writers send their work too soon. If you only have one story, it is hard to get published. 

When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have worked in writing for a long time. When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories. Write ten or twenty more. Each story will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. 

Don’t throw your stories away; make them better. At first, don’t show your work to others. Remember, many successful writers were rejected many times before they succeeded. 

Do everything you can to improve as a writer. Look for a creative writing class near you. If you can’t find one, join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and feel more confident. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were many more people than I thought. The station did not feel nice and clean like before. Old couples with matching bags sat on the benches, and college kids had their bags all over the floor.

A man with grey hair was walking around. He looked rich. He had nice clothes. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. She said no, she was going to New York. Then he asked a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I wanted to talk to her too. The man asked her, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said she was going north, but not to Philadelphia.

Next, he asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going to Wilmington. He kept walking. I was curious about him. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me, but he didn’t. He looked at me quickly and then walked away.

He looked worried. He asked a woman reading a book, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said yes. He asked her for a favor. I stood a little away and looked at my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. The woman seemed nervous. The man said, ""It’s not too hard, I promise!""

They announced my train. People started moving to Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man told the woman, ""My daughter is flying out today from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning and went home. My wife was upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station and didn’t know what to do.""

The woman felt sorry for him. I thought he should be quiet and let her ask questions. He said, ""I told her to stay at the station. I will get someone to bring her passport.""

I thought, ""Why doesn’t he go himself?"" The woman asked him, ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" He said, ""I can’t leave my wife alone. She is in a wheelchair."" I thought this was a weak excuse. 

I looked at them. The man was holding a padded envelope, not a normal one. It was big like a book. I thought, ""Be careful, lady!"""

John Moore is a restaurant owner. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant.

When John heard about the restaurant, he went to see it. The place was very old and needed a lot of work. But John thought it was perfect for him. This made him remember his childhood. His mother worked in a factory, and John felt sad when he was alone. He wanted to have time for his family.

John's wife took care of the children and helped with the money. John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This was good for their children, Gary and Joe. They became very confident. When they were young, they talked to the customers.

Gary was a lively child. One time, when he was seven, he jumped into the bath and hurt himself. As he grew up, he did small jobs to earn pocket money. By ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend and had a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and woke up early.

Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he could cook as well as the adults. Sometimes, he was in charge and made over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would work in cooking.

When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant. Gary also started playing the drums and formed a band. John told Gary to focus on one thing, or he might not succeed in either.

John advised Gary to achieve his goals by age 30. If not, it might be too late. At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he finished his work very quickly and even helped others. 

Now, Gary has a successful TV cooking show, and John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary to work hard for what he wants because nothing is given for free. John believes that if children listen to even a little of what you say, it is good. Gary has listened and done well."
FCE_7,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is to know someone. If you know a person who knows someone else who is moving, that can help. But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you do not know anyone. Jo had just arrived in Dublin. She had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown place. She felt nervous when she took the train to go there for work. She did not think about why she was going. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to go to new places and have a better life. Some of her friends went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo's mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because many hostels are cold. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. But Jo did not know they were talking about her. She saw an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to her job at the post office and seemed perfect. Jo hoped it would be nice and not too expensive.

There was no line for this flat because it was looking for a third girl to share. The ad said ""own television,"" and Jo worried it might be too fancy for her. The house looked normal, a red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf came down the stairs. She looked unhappy. ""This place is bad,"" she told Jo. ""The girls are not nice.""

Jo kept going up the stairs. ""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I don’t like her."" Jo asked what happened. Nessa said the girl acted silly and talked in a posh voice. ""We don’t want her here,"" Nessa said.

Pauline, another girl, had bright clothes and hair. Jo thought she looked interesting. Jo introduced herself. ""I work in the post office,"" she said. Nessa said they were going to have tea. She got three mugs. One had ""Nessa,"" one had ""Pauline,"" and the last one had ""Other."" ""We can put your name on a mug if you stay with us,"" Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We like to see them in the sea, in movies, and on TV. But dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds tells us about this problem.

Dolphins are very smart animals. They can feel human emotions and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. We see dolphins in shows like Flipper and Seaquest. But these happy shows do not show the real life of dolphins. The seas are dirty and full of fishing. 

Many dolphins are disappearing. In the North Sea, the number of harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down a lot. You might think that dolphins are protected by laws and live in safe places. This is not true. There are no good plans to help them, and this could be a big problem for wildlife.

There are forty types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, we can find striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and smaller harbour porpoises. Striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea. We do not see them often, and we do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are social and were often found in places like the Thames River in Britain. Now, we can only find them in a few places in Scotland and Wales. The dolphins that are left show signs of stress.

It is hard to know why dolphin numbers are going down. Overfishing is taking away their food. If fish are caught in one area, dolphins may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets that they cannot see. Many fishing methods use big nets that can hurt dolphins. In recent years, many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. They have marks and cuts from these nets.

Dolphins can also get sick from waste in the sea. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies. When female dolphins have babies, their milk can have these poisons. There is a case of a baby dolphin that died from its mother’s milk.

Another big problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. Noise from ships and oil wells can disturb them. This noise travels better in water than in air, and we do not know how it affects dolphins yet."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind and body. It helps you feel good and stay healthy. Many people talk about fitness because it is really good for you. 

There are many reasons to exercise. It makes your muscles stronger and can change your body shape. It helps you stand and sit better. Exercise can also help you avoid injuries. It is good for your heart and lungs, and it helps your blood flow.

Exercise can help with feelings of sadness and tiredness. It can help you sleep better and reduce stress. It can also help with some health problems. 

There are many types of exercise you can do, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. But be careful! If you exercise too hard, you can get hurt. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are not sure what is good for you.

Good posture is very important. It helps you look and feel better. If you slouch, think of a balloon pulling you up. This can help you stand tall and breathe better. 

Stretching is also important. It helps your body move easily and prevents injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will feel more flexible and fit. 

A good exercise routine should include warming up, stretching, a workout, and cooling down."

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for a long time? They want to find the best shots of animals. Amanda and Owen work in East Africa, where it is hard to find them because they are always moving. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained a lot for six months. This has caused some problems. Owen said they had to buy a special tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud.

Amanda and Owen make great wildlife films, like their famous film about leopards. While people were watching this film, they were already looking for another shy animal, the jackal. Film-makers have traveled the world to film animals since television started.

I talked to Owen when he was at a safari lodge with other people. He said, ""We sometimes argue, but we make up quickly."" They do not see one person as the leader. They both understand animals in the same way. 

When they travel, they set up their tents each night. Now, they have a fixed camp. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before. They eat pre-packed meals that they heat up. Owen said, ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be stressful.""

It can be tough, but being in nature helps them get close to the animals. Owen remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would go away and then come back to greet her family and even their car.

Owen first worked with Amanda in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. Now, they spend four months in one place to get enough material for each film. Before they start, they must send a script for approval.

Owen said, ""Amanda and I worked well together from the start because we have the same ideas. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts. If we can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""

In this story about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra is getting ready for the World Championships next month. She teaches at a local school and trains in a supermarket car park. Suzie asked her if people look at her when she trains there. Kendra said she is too focused on her training to notice.

Kendra said, ""I want to be my best for the Championships."" She has a strict schedule to be fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries playing. Kendra is happy to have support from fans in England. She wants to make netball better known in the country. There will be more pressure because they are playing at home. People expect them to do well.

Their first game is against Barbados right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said they usually win against them, but it will still be exciting to play. The England team is ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. ""You have to work hard every day. There is no rest between games,"" she said. ""In the Championships, you only have one chance to win.""

Kendra has played netball for fifteen years. The game is now faster and players are more aggressive. ""We train hard to win,"" she said. But after the game, everyone is friendly.

Netball is also using more science to help players train. Kendra believes it is important to think and train like the best players. As captain, she wants to support and encourage her team.

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition will be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on this big event.

FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.

When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is like a small car. It takes her three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.

If there is a problem, Rachel can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.

The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. An instructor was with her. He told her what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot got sick. They wanted to see how she would feel in a small space.

Now, Rachel has dived six times. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was leaving some equipment to study the volcanoes.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. They release water that looks like black smoke. The water comes out very fast and is very hot.

The only time Rachel was scared was when she dived with an American team. They were using a long rope when there was a big explosion. Rachel thought she would die. They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was amazing!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the window, she sees the volcanoes. She feels wonder because no one else has seen them. Rachel studied black smokers for three years. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. People often decide what they think about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, and our voice.

Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard and graduated. She felt confident. She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she did not want to be late. She believed it was important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not look good at an interview, how can she be a good teacher?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who care about how they look are more likely to care about their jobs. Many people forget that looking professional is important. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a big accounting firm. When her boss retired, she wanted the job but did not get an interview. She asked why and was told she did not look like an office manager. They suggested she change her clothes before applying again. Janet was surprised because she thought her work was good and her clothes should not matter.

How we move and use our hands can also affect what the interviewer thinks. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message comes from the words we use. 38% comes from our voice, and 55% comes from our facial expressions. If our words and our face say different things, people will believe our face more. So, it is important that our words match our body language. Confusing messages can make the interviewer unsure.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion. Her interview went very well, and she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how happy she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She thinks she could have asked for more money if she had been calmer.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, says it is good to learn about the company before the interview. Reading the company report can help. You can mention something interesting during the interview to show you care about the company. Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and using short sentences. She says, ""Good communicators use short sentences. Poor communicators talk too much."""

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.

**A Darius (runner)**  
I have always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country and won a medal. Many people did not notice, which was sad. I hoped to get some money for training, but it is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there, and I have to be very disciplined. If my friends want to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but I need to work hard. My big goal is to go to the next Olympics - that would be amazing.

**B Gabriel (surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are early in the morning. If I want to be good, I cannot go to late-night parties. I do not mind this, but I love to sleep in. I have to give that up too. But it is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out. If I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning helped me get a job on TV, so now I am a bit famous.

**C Dieter (yacht racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in a big way. Some people say we act like kids, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so I love to come back and hang out with my friends. You cannot only think about sports all the time; it is not healthy. People know me in sailing, but I am not famous. I get nice letters from fans who want my picture, and I reply to every one.

**D Tomas (tennis player)**  
It feels great to walk on the court and hear the crowd cheer for me. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many people around. I like when fans see me when I am out shopping. But it can be hard too. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in sports. I focus on my game now and will think about other things in life when I retire, which is early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""My kids want everything they see. If it’s not a new sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three! I can’t buy everything. If I say yes, I feel bad because I know it’s not good for them. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This makes it hard for parents to explain why they cannot buy certain things. Children do not always understand why their parents say no, especially when they see fun ads on TV.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat. They want to give them healthy food, but they do not always know what is healthy. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel stressed because they have to say no to their children often.""

The rules for TV ads say that advertisers cannot tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Susan Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy things. So, even if they do not say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""

Shopping with children can be tiring for parents. One mother says she talks to her son about food and ads. She feels happy that he does not ask for things she does not want to buy. 

Some parents admit they are not always fair. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy treats for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and children want to enjoy that too. But sometimes, I get annoyed with their requests. If I am in a good mood, I might say yes more often. It is hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help parents by moving sweets away from the checkout area or by having play areas for children. Even if parents spend less money without their children, many would still come to shop if they did not have to deal with their kids' requests."
FCE_20,"Text: 'The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both guests and staff. 

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests' names. He uses a computer system to remember what guests like. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost a lot of money to set up, but it will help the hotel save money in the future. 

For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, the hotel will have that music ready for them when they come back. 

Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can set it between 14°C and 25°C. 

The hotel also has special technology for business guests. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for new technology by adding extra cables and renting televisions. This way, they can change to newer models easily. 

The hotel has 145 comfortable and welcoming rooms. There is a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. 

The food is very good. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has made a new kitchen that is modern and better than before. 

With great food, good technology, and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful.'"

Emma Marsden asked six women how they get their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann** (Journalist and author): ""I get energy from excitement. I like challenges and learning new things. Dancing gives me energy too. Right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. If I am bored, I feel tired. Doing something useful, even a little, makes me feel good.""

B. **Linda Kelsey** (Magazine editor): ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I love my job. If you like what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need sleep to feel good. I try to sleep enough. Exercise helps me feel energetic, but I need to find the energy to do it! I do yoga once a week and some workouts at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. In the afternoon, I often feel low, so I try to eat something then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale** (Disc jockey): ""I don’t eat healthy food for energy. I think being positive gives me energy. I don’t like negative people. I believe we should enjoy life. I love my job and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many young and lively people. I like taking photos and writing fun song lyrics when I travel.""

D. **Floella Benjamin** (Author and children's TV presenter): ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in my work and being positive helps. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Smiling at people makes me feel good. I try to eat healthy food and I don’t smoke or drink. I get energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach** (Author and playwright): ""I love making gardens from empty land. I once turned a concrete area into a garden. It was better than any exercise. I also get energy from knowing people want to read my writing. I like exploring nature, even if it is private land. It feels fun and childlike.""

F. **Katherine Monblot** (Therapist): ""You need to care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don’t want to do makes you tired. I used to be on many committees, but I didn’t like it. You have a limited amount of energy, so use it for what is important to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating is a fun activity that people have done for many years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. Later, they started using iron skates. In Scandinavia, skating was important for rich people. 

In the early 1900s, skating became popular. A young girl named Sonja Henie showed a new way to skate at the 1924 Winter Olympics. Now, skating is both beautiful and hard work. 

If you want to learn to skate, you need to balance and control your body. To balance, keep your legs slightly bent and lean a little forward. Relaxing is very important when you skate. 

To start skating, put your heels close together and turn your feet out. Push with your back foot and move the other foot a little. It is easy! As you practice, you can make bigger movements. 

Learning how to fall is also important. Even good skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps you not get hurt. To get up, use your hands to kneel and then stand up. 

Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, and speed skating. It is best to start with figure skating. Many ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn. 

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate well, you should practice exercises for your legs, back, and shoulders. Warm-up exercises are important to avoid getting hurt. 

Skating helps you balance, move better, and stay healthy. It is good for your heart and lungs. When you skate with swimming or jogging, it helps you stay fit and strong."

Seeing a child win a medal can make you very happy. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives.

A. Annika Reeder is 15 years old. She won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the Olympics. ""I work very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV or go out with friends. I focus on gymnastics and school. Sometimes I feel very tired, and my coach gives me a day off, but usually, I keep training. If I take too many days off, I get stiff.""

B. Annika's mother says, ""Annika has always been very talented. Some parents push their children too much, but Annika wants to do this. It takes a lot of time and energy. People say we give up a lot, but we love the sport and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was shy, but now she is confident and has friends from all over the world.""

C. Sarah Stokes is 10 years old. She started show-jumping when she was 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""My parents love show-jumping. They train me and take me everywhere. The shows can last from one to five days. I love it! I want to qualify for the British young riders team and win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. Sarah's mother says, ""Sarah loved horses from a young age. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To compete, we travel all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is very happy on a horse and knows what to do. It is wonderful to see your child succeed at something they love.""

E. Jane McShane is 10 years old and is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone and it is fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t want to feel embarrassed.""

F. Jane's mother says, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. Jane loved chess right away. By 6, she was beating adults. I am happy when she wins, but if she wants to stop playing, I will support her. I want her to use her talent and be the best she can be."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already very tall. Now, he is the tallest man in Britain at 228 cm.

Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were a long time ago. We are getting better food now, which helps us grow taller.

A scientist named Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago. Long ago, people ate many different foods. Women picked fruits and herbs, and men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants.

About 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed how people ate. Now, most people eat mainly three plants: wheat, rice, and maize. This diet is not very good for health. Many people became sick and underweight when they started farming. In Ohio, scientists found that healthy hunters became sick farmers when they grew corn.

Farming spread because it could feed more people. But many people still do not get enough good food. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets getting better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

Even though people are getting taller, some things have not changed. Beds are still 190 cm long since 1860. There is less space for legs in planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often.

Scientists wonder how tall people will get. They think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. But there is a problem. While some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, humans are getting smaller. A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we are getting thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might get even smaller."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""

Some people think studio audiences are not important. They say that even TV workers do not care about them. I thought studio audiences were just made up of silly people who want to be on TV. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different jobs and backgrounds. TV shows want different types of people to watch.

Many people at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for a long time just to watch TV? One reason is that people hope to be on TV for a moment. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said, ""I came for a chance to be on TV.""

Another reason is that people want to see how a show is made. But many people go because a friend gave them a ticket. Most of us have not been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers, and someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH. You clap or laugh when you see these signs. This is true for some shows, but not all.

One studio manager said, ""We think a show should be good enough not to need these signs."" But is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch at home, you miss a lot.""

What I missed was seeing the actors live. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a monitor. Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch TV, but for most people, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to the village of Lastingham. Cycling was fun and helped me relax. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also new. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first travel writing.

**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive. The view is not amazing. The train goes over fields with sheep and next to a canal. But I love one part of the journey. The train goes through back gardens. For a moment, I can see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding chairs. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and the sea. It makes me look closer and find new things.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. Some surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and has many shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast and into beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open area perfect for hiking. There are not many people living or visiting there. It is quiet and empty, and I like the space. I found this place by chance when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, sometimes with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but I went to school in Devon, England, when I was twelve. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you would never come back. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We love animals and enjoy having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She found a pine snake and asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals like this. 

I got home late and started to boil some water. Suddenly, I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. The problem was with our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca. Bianca was a gift for Mother's Day. 

Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth. He wanted to escape with it. I jumped into the room and tripped over something. I fell on the floor. I saw the snake escaping from the table and onto the floor. 

The snake was moving fast, and the kids were jumping around, screaming. The dog was barking. The pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and went back to help. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse from him. 

I looked at the snake. It seemed strong and I was worried. I sat on the floor and tried to calm the snake. Slowly, it relaxed and rested its head on its body. I carefully lifted the snake and walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to let it go near a tree. 

When I let go of the snake, it surprised me. Instead of running away, it climbed up on my shoulders like a warm scarf. My four children and I stood together with the snake. My oldest son, DJ, said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not."" 

I asked the kids to help me encourage the snake to move. Slowly, it went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake went away, my three-year-old son, Clay, said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"**Drop Me a Line!**

In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is becoming rare. But I love getting letters. There is a special joy in seeing a letter arrive, finding out who it is from, and reading what it says.

I have written letters for a long time. I started by writing little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I was 18, I moved to London to study to be a doctor. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote to me too, and I loved his funny letters. Most of the letters from home were about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.

I also got letters from my boyfriends. They had to work or study far away, so we wrote to each other. Writing letters helped our relationships. I found it easier to say what I felt in a letter than in person.

I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but I love getting news from a whole year! It is even better when the letter comes in airmail with pretty stamps. I get letters from friends in other countries, like Sri Lanka, Australia, and Canada. I also have a friend in France. We started talking in a restaurant, and I asked for her address. Now we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her, and we have visited each other.

This summer, my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. People were surprised that we wrote for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about us!

I am happy that my children are also writing letters. Like my mother, I make them write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas too.

I hope everyone keeps writing letters. It is a special way to connect with others!"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Hurt Old Rock Art**

Many old pictures on rocks in France are being damaged. There are 36,000 drawings in Mont Bego, a famous place in the French Alps. These drawings are very old, about 4,000 years. They show cows, fields, and gods. 

More and more people visit this place, but some do not take care of the drawings. Jean Clottes, a leader in rock art, says that if people keep damaging the drawings, they will be gone in 50 years. He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and hurting them. Some people even take pieces of the rocks home. Others rub the drawings to take better photos. 

Some visitors bring sticks to scratch their names on the rocks. Experts have different ideas on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, a museum director, thinks the best way is to close the mountain to the public, except for guided tours. He believes this will help save the site. 

But Jean Clottes thinks this idea is too strict. He says it will make local people unhappy. David Lavergne, an architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says it is hard to stop visitors from damaging the area because there are not enough guards. They might need to charge money to visit the site.

Annie Echassoux, who studies the site, is worried that more tourists will come because it is easier to reach now. She believes they should block off some areas and have guides. She says it is important to find money to protect the drawings because they are a historic site. If they do not act, future generations will lose these important drawings."

FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

Climbers used to go to the mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, inside or outside. The crowd is quiet. High on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is in a big climbing competition in Birmingham.

The place is called the National Indoor Arena. It is known for the TV show Gladiators, but it also has climbing competitions. This is possible because of new technology.

Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. When they could not use cliffs, they climbed on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and not get bored.

Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls. These walls had special bricks to hold on to. A teacher named Don Robinson built a climbing wall in a hallway at Leeds University in the 1960s. He put natural rock in concrete to make climbing walls.

In the 1970s, many climbing walls were built, but they had problems. The walls were straight up, but cliffs have different shapes. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed. Climbers got tired of the same holds.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material. He made shapes like those on cliffs. These shapes could be put on any wall and taken off when climbers wanted something new. French companies also made climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so they could build overhanging walls easily. This gave climbers many new holds to try."
FCE_61,"Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone this, they might say it is risky. Acting can be a risky job. There are many actors, but not many jobs for them. When you decide to be an actor, some friends may think you are crazy. But everyone has different opinions. It is your choice, and you are responsible for it. 

There are no easy ways to become an actor. You do not have to take tests, but there is no guarantee you will get a job after training. Success depends on luck and talent. People want new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.

What is talent? Talent is a natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person’s courage and belief in what they do. 

Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important thing is the moment between the actor and the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to perform.

Actors often do not know how they succeed. They understand some things about themselves and their skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they can be out of work one month and then get a chance to audition the next. 

Actors do not like to talk about their chances of getting a job. They find ways to deal with the stress of competition and rejection. No one likes to be rejected. From the start, when you want to be an actor, you say you are ready and talented. But if you do not care enough, others will not care about you either."

FCE_5,"**Two Brothers and Their Game**

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are in their forties and have big beards. They are playing a game called pichenotte. This game is special to them because their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought it from Canada. The family played this game every weekend and had a lot of fun.

When they moved to New Mexico, they still played pichenotte. Their grandfather made the game board from old wooden boxes. When friends visited, they were curious about the game because it was new to them.

Three years ago, Dave made a new pichenotte board because the old one was broken. People liked it, and soon friends wanted their own boards. One night, the brothers took a board to a sports bar. At first, people thought it was silly, but then they wanted to play!

Dave learned that pichenotte comes from a game in India called carroms. It changed into a game called squails in Britain, and then it came to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian name for the game.

In pichenotte, two to four people can play. Each player has 12 pieces called pucks. They flick the pucks across a round board. If a puck goes into a small hole, it is worth 20 points. There are also rings worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game has eight small posts that make it harder to play. A game usually lasts two minutes.

When people liked the game at the bar, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets. Many people came to buy them, and soon they had a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' for the best players. The brothers decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They work in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of strong wood and weighs 12 kg.

The boards cost $595 each and can be bought from their website. There are no professional pichenotte players yet, but the brothers hope to make a lot of money from their game. For now, they enjoy playing pichenotte in their free time."
FCE_41,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE

When you come to the Model Village, you may not believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land with many weeds. People thought it was not useful. One man and his wife worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful village you see now. 

They moved a lot of soil and clay to make the land look nice. They used machines like bulldozers, but many people also worked very hard by hand. They brought in about 1,000 tonnes of good soil to make the grass, flowers, and rocks.

In the Model Village, many trees and bushes were planted. They chose plants that could grow near the sea and could survive strong winds in winter. Most plants came from local garden shops, but some came from Canada and New Zealand.

Colin Sims had the idea for the village. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, special wood, and plastic. These materials can handle all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about the materials, but soon he became an expert too.

You will see that all the models are made to the same size and have many small details. This took a lot of patience and special building methods. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its good quality and care.

The way to make these models has been used in other model villages in England and in some schools where people learn about modeling. The buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not from one specific place.

One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. It is a typical stone house from the 13th century with a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest part of the village.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models. If you touch them, it can take a long time to fix them. You can take photos from the paths only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.

To enjoy the Model Village more, you will see buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to make the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village better. 

We also want to know if any models need fixing. We are always updating the models, and we need your help to know which ones to fix. We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures of famous people. These pictures often invade their privacy. Sometimes, pop stars take pictures with paparazzi, but this is not common. Most of the time, these pictures hurt the famous people when they see their private moments in the newspapers. 

Very few famous people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The PCC is a group that helps with these problems. Most of the time, these pictures do not help the public. For example, does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help anyone? The actress has complained about these pictures before. She was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, but she did not take action. It is surprising that the PCC did not start an investigation. 

The PCC should look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these bad stories? This could help stop newspapers from printing such pictures. If the PCC acted like a police officer, it would have some problems. How would it know when to start an investigation? Should it ask the famous person if they want to complain? 

Famous people might expect the PCC to help them, but they could be upset if it does not. The PCC would have a big job to check all the newspapers and magazines in Britain. Also, people might not want to feel embarrassed by an investigation. Many just want to forget the problem and move on with their lives. Some might be quiet because they have other secrets they do not want to share. 

One British comedian was secretly photographed on his honeymoon. He did not complain then or later when he was photographed again on a family holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would make fun of him. This fear is normal. People think they will be targeted again if they complain. It is hard to find an easy solution to this problem."
FCE_38,"Many college students get advice when they finish school and look for their first job. This article talks about finding a second job. We are not talking about people who want a short job while looking for a permanent one. We also do not talk about people who leave a job they do not like after a few weeks. 

This is for those who want to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and know what you want to do. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to focus on one area, move up to a job with more responsibility, or change to a different field. 

You should choose your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years. Future employers will look at this job when you apply for your next one. It should show that you are serious about your career. It should help you grow and give you more responsibilities. 

If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and then find your second job. Employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and are ready to work.

Juliette Davidson worked for three lawyers after leaving St. Aldate's College. It was a good first job because the people were supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. But there was no chance to move up. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have learned a lot, and my job has grown."" Her boss wanted to help her develop. Juliette's job title is the same, but her tasks have changed. She now does most of the letters and budgets. She also answers questions from important people and helps those who want to start their own business. Brenda includes Juliette in all her work and gives her special projects and events to organize."
FCE_17,"**Text: How to Be Confident**

Confident people seem to be born that way, but many learn to be confident. Here are five stories about how they did it.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was 25, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was scared, but I did well. Someone told me to take a university course. I was nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.

**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run our family business. I was scared and tried too hard. I thought being confident meant being aggressive. I learned that to be confident, I need to believe in myself. If work is too much, I don’t feel bad if I wait until the next day to finish some tasks. When things are hard, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel unconfident, so I talk to myself to feel better.

**C. Lisa**  
People think I am confident, but I often feel scared. I learned to look confident because it is important for my job in TV. Talking to people helps me feel calm. My mother gave me good advice when I was a teenager. She said, “Who is looking at you? Everyone is busy thinking about themselves.” I remember this often. I also think you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt braver.

**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I love my job. I have built my confidence over time. If you work hard and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident. I am popular at my restaurant, but not everyone likes me. That’s okay. You need to like yourself. My company has training courses that help me feel better about myself. It is good to set small goals and see what you achieve.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary. I sat in meetings and was scared to speak. Later, I found the courage to share my ideas. When I started working in politics, I was very nervous to speak in public. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day.” I also wrote down notes to help me. Everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret to confidence is to tell yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional. If the line breaks, you can keep it. I have many more."" He showed me a pile of beautiful kites. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, Malaysia. We looked at the big kite festival. 

In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms. Helpers held up the kites, and competitors held the lines of their kites. They waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person had four different kites to show. The kites were judged on how they looked, how stable they were in the air, and how well they flew. 

""Flying kites is not hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them is a real skill. Come to my home, and I will show you how to make kites."" I got five invitations that day, and I decided to go to his house. 

At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers in a big room. When it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but I could not. Instead, I drove to the south of the state, going towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with green rainforests. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A small boat was there to take people across. I saw a sign that said, ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" 

Before I started walking, I should have known that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I met Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, not thinking about the insects under my thin mattress. At night, it was very dark, and I heard many sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many animals were moving. 

In the morning, I saw a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning. I got very wet. I slid down the hill and wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also thought about my car getting washed away and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill. 

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" They were very friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of the people."
FCE_48,"What kind of shopper are you? We all go shopping, but we shop in different ways. Here are some people and how they shop:

A. Melanie, 22, dancer  
I love shopping! I spend a lot of money. When I have money, I go shopping. I cannot walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we shop together a lot. 

B. Brenda, 40, office manager  
I don’t like shopping. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks. I take my kids shopping for clothes, but I don’t enjoy it. I don’t buy clothes for myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and tell my husband I spent less money.

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager  
I only shop for what I need. I don’t like shopping and only go when I have to. I know what I want and I don’t want anything else. Shopping makes me tired.

D. Anita, 35, TV producer  
I like to look around sometimes, but I know what I want. I don’t waste time. I do have some clothes I don’t wear, so maybe I make mistakes when I shop.

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary  
I really don’t like shopping. I can never find what I want. The shops are noisy and messy. I am lucky because I get most of my clothes for free. I go food shopping once a week and do it quickly.

F. Lisa, 22, actress  
I am a happy shopper. I go shopping with my friends and we often buy things. I don’t always have something to buy, but if I see something nice, I will buy it.

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant  
I am a careful shopper. I like to shop, but I don’t buy a lot. I know what I want and I don’t spend too much. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I feel bad for spending too much money.

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker  
I love shopping, but not on Saturdays because it is too busy. I am a careful shopper. I have an idea of what I want and I look in many shops to find the best price. It takes me a long time!

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager  
I don’t like shopping. I work in the city, so shopping is not fun for me. When I have to shop, I don’t try on clothes because it is too much work. Sometimes the clothes don’t fit, but I don’t care too much. I would rather make mistakes than spend a lot of time shopping."

Bill is ten years old. He says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made.""

Flora is twelve. She has trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby for the weekends. I was happy at home, so I did not want to go at first. But now, I am very glad I came.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It is great fun. Children pay attention and remember better than adults. The kitchen is not always clean when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""

PET_21,"MONEY

What is money? Money is things like the pound, the dollar, or the franc. Money is different from things like grams or kilometers because you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that does not cost much to make.

A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, traded corn for honey with Mr. Hive. They both had something the other wanted. Over time, many societies made their own types of money, called currencies, so people could trade more easily. Now, most people use a national currency."

Grass is a very successful plant. There are more than 9,000 types of grass. You can find grass all over the world. Grass can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. 

Grasslands are home to many animals. There are small insects and birds, and also big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to live. 

Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. Unlike other plants, new grass grows from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass will grow again for them to eat."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai is a young woman who loves fashion. She just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. When she was a child, she liked to draw clothes and make designs. She did not tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to work in fashion. She thought they wanted her to have a different job, so she went to university to study management.

After university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising company. She went to many events but could not buy the nice clothes she wanted. So, she started to make skirts and tops for herself. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. 

Kal found a small shop in London that would sell her designs. The clothes were very popular, and none came back. This made her feel good, and she decided to leave her advertising job. She took a loan of £20,000 to start her own women’s clothing brand. 

Kal's parents were happy for her and said they would help her. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000.

In 1980, a director named Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. Ten years later, Tom was very successful. He was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood and made a lot of money for each movie. 

Today, Tom still acts in movies and has many fans all over the world."
PET_18,"Text: 'LITTLE CAT, LITTLE CAT, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? Bo is a little cat. One day, she went into a furniture van. The driver did not see her. He drove for a long time, over 500 kilometres. At the end of the day, the driver was hungry. He found Bo in the van. He gave her some milk. The driver called his last customers, but they did not lose a cat. It was late, so he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital. Bo's owner was looking for her. He remembered the furniture van that came to his neighbour. He called the company. Soon, Bo was back home safely.'"
PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cooler south. Many people call it the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is often late.

In the 1920s, there was a plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide by train. They built a line to Alice Springs, but floods made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just before Mark's trip. The train can go fast, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday.

The Ghan was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods by train from Darwin to the south would save time and money. The Ghan is the first train in the world to go north to south across a continent.

When Mark waited to get on the Ghan, he saw that everyone was excited. Many older Australians were ready to board. The first stop was Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip. Mark stayed on the train until Alice Springs. There, he went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. Climbing the rock is not popular now, so they just walked around it and watched the sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, they reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's journey was over. The train may not have been perfect, but it took him to some amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing Ben Nevis**

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first climb on Ben Nevis.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high, which is the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries.' These are big bowls in the mountain, halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is very hard, like ice.

Even though some people in my group were very good climbers, we took safety equipment. This included lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, but we still felt nervous when we started climbing. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard.

The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest climber, so I had to rest more often. The others stopped to help me, but when I caught up, they started climbing again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 meters, we reached Tower Ridge. It is very narrow, only 1.5 meters wide, and the mountain drops down a lot on both sides. We had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly.

After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. But it was misty when we got to the top. 

Going back down to camp can be just as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn can be dangerous in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. 

When I was safe in the tent, I could finally say I enjoyed the climb. But I was proud that I made it to the top!"
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week is very exciting! We moved to our new school building. It is a great place. The builders used wood to make it, like our old school. This new school is also good for the environment. 

The school took a long time to build. We watched the builders work. It was exciting to see them clear the land, but some nice land is now gone. The machines were very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the old school next door. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We can’t wait to use them when the new sports field is ready.

When you come into the school, you will see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us inside the school - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside. If we sing in our classrooms, it sounds like a concert hall!

You will also see a tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went to see it with our teacher. It spins very fast and is very big!

We took pictures to put on our website. Even though we are using the school, some parts are not finished. We are putting on a play for our parents, but we still have to go back to the old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year.

We are very happy with our new school. Our teachers say we will learn much faster now!"

PET_2,"A month ago, I did not know that I would be 30 meters above the ground on a Saturday afternoon in November. Now, I looked down at the river below me and understood why people like rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place was not very nice, but we had beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met ten other people in our group. Cameron came with his friends Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, and the others went rock-climbing. Then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud, but we were happy and excited about what we had done."
PET_23,"Letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. My handbag had my cheque book, address book, and my purse. The purse had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I lost it, it was too late. I was very worried because I am 72 years old and far from home. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. The bus driver said I could keep the fare.

I got home safely. Soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus. He said they found my handbag and would bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, and everything was inside and safe.

I want to thank everyone who helped me that day. I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"Sharks

Sharks are scary animals in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement in the water. This helps them catch smaller sea animals for food. 

Sharks are different from other fish. Most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive. They do not sleep much. If a shark is turned on its back, it can stop moving. This helps scientists study sharks better."

PET_53,"Text: 'Joining the Kirov Ballet

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I did not know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and then they spoke in English, so we could talk. 

Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a little sad. I even called her at night because I felt lonely. 

The ballet classes in Russia are harder than in England. I eat a lot to have energy. This helps me do well in class. In the evenings, I watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. 

Now, I feel at home here. I like to walk around the city and visit the shops. In December, it was very cold! I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was not very cold for that time. My room is warm and cozy. 

Right now, we are getting ready for a new show, and there is a competition for young dancers that I will enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

The Arctic is a cold place. In summer, many people visit to see the midnight sun. In winter, there are not many people. They have the snow and ice to themselves. 

In the late 1980s, people thought winter could be fun. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an exhibition in a special igloo made of snow. This igloo was in a small town called Jukkasjarvi, by the frozen Torne River. Many visitors came to see it. 

One night, some guests decided to sleep in the igloo. The next morning, they were very happy. This gave them the idea to make an ice hotel. Now, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world. 

Every winter, a team of builders, architects, and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They start building in December. Each week, a new part of the hotel opens until it is all finished on January 7th. The hotel is built outside, using snow and ice. Sometimes, the plan changes because of the weather. 

In spring, when it gets warm, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, it is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, even if it is very cold outside. Guests get warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves when they stay at the hotel. It is also good to bring sweaters, scarves, and thick socks. Guests should wear bigger shoes for thick socks. 

If you want to visit the hotel, you can buy warm clothes on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order them when you book your stay. The clothes will be in your room when you arrive. 

The ICEHOTEL is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. It is 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday. Many people came to the shop. About 6,000 people wanted to buy furniture. There were special offers. A leather sofa cost £45, but only until 3 am. A bed cost £30, but only from 3 am to 8 am. 

The shop usually opens from 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours. However, it had to close after only half an hour. 

A police officer said, ""We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry. They thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait in line. 

There was also a long line of cars trying to park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.

One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I did not have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. It was not safe to stay open. I will come back when they open again, but I do not want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter is a free-diver. She has four world records. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters deep while holding her breath. She swam back up without help. A year before, she went deeper but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. She was the first woman to break a man’s world record in any sport.

A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya believes safety and training are very important. Most free-divers focus on one or two events, but Tanya trains the same way for all her events. She spends two-thirds of her training in the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she does not want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit.

When Tanya practices diving, she travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her to not get tired, or it can ruin her training.

When she is not training, Tanya makes public appearances to promote sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research and making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring the sea life in rock pools. She says her life now is like her childhood dreams. Because she is famous in some countries, people listen to her talk about the environment.

Tanya is now in her thirties. She wants to keep breaking her own world records. She started free-diving when she was twenty-five, and she does not plan to stop for many years."
PET_12,"CARTOON FILMS

Cartoon films can be very fun. If you can draw, you can make your drawings move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for everyone. 

In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for kids. But some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and kids can enjoy cartoons together. 

Not all cartoon films were good. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well. It was too scary for kids and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this. Now, many cartoon films make a lot of money again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role. 

""I never thought I would spend my first year at university making a TV show called The Finnegans. I only acted in school, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I always wanted to play her. 

I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She said they wanted to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the part. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and asked him to meet me. I flew back and got the part! 

Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to write my essays. I didn’t tell my friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky. 

After university, I want to be an actor. My family is not in acting, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I have not received any offers yet. I don’t know how I did it all because I also had a busy social life.

PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can fly very far, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey usually tastes milder than darker honey.

A long time ago, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians valued honey a lot and used it as money. Today, people make and eat honey all over the world. Some studies say honey can help with tiredness and make athletes better. Honey is not just food; it can help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair products."

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia in Britain. It has been a place to live for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, when the Normans came, it was one of the biggest towns in England. 

Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095. It celebrated its 900th birthday recently. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years of being a city. This meant it could govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than London or Manchester. It has about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second city of England. For 300 years, it grew and became rich. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs.

In 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a busy place for business. It has theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centres. There is also a football team called 'The Canaries' with green and yellow colors.

One new place in Norwich is 'The Castle Mall', a shopping centre. For over two years, there was a big hole in the city while builders worked on it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. 

The people of Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping centre. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a nice mix of old and new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky in Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, is full of bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. It happens every year for nine days. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons that took off from a parking lot in Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries will come.

**What to See**

The pilots talk to each other on radios. They light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow."" It is a great time to take pictures. You should come just after night falls or before 5:30 am to see the ""glows"" as the balloons go up into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are in many sizes and colors. Some look like animals or cartoon characters, and some look like popular drinks and fast food. Kids will enjoy it!

In the afternoon, you can fly in a balloon over the desert with one of the many companies that offer rides. You can also take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride, and you can see the festival from above. There are many other fun things to do, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This helps pilots control where their balloons go.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets online before the festival to avoid long lines. Wear several layers of thin clothes because it can be cool at night and in the morning, but during the day, you need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and don’t forget your camera. If you use film, make sure to get high-speed film for night pictures."

PET_11,"Some people have said they do not like this year's book, New Writing 3. I do not understand why. This book has 500 pages of good writing for £6.99. Most of the book is fiction, which means stories and parts of novels. There are nice stories by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. 

Some less famous writers write a lot about food. For example, Jane Harris wrote a story called Those Nails. Do not read it after you eat because it has some very bad scenes that might make you feel sick! 

There are also poems from nineteen poets, like R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can read parts of novels that are not finished by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. There is a little non-fiction too. One funny article is by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers. Ursula Owen wrote an amazing piece about herself.

PET_14,"**Learning the Violin**

Margaret Porter is a violin teacher. She says the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is when children learn a lot about the world. Margaret lives in London. She likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who really want to learn.

Margaret started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first class had her children’s friends who were five years old. In her classes, students learn in groups. Each group has about twelve students. They have lessons for one hour, every two weeks. Each student also has one lesson alone with Margaret every week. 

Parents must come to the lessons too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons. In the beginning, students learn to play music by listening. They do not read music for a long time. At first, their playing and reading music are very different. 

Margaret says her way of teaching is not to make great violinists. If a student plays very well, she suggests they learn with other methods."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine has a new CD. It is called ""Here Again."" This is their third CD. It comes after their last CD, ""The Waves."" 

There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott plays the bass guitar now. He replaces Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer. 

The first song on the CD is a dance song. The band is not making slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is very loud. Many fans will be surprised by these songs. They are very good and could be popular.

The singer, Rob Letchford, sings very well. He can reach all the notes. Fans are happy he recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. If you bought tickets, do not worry. The concerts will be rescheduled when Rob feels better.

On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles. They have slow songs and dance songs. I think the best songs are at the beginning, and the last songs are not as good. 

""Here Again"" will be a big hit and help the band become more successful."

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to see this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. San Francisco Bay is a beautiful place, but it was found by land, not by sea.

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to look for gold. But the people who got rich were not the gold seekers. The rich people owned banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

Today, many tourists visit San Francisco. They want to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some people even take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

Pepys talks about his home life, too. He had fights with his wife but they made up. He worried when she was sick. He liked music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. 

Pepys was a busy man with many important jobs. He was a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society. He is also known for his work with the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

A long time ago, shoes were not very comfortable or stylish. People used animal skins to cover their feet. They tied these skins around their ankles when it was cold. 

Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton. This depends on what is popular at the time. 

About 150 years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were the same shape and could be worn on either foot. 

In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines help make many shoes quickly and at a lower price."
PET_20,"When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running. I started a running club for women in my area. I was upset because many race organizers say there are not enough women in running, but they do not make good places for women to change. 

I made posters, and 40 women joined my club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. They wanted to lose weight, but many had not thought about running before. They thought running was hard and painful. They did not think about having fun, talking, and smiling while running in nice places, like by a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute. Now, they can run for thirty minutes! They also learned about healthy food and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and I am very happy to see how much they have improved. They are happy too!"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people came to Alaska to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means ""far, distant place."" In 1909, Iditarod became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In summer, boats brought supplies to the towns. But in winter, rivers and the ocean froze, and boats could not come. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at ""roadhouses"" to sleep and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes became the main way to travel. But in 1925, there was a big problem. A disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine was far away in Anchorage. Airplanes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. So, they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.

The trip was over 1,000 kilometers long, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian man looking for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo. Togo was very good at finding the way in the snow.

The last part of the trip was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped the team from falling into icy water. They got the medicine to Nome, and Balto became a hero.

Now, every year, there is a dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome. This race follows the famous route from 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""
PET_45,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**

The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Sweden. In winter, it can be very cold, up to -40 degrees Celsius. Many people visit this place every year. They come to see a special hotel made of ice. 

In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in ice rooms. You can even have a wedding there! The bar is made of ice too, so you should not put hot drinks on it. The bedrooms are about -4 degrees Celsius. But don’t worry! Guests get special sleeping bags to keep warm. You can also get warm clothes if you need them.

The hotel is only open for six months. In summer, it melts. Every winter, workers build it again. They use 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow to make the hotel."
PET_29,"Maria Mutola

In 1988, Maria Mutola played football. She was the only girl on a boys' team in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one cared that I was a girl. But then the other team got upset.""

A man named Jose Craveirinha read about Maria in a newspaper. He helped many African athletes. He went to see Maria and found her playing football. He saw that she was very fast. ""He talked to me about running,"" Maria said. ""I did not understand. I only knew about football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was hard work, and my legs hurt.""

Jose spoke to Maria's parents. He told them she could be successful and help the family. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, Maria went to train in the United States. She was scared to go because she would miss her family.

In the US, Maria met other girls who were good at sports. But their lives were different. ""They worried about clothes and make-up,"" she said. ""I worried about my family having enough food. They did not know my problems. But I was happy to be there. The trainers were great, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs. She lives in South Africa with her mother for most of the year."
PET_57,"The Skywalk

The Grand Canyon is in the United States. It was made by the Colorado River. Many people visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and see the view. The view is very beautiful, and the Skywalk makes it even better. 

The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass. You can see the pretty rocks below you. Up to 120 people can stand on the Skywalk at the same time. It opened in 2007, and many people have used it since then. 

You must wear special covers on your shoes to protect the glass. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air."
PET_9,"THE ROCKIES

The Rocky Mountains are in North America. They start in the North-west and go down south. The Rockies are not as high as the Alps, but they are very beautiful. There are many roads in the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. 

You can start your trip in Vancouver. Vancouver is a nice city in Canada. You can see water and mountains there. People can ski just 15 minutes from the city. 

Before, thirty trains left Vancouver every day to go across the country. Now, there are only three trains a week. But the train ride is still very exciting. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you see the beautiful views at night."
PET_42,"**ZOOS**

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years. A long time ago, the rulers of China made a big zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In early zoos, animals did tricks for visitors. Now, this does not happen. Today, zoos are places where people can see animals acting naturally.

Most cities have a zoo or a wildlife park. Some people think zoos are good. They say zoos help us learn about nature and see wild animals up close. 

But not everyone likes zoos. Some people think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They say that in bad zoos, animals live in dirty places and do not get good food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, age 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from other high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, and other bands wore bright T-shirts. We did not look like professional adult bands, but we played very well. Everyone was young, but we were used to performing. 

Each band made new songs on stage. It was fun to watch, but it was even better when my band played! My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to play can be in the band. But anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. 

We go on trips to jazz summer camps in the country. I have been to a few and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not hard enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can make your own music, but you also feel part of its history when you play on stage like great jazz musicians did before. 

My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who help us. Without them, we could not do well with our music!"
PET_54,"**Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. It does not rain often. When it rains, the water pipes cannot hold all the water, and the streets become like rivers. Many winters have been dry, so when it rains, the people are happy.

Marrakesh has parks and gardens, but they do not get water from rain. They get water from underground channels. These channels were made a long time ago, in the 11th century. They bring water from the mountains all year.

Places that are mostly dry and get water this way are called oases. 

If you go south from Marrakesh, you will find Skoura. In Skoura, people use all the land to grow food. There are small squares of land with water channels. The Atlas mountains, which have snow in winter, look beautiful in the background."
PET_32,"**Gareth Ellis**

Gareth Ellis is 13 years old. He is the youngest son of Alan and Kath. Alan is an engineer, and Kath is a nursery teacher. Gareth has two older brothers who work in banking and computers. But Gareth wants to be a clown.

Three years ago, Gareth and his parents joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it is true. Gareth wanted to be a clown since he was three years old."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath looked for jobs in the circus. They both got jobs, and Gareth started to train to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo.

In the summer, they travel with the circus. In the winter, they go home. Gareth's brothers can take care of the house while they are away. Kath says, ""It was not easy. We had to think about many things. We only had a small car and a tiny caravan to sleep in. We left our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long baths.""

Gareth says, ""People ask about my school. But wherever we go, someone teaches me. I use the same books as my friends at school, and I have a computer. I have not fallen behind."" 

About the future, Kath says, ""It was a hard choice, but this is the best way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I am happy, and we enjoy it."" 

Gareth says, ""One day, I will be the main clown in a circus, maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news group for young people. The members are between 8 and 18 years old. We collect news and write stories. We send these stories to newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites. You can read or listen to the news stories on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three places in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more places soon. Since we started in 1994, over 2,500 young people have joined us. Sophie is one of them. She says: ""I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they asked me about young people's thoughts on hip hop music. I met young journalists and saw the great things they did. Age did not matter; they could write their own stories. I went to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me do more than I thought I could. I learned many skills and got a job at 19. Now, I check articles for a big news website.""

**Join Us!**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and go to meetings every month. In these meetings, we decide who will write each news story. Members help each other learn. Older members, called ""peer trainers,"" teach new members basic journalism skills. Some of these trainers present to groups of young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, like in youth clubs and summer camps. They always have support from older staff.

Eight-eighteen News has training for new members three times a year. The next training will be in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is good for children with all reading and writing skills. Membership is free, and you do not need to take a test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

In the summer, we take tourists on a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, to see Antarctica and then back. The flight dates for next year are not ready yet, but if you book now, you can change your date if needed.

**Questions**

Here are answers to common questions about our flights.

**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours. After about 4 hours, we see sea ice and icebergs. We spend 4 hours over Antarctica and then fly back home. During the flight, experts talk about Antarctica and answer questions. There is a camera next to the pilot so you can see what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will move to the seat on your second pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and a seat at the end of the row for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, you can get up and walk around the plane to see the sights. The pilot flies in big circles so everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. The captain checks the weather on the morning of the flight and chooses the best way to see the views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife is far below the plane, so we cannot see them well. We do not land in Antarctica because it is better for the environment. If you want to see wildlife, you need to go on a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all cameras. We also have fun photo opportunities on the plane where you can wear cold weather clothes from Antarctica."
PET_35,"**Little Chefs**

Some children, aged ten to fifteen, spend their Saturdays learning to cook. Many kids want to join, so there is a waiting list of 30 children. Parents pay £280 for the course. The children have fun and learn to make good food.

Bill is ten years old. He says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made.""

Flora is twelve. She has trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby for the weekends. I liked staying at home, so I was not sure at first. But now I am very happy I came.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It is great fun. Children pay attention and remember better than adults, but the kitchen can be messy when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous for driving. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be on the road, and ice can be under the snow. A car coming towards you might slide on the road.

**Rule Number One:** Drive smoothly. If you move the car too fast or too suddenly, it can be hard to control. When you turn the wheel, press the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Think about driving with a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you do not spill it.

**Rule Number Two:** Pay attention to the road. Look far ahead, especially if there is ice. Test how long it takes to stop by pressing the brakes gently. You might be going faster than you think. 

When the road is wet, stop twice as far away as normal. On snow, stop three times as far. On ice, stop even further. Always try to keep control of your car to stay safe."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

Craigie Aitchison is a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, he found drawing hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He became interested in old Italian artists, and this can be seen in some of his paintings. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. 

Aitchison paints colors in thin layers, from light to dark. He says he does not know what the final painting will look like. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself."" He does not start with a plan for the colors. He believes anyone can use colors because you can buy them. He just pays attention to how colors look next to each other.

Unlike some artists, Aitchison does not make drawings before he paints. He thinks that if he draws first, he might get bored and not finish the painting. He changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes to paint people who do not want to see their pictures while he is painting. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since he moved to London, Aitchison does not feel part of the Scottish art scene. He is not interested in following old traditions. He just paints in his own way. Still, his work inspires young British painters."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our son Ben, who is 14 years old, asked us for drums for his birthday. At first, we did not want to buy them because of the noise. Ben said, ""It is better than watching TV or playing video games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""

This was just the start. The other boys in Ben's band came to our house with their guitars and other music things. Now, for many hours each week, our house is loud with their music and singing. 

When the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music is a little strange, they are nice and polite boys. I cannot say if they are good musicians, but they play at local clubs for young people.

We worry that they will not do enough school work because of the band, but this has not happened yet. I always tell Ben that his studies are very important. But one thing is sure: Ben was right. Playing music has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College. It is a good private college in Wales. The college helps young people learn about life outside the classroom and study for their exams.

The students are between 16 and 18 years old. They come from many countries. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do helpful activities. They might help on a farm, care for people with learning difficulties, or check rivers for pollution.

Atlantic College has students from different backgrounds. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants to help them. About 25% of the students are British, and many get help from the government to attend.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I admire the college for helping young people understand each other. You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you do not like them. During the summer, my mother saw that I argued less with my sister.""

In short, Atlantic College gives students a great education with methods that work well."
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an older student

I am 32 years old. I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes and I have to read books quickly and write long papers. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored. I did not have to think much at my job. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to feel that way too.

Now that I am a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers. Even though we are the same age, I know less than they do. But I am happy to study because I know I need a degree to get a good job. This is very important to me. 

I like to spend my weekends reading instead of going to parties, which is different from most eighteen-year-olds. I also enjoy the student benefits like long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema. Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school now is a good choice.'"
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started to work as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After he drove it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong and light steel to make cars that were cheap for regular people to buy. 

In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T'. It cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this meant people had less choice. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it is black."""

KET_13,"**CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are big birds that are blue and white. When autumn comes, they fly south to find warmer weather. It is very cold in Canada in winter, and the birds can die if they stay there.

Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. The young birds had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know what to do in autumn."" 

Bill had a small plane. He decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he flew his plane, and the young geese followed him. 

When autumn came and it got cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States. Virginia is 600 miles south of Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home.

This spring, Bill waited for the geese to come back. They did not come, so he flew to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks but could not find them. 

When Bill got back home, he found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home by themselves!"

After a few months, she sold her jam at the local market. Then she started making orange juice and sold it to a school where her friend worked.

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens. They sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep. Each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep. This helps the sheep not to get too warm.

Five years ago, Jenny made sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and hot, so people did not want to buy sweaters. Then, she made socks. Everyone loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started.

At first, Jenny made the socks at home. Soon, she had many customers. So, she sent the wool to a factory. Now, all the socks are made by machines. There are six colors and five sizes for all ages. There are also different socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers.

KET_10,"**BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON**

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told us that house burglaries have gone up by more than 30% compared to last year. He said that 67% of burglaries happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. 

Night-time burglaries are not common because families are usually at home then. But in winter, afternoons are good for burglars because it is dark and they can hide easily. Many houses are empty at this time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch other houses when people are not home. They should call the police if they see something strange. 

""We will also tell you how to make your house safe,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This help costs nothing."""

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming, people looked for plants and fruit in the forest to eat. They moved around a lot to find food. About 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow food. These people were the first farmers. 

Farming helped people stay in one place. Their villages became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers grew food for everyone. 

But farming was hard when the weather was bad. Sometimes, people did not have enough food to eat. 

Today, farmers can grow more food. The food travels a long way to reach our homes."

People can also get weather information on their mobile phones. 

Today, many people still believe old ideas about the weather. They say if the sky is red in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people think that if cows lie down in the fields, it will rain soon."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are 14-year-old boys. They live in a small town in Canada. They are good friends and go to the same school. They like to fish and swim on weekends. But for the last few months, they have been in Peter's room every weekend. They are not doing homework. They are making a new computer word game.

The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin. Kevin has trouble reading. He learns better with pictures and sounds. Frazer wanted to help his brother. So, Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make the game. Now, it is ready to use.

The game has pictures and sounds. For example, when you see the word ""hat,"" there is a picture of a hat, and you can hear Peter say, ""Hat! Hat!"" Frazer and Peter have won many prizes for their game. Soon, it will be sold all over the world. Many schools want to buy it."
KET_31,"HOW DOES THE IRISH POP GROUP 'BOYZONE' LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE?

Sleeping well is very important. When I go home to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. But after a concert, I find it hard to sleep because my head is full of music.

Sport is also important. Before my car accident, I went to the sports center for two and a half hours every day, five days a week. Now, I cannot do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups every day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat healthy food. I drink a lot of water because it is good for health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I do not always drink that much.

People should not work all the time. I love my job, but I also like to do other things. In my free time, I listen to music or watch TV. It is good to relax sometimes. I do not feel tired anymore since the doctor told me to eat better. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day. But I still eat burgers sometimes!"
KET_58,"**Bollywood**

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It makes almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is more than the USA, so it is the biggest film industry in the world. 

Many Indians like to watch films. Ten million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films often tell love stories, and there is a lot of singing and dancing in them. People outside India also enjoy Indian films. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.

Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs more than $5 million.

Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is a famous actor in India. He has been in more than 140 films and has acted for almost 40 years."
KET_37,"Bill Bryson

I was born in the United States. I have written many travel books about England. I lived in England with my wife and four children for 20 years. Now, we have lived in the United States for three years. Our children are learning about life in the United States. I think they will be happy because they have lived in two countries.

I like Britain and want to go back, but my daughter, Felicity, will start college here soon. So, I will not go back for four years. I just went to England for six weeks. I worked on a radio show about the English language and talked about my new book.

Most writers do not like to travel and sell their books. I do not mind it. I like to visit new places and meet new people. It is very different from my life in the United States when I write. In England, people drove me in big cars and I stayed in nice hotels. It was good because I did not have to pay for anything. Everyone was nice to me and it was fun."
KET_2,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes came to England more than 50 years ago. The Giant Schnauzer is newer in England. The Giant Schnauzer is big. It is 65 to 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair, and they need haircuts often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. 

Schnauzers come from Germany. Farmers use them to help with sheep. The police also use Schnauzers because they are very smart. Schnauzers are good family dogs. They are friendly and great with young children."
KET_23,"The Ruwenzori Mountains

Mary Daniels is a student in England. This year, she had a very interesting summer holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns.

Mary said, ""It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops to buy food."" It was also very cold and wet in the mountains. The Ruwenzori Mountains are one of the wettest places in the world.

Mary stayed in the mountains for six weeks. It was hard work, but she says it was the best thing she has ever done. She hopes to go back next year to help again."
KET_60,"Dear Keira, 

Thank you for your letter. Today was my first day at my new school. A girl named Nicole helped me. She showed me the classrooms. She is very nice. I will visit her this weekend. 

My favorite lesson today was Maths. I was happy because I knew more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time. I really liked it. 

Most of the teachers are friendly, but I am scared of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot. 

I must go now because I have to do my homework.

KET_53,"**The History of Horse Racing**

Horse racing is an important sport. It started a long time ago, about 4,500 years ago, in Central Asia. People in Greece and Rome liked horse racing too. 

Modern horse racing began in Europe in the 12th century when Arab horses came to Europe. At first, there were only two horses in a race, and the races were long. But in the 18th century, races became shorter and had many horses running together.

Today, many people watch horse racing in the USA. It is the second most popular sport after baseball. Horse racing is also popular in other parts of the world."
KET_55,"Nick Barlow is a world traveler. He is a British actor. He travels to many countries to make TV shows. ""People are nice to me everywhere,"" he says. ""When I go home, I remember all the good things from each country."" 

Nick has been to many places, but he wants to visit South America and go back to Australia one day. He travels with a team. They bring cameras and other things to make the show. Nick does not take many things for himself. He takes a few shirts and pants, but he always brings books in his suitcase.

Nick's wife, Helen, is okay with him traveling for work. She has many friends and stays busy. When Nick comes home, she likes to hear his travel stories. 

Sometimes, there are problems. When Nick was in the Malaysian rain forest, he heard that Helen was sick in the hospital. ""I felt very bad because I could not help her, but she did not want me to come home. I was very happy when I heard she was better."""
KET_50,"**Parrots**

Parrots are beautiful birds. They have nice colors and long tails. You can see them in forests or zoos. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They like to live in big groups. Parrots eat a lot of fruit, so they can be a problem for farmers.

There are many types of parrots. All parrots have strong beaks and feet. They use their beaks and feet to climb and hold food. Some parrots can live for 80 years. They are very noisy, but they are smart. You can teach them to talk. Some zoos have shows with parrots. You can watch the parrots do tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a pretty village about fifty kilometers west of London. A young man named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know his name yet, but he is already famous in France. He has written about many good restaurants in French magazines. He is 29 years old.

When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He liked this a lot, so he did not buy many clothes or CDs. Instead, he used his money to go to France and eat in good restaurants. He also has many cookbooks. He says he has more than two hundred and fifty!

Why did he open a restaurant? He loves cooking. Is it easy? He says it is expensive to start a restaurant. It is also harder to cook for fifty people than for his family. But he believes he made the right choice."
KET_34,"John Pickering

In a small park in England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers. Last week, he was in Tokyo. Many people in Japan watched him on TV because he is a famous singer there. John is 35 years old.

A few months ago, John sang in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya, Japan. A radio DJ heard his songs and played them on his show. Many young people called the radio to ask for his songs again. In Japan, John uses the name Jon Otis when he sings.

John will still work in the park in England. He does not know how much money he will make from singing. He says, ""I must keep my job in the park. I still have to pay my bills!"" The other gardeners do not know he is famous in Japan. They have never heard him sing.

John's wife, Denise, works in a hospital. She says, ""This will not change how we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"**Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have a new hobby called line dancing. You can find clubs and classes for line dancing in almost every town. 

Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it! Fiona Lever, a teacher, says, ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It is a great way to make new friends."" In her classes, there are both young and old people. The boys like it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet when they dance!

When did line dancing start? Most people think it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"The Rhino

There are five types of rhinos in the world. The Black and White rhinos live in Africa. The other types live in forests in Asia. Rhinos are big and heavy. Their skin is hard and they have little hair. Rhinos have four short legs. Each foot has three toes. They walk slowly, but they can run fast, up to 50 kilometers an hour. Rhinos are usually quiet and calm. They eat grass and plants. A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos when it is born. It stays in its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs more than 200 kilos and can live for 50 years."
KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

A long time ago, in 1700, there were no policemen in London. Only a few old men walked the streets at night to help keep people safe, but they did not get paid much. 

As London grew bigger, it became very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money, so people stayed at home to be safe. 

In 1750, a man named Henry Fielding paid some people to stop the thieves. They were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. After 50 years, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London was still very big and needed more help. 

In 1829, the first London Police Force started with 3,000 officers. Most of them walked, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all the police officers in London were men. 

Today, London police officers earn good money, and the few who ride horses earn even more."
KET_30,"TO ALL STUDENTS:

KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people go to Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, for the Edinburgh Festival. This festival happens for three weeks in August and September. The city is full of actors and artists from many countries. They come to Edinburgh for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are full of music and dance from morning to night. You can see artists painting pictures on the streets. 

One fun part of the Festival is the 'Fringe'. Here, students do funny shows in small places like cafes. Many tourists come to see new films, plays, and listen to famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred shows with actors from more than forty countries. The tickets are not very expensive, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. 

So, come to Edinburgh next summer! But remember, it can be hard to find a room. It is a good idea to book your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will find Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has come here for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need light but warm clothes: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

First, you break the ice and make a small hole. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer chocolate or another snack! 

Today, I have caught twenty-five fish! It is a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

Madame Tussaud's is a famous museum in London. Many tourists visit this place. In the museum, people can see wax figures of famous people. 

Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle was a doctor. He made wax figures of people and opened a museum in Paris. Marie helped her uncle with this work. 

In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie went to prison. In prison, she had to make wax heads of famous people who were dead, like Queen Marie Antoinette. 

In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and you can still see her figures today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

A bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were very expensive. Only rich people could buy them. These early bicycles looked very different from today’s bicycles. Later, bicycles became cheaper, and many people bought them. People started riding bicycles to work and for fun. 

Today, many people use cars more than bicycles. Cars are faster, and you don’t get wet when it rains! But some people still like to ride bicycles to work. They say there are too many cars in town, and it is hard to find a place to park!"
KET_63,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family for a beach holiday. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flowers, but we wanted to see the elephant show. 

We went to a big area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their trainers. They stood in front of a big white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its card. The trainers gave them new brushes with paint and took the old ones away. The elephants painted pictures slowly. I was amazed! One picture was of a river, one was of a tree, and the last one was of flowers. When the trainers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one.

We also gave the elephants bananas that we brought for lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore. The smartest elephants live in special places where people can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many kinds of cats. They are different in size and look. Tigers are the biggest cats. They can be 3.7 meters long from head to tail. Most cats do not like water, but tigers like to lie in water when it is hot!

Lions are the only cats that live in big family groups. Many lions work together to find food for the group. They usually live in flat, open places where they can see far and follow other animals easily.

All cats need good eyes to catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."

KET_20,"THE OSTRICH

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. 

Ostriches have wings like all birds, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, up to 90 kilometres an hour. This makes it hard for other animals to catch them. 

Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens. They take about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water."

It was easy to start snowboarding. You can learn quickly and get good in a few months."" 

We asked her if she practices a lot. She said, ""In winter, I snowboard every day in the mountains from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and ride my bike. I love it all! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains. It is very beautiful. But free-riding, which is when you do what you want, is the best for me.""

KET_64,"**Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people climb Kilimanjaro. They can be very young, like a seven-year-old boy, or very old, like an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and many tourists like it.

Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and rainy. But at the top, there is ice and snow, and it can be very cold, below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Otters

Not many people have seen an otter. Otters live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim faster than 10 kilometers an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This helps them stay under water for a few minutes.

Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty. Many fish and insects died, and otters could not find food. But now, the rivers are clean again, and there is lots of food for otters."

KET_59,"**Buildings**

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We also have museums to keep beautiful things.

Many people work together to build a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures of it. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers build it carefully.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous building. It has a beautiful roof. But the building looks nice from all sides, not just the top. The Olympic Stadium in Munich is also famous. It looks like a tent made of glass."

In 2004, Gail ran her first half-marathon, which is a long race. She won and had the best time of the year for any British woman runner. 

Gail's husband, Mike Rollins, was also a runner when he was younger. He had to stop racing because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him.

Gail trains hard. She runs long in the morning and fast in the afternoon. She takes a break from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should eat that?' It is usually cake, but she can eat almost anything."""

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. When he was twelve, he studied music in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano, but he taught Ivan and his sister songs from the opera. Ivan's mother taught him to play the piano when he was six years old. At ten, he wanted to write music, so he started his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who liked to play the piano, taught him some Russian music. At six, Oleg began lessons with a piano teacher in his city. He won prizes for his piano playing. When he was fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. After that, he went back to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German, but he taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two years old. A year later, he started to play the piano. He had his first concert when he was six. At ten, he gave fifty-two concerts in two months in England! Josef loved music, but he also liked physics and languages. He is very busy now, but one day he wants to write his own music."

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist. He became a writer of children's books when he was 60 years old. Now, after 13 years, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me if she does not like something,"" says Bill. 

Bill's ten grandchildren do not live close, but they read his stories and tell him if they are good or bad. This helps Bill know what children like to read. He writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His favorite book is called The Sheepdog. It is about a farmer and his dog that helps him. 

""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill. ""Dogs are very smart, and they learn quickly."" Last year, they made a film of his book with real animals and actors. The people who made the film used new technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes, they change books for movies, but they did not change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"POSTCARDS

Today, people like to send postcards to friends and family. Postcards have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are cheap. The pictures on postcards are often better than their own photos.

The first postcard was sent a long time ago, at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed news events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these postcards because newspapers did not have pictures then."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago. This was a long time before people were on Earth. We do not know why they all died. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds.

Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest dinosaurs were larger than any other land animals. 

For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs."
KET_41,"Bears are big animals. They can be dangerous. An adult bear is very strong and can hurt a person. Bears can climb trees and run fast. But they do not see well. They find food with their noses.

There are seven types of bears. The biggest bear is the white polar bear. It can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears. One lives in North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black. They can be dark brown or reddish brown.

Many people love the black and white panda bear. Pandas come from China. There are not many pandas in the forest now because it is hard for them to find food."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm places like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They like to stay in slow water, but they can swim fast and run fast on land. You can see many crocodiles together in groups. They eat fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they can eat big animals or even people.

There are more than ten kinds of crocodiles. All crocodiles have very sharp teeth. They can lose their teeth, but they grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are bigger. They can live a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo was 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon to take people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers made the first plane with an engine. They flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service.

Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world. It can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours.

Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane. It is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different. The building was round and had no roof. If it rained, people got cold and wet. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to see plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. Visitors ate food, talked to friends, and walked around during the show. Some people even threw things at the actors!

Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place by the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play or learn about life in the 1600s."
KET_48,"Dear Jeff, 

I am having a nice holiday in Australia. Two weeks ago, when we arrived, the weather was bad and cold. Now, the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week, we are in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is warm, and I love swimming there. The fish are many colors: red, yellow, and purple! Australia is very beautiful. We do not want to go home! 

See you at the end of September. 

Sue"
