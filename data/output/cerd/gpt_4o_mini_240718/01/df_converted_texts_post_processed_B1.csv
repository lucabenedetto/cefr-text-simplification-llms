**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it might not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, people have a regular garbage collection service. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to a dump. This service is usually free for families, even though they pay for it through local taxes. A family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. But the cost of getting rid of rubbish is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more local governments have to pay to dispose of it.
If rubbish disposal is free, people might throw away too much rubbish. A possible solution is to make families pay for the amount of rubbish they produce. This could encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, as long as local governments provide places to recycle.
Two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, studied this idea in several towns and cities in the U.S. that started charging families for their rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that families had to put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags would be picked up.
In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a program started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents had to pay 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seemed like a good idea, the costs of running the program were higher than the benefits. The number of bags thrown away did decrease by 37%, but this was mostly because people started cramming more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more tags. This method of compacting rubbish is not as effective as using machines at dumps. The total weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing system, the weight of rubbish also fell, but by only 3.5%.
Some people even started dumping their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors believe that illegal dumping might explain 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, the amount of recycled materials increased by 15%, suggesting that people chose to recycle instead of paying for rubbish removal. However, many people were already recycling before the new fees were introduced.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish disposal in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. For example, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduced the amount of rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.
It is also important to consider other factors, like income and education. In richer towns, people tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. Should we say that charging families for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really, because free disposal is too cheap. However, the effects of simple policies can be complicated. Understanding these effects often requires detailed economic studies, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Change: Theodore Zeldin's Ideas**
Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could be different. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Just being successful in your career is not enough anymore. Many people in different jobs feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. 
In the past, loving your job was enough to make you feel special. Now, you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and unable to talk to others outside your job, or if you are too busy to think creatively or have fun, then no amount of money or status will make you feel fulfilled.
Zeldin wants to find ways for work to help people feel fulfilled, instead of just making them fit into a system. Work should not only be about making money but also about living a meaningful life, discovering new talents, and meeting different people. However, just getting rid of unemployment is not enough. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and helpful.
Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and accountants, are now stressful and not as appealing. Many professionals feel unhappy and doubt their work. Companies and organizations are getting smaller, and new ideas like decentralized decision-making have not made employees feel more committed. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their values match those of their organizations.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He is looking at important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. He believes we need to think about how we can earn a living in more satisfying ways. While many experts focus on making companies more profitable, we also need to think about ourselves as human beings and who we want to work with.
Many people feel like they are not truly alive at work. They might feel trapped in their jobs, even if they can leave. For example, many hotel workers are smart and capable but work long hours for low pay and respect. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and connect. 
Hotel staff could use their knowledge to create better experiences for guests, but they are often limited by strict financial rules. Zeldin believes it is time to rethink what work means, focusing on human needs, not just money. 
Work should be about relationships. Many people want to feel independent and should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues. This requires good communication, which is different from just talking. Real conversation creates respect and understanding between people. Every meaningful conversation can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant to spread seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents hope for growth and success. It suggests that if we plan well, we can achieve a good outcome. The idea of broadcasting assumes that there are central resources to help spread information.
We need to understand why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, as a technology, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a central way to reach many people at once. This method matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some attempts to create different ways of using television. For example, in the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain tried to develop two-way television as a replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines shared articles on how to build television equipment, and many people experimented with it. But in 1938, big companies set standards for television that pushed these amateur efforts aside. This meant that in Britain, the chance for a more community-based form of television was lost.
Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the structure of modern societies. Even though TV enthusiasts were active, television was mainly used for public shows in the USA during the early 1930s. Many people watched television in public places, especially in Britain and Germany.
The idea of community-based or amateur television was not likely to succeed. Instead, television systems that focused on public viewing were common in several countries during the 1930s. However, manufacturers saw a chance to sell more home television sets, and as living standards improved, more people could afford entertainment at home. This trend is now happening worldwide.
There is a clear link between social changes and how broadcasting is organized. As societies modernized, power and wealth became more centralized, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile, which made them feel more isolated compared to earlier, stable communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with all citizens and created a sense of community in the nation.
While broadcasting has often been seen as a way to connect people, it also has a role in democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure everyone had access to important information for participating in society.
Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated. If that happens, it will only refer to a specific way of using audio-visual technology during a certain time in our social development."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel completely secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when wanting more things becomes too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. We often hear messages like, ""If you don’t have this, you are not as good as others."" To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in ways we don’t even notice. We see them everywhere: on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet, all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research centers and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves. They look at how caves form, how water moves in them, and the living things inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and push us to learn more, so a lot of research has been done on them. Because caves are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they affect our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many people, using only their senses, helped create the science of meteorology, which has developed into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools give us a lot of weather information very quickly. Computers can solve complicated math problems much faster than humans can. Meteorology uses many technical terms that can be hard to understand. However, human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. Observations from people can provide valuable information that helps professionals understand the weather better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Not long ago, I believed that opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is actually the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. However, I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the main focus. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.
At any music performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people who, like me, do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about how little they know. Most people are amazed by the talent of the performers. A great singer or a skilled group of musicians is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event. We know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of an actor and may not be very impressed by what they see, as it seems close to what they could do themselves. They do not usually ask how actors remember their lines, even after a long and difficult speech. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; many of them are the same people. It may mean that audiences and performers are more equal in theatre than in music, no matter how difficult the material is.
The question is whether music can learn anything from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can. I have seen how a different approach can change the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, full of emotions like passion, humor, sadness, and intimacy. It can connect with the audience's imagination, both as individuals and as a group. 
However, the way music is often presented, with strict dress codes and a lot of respect for conductors and soloists, creates a clear difference between performers and listeners. This can feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, when contemporary music audiences clap between movements or after a great performance, it can interrupt the flow of the music, even if it is a genuine expression of appreciation.
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done. Many projects are encouraging new audiences to attend concerts and operas, breaking down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a special event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in different locations within a cathedral and then in the town. It was a wonderful musical experience where professional musicians played a key role, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.
What I hope for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. Sometimes, this means giving up comfort; the sound might not be perfect, or it could be a bit cold. But theatre audiences have learned to be brave and follow artists into unexpected places. 
I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that music performances should change to make them more exciting. I am just a fan of both theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy the pleasure I get from being part of the audience."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I don’t really like it when it is just lying around. To me, sand is mostly a problem that gets in the way between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can hide important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to get off, even with a strong hose. But here’s the strange part: as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off you. For days, you keep finding sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would rather not have sand around.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home where they can feel private and secure. In the past, a simple rope was used to lock doors, but now we have electronic locks that work with plastic cards. However, many people still prefer the feeling of using a real key to lock their doors. Even when companies create new electronic systems, they often include a metal key because people like that better. 
**Modern Art**  
I was a bit worried about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do like some pieces, especially the furry ones, neon light sculptures, and big photographs. Maybe if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. But the important thing is not to understand everything perfectly; it’s about letting the art speak to you. This gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explained what each piece was about. Instead of just looking at the art without understanding, these labels helped me learn more about it."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films often means cutting down the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be helpful. While writing a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from the book and still keep the main idea. This does not mean that the original words were unnecessary. It is about how each medium, books and films, captures the audience's attention differently.
In a novel, some details about characters are repeated to help readers remember them. For example, we might see phrases like ""he said"" to show who is speaking. In a movie, we can often tell who is talking just by looking at the scene, but these tags can make it easier to follow. In stage plays, the dialogue often mimics real conversations, but sometimes it can be too repetitive, making it hard to understand the main message.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives, at least for the time the film lasts. However, when the movie ends and the lights come on, we return to reality. Many people do not feel guilty about spending time watching films, even if some older generations thought of movies as just entertainment and not real art.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. It was confusing to navigate because there were no clear signs. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped visitors find their way easily. Most people who worked there knew how to get around, and they created stories of romance and adventure that entertained audiences.
**Film-Makers**
Many people want to make movies. Bookstores have many guides on how to write scripts and produce films. Universities offer courses, and there are competitions for aspiring filmmakers. For example, Robert Rodriguez made his film *El Mariachi* for only $7,000 and became a well-known director. He wrote about how he felt pressure to succeed before he turned 26, just like famous directors did.
In the past, filmmakers had to work for years in different roles before directing their own films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made *The Maltese Falcon*. Today, without the support of big studios, new filmmakers often have to find their own way to create movies."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old houses made of orange brick or white plaster. In the summer, a bad smell from a factory nearby filled the air, and in the mornings, a paperboy often looked disgusted as he walked past the houses. I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses in the distance. I also have memories of my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on a big mansion.
My mother appears in these memories. She was a small, precise woman who was often angry, and I never understood why. Even as a child, I noticed that she was very lonely, feeling alone even in a room full of people. She had strict rules about how to behave, which I found hard to understand. For example, we were not allowed to walk into our neighbors' gardens or disturb their flowers. We had to sit quietly at the dining table, listening to the radio shows she liked. There were many rules like this.
Over time, I remember other people in my mother’s life. Despite being lonely, she had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always liked by the others. Looking back, I see that they often talked about their problems, like bad legs and the cold weather, and I sometimes felt like I was part of their complaints.
It felt like a heavy weight of my mother, her friends, and their strict rules was on my shoulders, and I needed to find a way to break free from it. Growing up in West Earlham was very structured. Until I was five, I mostly stayed at home. I remember long days playing on the floor while my mother sat in a chair, looking unhappy. After my fifth birthday, I went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers who could take them on bikes, but my mother usually let other children take care of me on the way.
I remember the summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his time at sea, and once there was a charity event where a kind woman offered lemonade. My mother, however, did not trust these events and thought they were just trying to take people’s money. She often spoke badly about politicians, thinking they were greedy.
I might be exaggerating my mother’s faults and forgetting her good qualities, but she did not show much kindness. However, she did care about my education. Sometimes, she would take me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. We would walk through the rooms filled with paintings. My mother didn’t mind this, and she even started to have opinions about the art. I remember one time she joked about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying, “I wouldn’t want to meet him at night!” This was a rare moment of humor from her."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. It was getting dark, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first friends, all girls. Even though I didn’t know everyone by name, I could picture each house clearly, just like the little channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. 
As the street went downhill, I noticed that the houses changed too: the porches became lower, and the front yards got smaller. Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how the people living there used those spaces and how they dealt with the smells of the products that used to be sold there.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and big doors that used to let in curtains from the nearby train. But Gilbert didn’t want a big empty space. He said it was hard to relax or work when everything was in view. So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large piece of corrugated plastic. This created a hallway and helped guide the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 
To make the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen look warmer, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His flat has modern chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture from his parents or things he bought at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who lived a very romantic and wandering life. His life and work were full of secrets and some lies, but he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was exciting like a thriller, beautiful like a romantic story, and insightful like great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction; he would change details to make the stories more interesting or to highlight what he wanted to say about travel and discovery.
**Swimming**
One summer day in 1996, warm rain fell from the gutter as I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. I swam back and forth, with my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created little fountains that turned into bubbles and popped. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the pool as if it was reaching for the sky. 
During this rainy summer, I started to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming in circles, like a tiger pacing in a cage. Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes us see things in a very visual way. That’s why walking, cycling, and swimming feel like acts of freedom. They help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of the world by getting off the main paths and discovering things for ourselves. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, he was likely wrong. Recently, scientists have shown that crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps create a strong bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that children cry mainly because they feel helpless.
It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as the way it looks. Crying may have helped early human groups by building trust and connections between people. 
There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sad movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. 
The social reasons for crying are clear, but research is still ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get and how will it change our lives? Most people know a little about global warming, but many are unsure about what it will mean for us. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere affects everything on our planet, any climate changes will have important effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to help us grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are serious. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how the heat balance of the Earth works, making it hard to predict the future.
We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed together with global temperatures for the last 40,000 years, showing they are related. Evidence suggests that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just a natural process but is partly caused by human pollution.
A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to help with these predictions. These programs analyze how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, but we know it is complex.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than we have seen before. The predictions from GCMs suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. Sea levels may rise by 15 to 95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Scientists also expect more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, in some areas. These changes will likely have a big impact on the environment and on humans.
Climate change can affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species in them, and their ability to provide resources we need. This includes food, water, and places to live. Some effects may be harmful, but not all changes will be bad. In some places, climate change may even have positive effects. For example, in Australia, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures, which have led to fewer frosts that damage crops.
However, many predicted effects of climate change are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry areas or places already facing water shortages. The Mediterranean region is one example where rainfall has decreased in some areas. In southern Portugal, for instance, more rain is falling in autumn and winter, while spring rainfall is decreasing.
Another serious effect of climate change is on glaciers. Changes in ice will affect plants, animal habitats, and human structures. There is a strong chance that the Arctic ice will melt completely, which could make shipping and oil exploration easier but also increase the risk of icebergs.
The most visible effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and because ice is melting. About half of the world's population lives near coastlines, so rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding could disrupt cities like London, New York, and Tokyo, leading to many people losing their homes and jobs, creating millions of environmental refugees.
The worst effects will likely be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear if the worst predictions come true. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands, as well as for the countries that would have to take in those who are displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"**Mission to Mars**
Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. 
The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, which is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. 
It is a big challenge, but there is a race to create new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might be able to go. Even if the mission does not happen, the work done will help future space missions."
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Sometimes, the existence of art makes it hard to understand art itself. This is because art is something we can see and touch, like a building, a book, a painting, or a statue. People often think of art only as these objects, not as what they mean or how they affect us. 
When a piece of art is very admired and becomes a classic, it can be seen as separate from the people and experiences that created it. This makes it harder to see its true meaning. Art then seems to belong to a different world, away from everyday life and human experiences. 
A key job for anyone writing about art is to connect these beautiful works with the daily events and feelings that everyone understands. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human life. 
To really understand art, we sometimes need to forget about the art itself for a moment. We should look at the everyday experiences that we usually don’t think of as art. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about how they grow. But if we want to understand how they grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. 
To appreciate art fully, we should start with the simple experiences that catch our attention and make us happy. Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips, but they don’t always see these as art. When people think of art as only what is in museums, they miss out on the joy found in everyday experiences. 
Often, people who argue against the idea of art being only in museums still believe in this idea. The best appreciation of art happens when it is connected to the things we do every day."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Many people think that lions hunting together is a beautiful sight. At sunset, a group of lions quietly moves from the shadows to catch their prey. They seem to be perfect social animals, working together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after studying lions in the wild for many years, we have a different view. 
When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off other animals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then working together does not always help. If one animal is too generous, it may lose out while others benefit. So, why don’t lions follow the usual rules of self-interest? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years, but lions are very good at doing nothing. 
It took many different research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to find answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was an important moment for the band. ""New Life"" changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. It moved away from the serious and dull sounds of the past and introduced a lighter mix of music styles. 
The album combined social observations and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. It included humor and irony, and the singers were proud of their backgrounds. Bedrock showed they were skilled at collecting ideas and writing songs. They wrote about traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. 
However, the album's true strength was in its deeper, sadder songs like ""So Low,"" which had a beautiful melody about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. ""New Life"" is impressive because it has 16 high-quality tracks with no weak songs, which is rare for long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. I first learned about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. In the end, he bought the last three for 300 gold pieces. I understood that there was an important lesson about sales and life in this story.
I was often a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something interesting so that the other children would want to join me. It worked, and it is a lesson I have never forgotten.
When I got the chance to write a travel book, I looked for a topic that mattered to me. I am not a big traveler, and I sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to visit. I am only interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read, called the slush pile. Usually, a junior member of the editorial team or an experienced freelancer will look at it. They do not have much power, but they want to find something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced person wants to keep their job.
If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor. This editor will discuss your novel in a meeting. They must explain why your book is good and how well it might sell. They will also consider if you seem like a promising author and how marketable you are, which is important for promoting a new book. Because of this, publishers often like to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were probably very hard for you. The economy was in a recession, which was worse and lasted longer than anyone expected. This affected many countries, including Britain. In 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. Over half a million people were unemployed, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business felt the impact, especially industries like cars and construction, which saw a 30% drop in work.
People in advertising were not the only ones losing their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, and they felt their work was being closely watched by their bosses and colleagues. At the same time, they had to do their jobs with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money.
Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies started to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies began to focus more on marketing. This change helped marketing professionals gain more respect, but it also added to their workload.
Marketing is often seen as a solution to many problems, but about half of marketing budgets go to advertising. This means that advertising agencies are under a lot of pressure to show results. The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the worst times for the industry in a long time. The bad economy made companies cut their advertising budgets and question the value of advertising. They wanted to know what they were getting for their money and if it was worth it.
Many companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working on their projects and expected them to produce great work. While this situation is tough for advertising professionals, it also means they face the same problems as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
Several factors made creating effective advertising even harder. The recession caused debates about production costs and made companies less willing to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes, like shifts in population, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, and stricter advertising laws, also made things difficult. Some companies even had to start advertising in other countries.
Because of the economic situation and these changes, advertising professionals had to think about the saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, they need to find ways to make their advertising more effective.
Unfortunately, help for those who want to improve their advertising is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their successful strategies private. This means that while some conferences and seminars might offer useful information, many books on advertising do not provide the help that people need. They often present advertising work as always being of high quality and great value, which is not true and does not help the employees who are responsible for the results."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was in university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people did not see cooking as a good job. Being a chef is hard work: it involves long hours, a lot of pressure, and low pay. However, these things did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. I thought being a chef would be a great escape from this. It seemed to offer a seriousness and honesty that I was missing in my college life.
My wish to cook was not just because I was unhappy as a student. It also came from a love for beautiful food. I first felt this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing. I still remember my starter. After that meal, I wanted to learn everything about cooking. I changed my student life to prepare for becoming a chef. My history degree felt useless, and I focused on cooking instead. I learned by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making fancy meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The swimming instructor at my school was a tough man, small and muscular, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until my time was up. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 
The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed and bent slightly down at the front. It looked very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a quiet bubble. I waved my arms like I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For people who value a comfortable bed, running water, and safety, the idea of a traveller can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on small boats. They might eat insects if they have to and can live for months in uncertain conditions. 
It is easy to think of these travellers as odd or unusual. They seem very different from our everyday lives, where we enjoy things like microwaves and answering machines. We can ignore them and feel thankful for our own safe lives, where the biggest risk is crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a world-class sailor, but he is good enough. He sails because he is a writer and wants to write about his experiences. Sailing gives him stories to tell.
Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere in the world. He likes this tool, but he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors do not pay as much attention to the waves and the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, has become just a space to cross. Because of this, a sailor can let a machine steer the boat for long periods. This is why Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. There are fewer types of people than there are individuals, so in the stories of others, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express our feelings in a way we might struggle to do ourselves. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their words, which is even more surprising if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves better.
Through reading and traveling, we can break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, just like when we read a great book. A good book can show us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of the details around us, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, or feelings we didn’t know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel thoughts were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important details. I could have made more changes, but that would take too long. For example, in my article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer be a report of that time. Like any traveler, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what had already happened. This is the real story of modern travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. But I don’t believe all travelers are completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term appeared in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to make sure their trips would not harm the places they visited. The term quickly became popular. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make better choices, the lack of rules and clear definitions has left many confused in the ecotourism world.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time, but it wasn’t always as useful as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one friendly house to another and often staying for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. I worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, so I added many warnings. But then I realized that this book is not a guidebook, so it didn’t matter much. I decided to let the story unfold naturally without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as something new, created by capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians say that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their studies in the 16th and 17th centuries when trade and markets began to grow. As societies became more complex and populations grew, new technologies were developed to make different types of clothing and accessories. Because of this, the meanings of what we wear have also become more complicated. Today, it is hard to say exactly what a piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit is often seen as a sign of uniformity, but it can mean different things to different people in different situations.
**Writer**
Reports about famous authors getting big book deals can give a wrong idea about what life is like for most writers. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to earn a living. The smartest writers work full-time jobs and write in the evenings. This way, they have a steady income even if their book does not become popular. Others, like me, do different jobs, such as teaching or writing articles, to get by. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Still, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places where we performed were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to control the excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by crowds. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of everything we needed. Even though I still felt shy, I also felt a strange confidence that only people who are usually shy can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, there has been a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians.
It is clear that more people will have access to music, which meets many human needs. Music is important for national events and for personal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.
I believe that people will continue to learn musical instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will be important for many jobs, especially in media. Also, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills in young people. Research in the USA shows that making music can improve spatial reasoning, which is a part of intelligence. While these results need more study, other research in Europe suggests that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children, especially those with behavior problems.
Current research is also looking at how playing an instrument can help develop useful skills. For example, regular practice can help with good study habits and focus, while playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of this, there will likely be a continued need for music lessons in the near future.
What about the future? Will there be changes, and what will they be? I think there are two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new styles mixing together. Second, technology will be used more in creating and performing music. This will make it easier for more people to compose music without needing a lot of technical skills, but it may also reduce the need for live performances.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities, reflecting their local musical traditions. If this future is to happen, the music profession needs to prepare. Music lessons will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means that music education will need to adapt to be relevant to a wider range of people and include more musical skills.
Training for musicians will also be important. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, and management for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 
This change can be a chance for everyone in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we need to raise awareness of the importance of music in our lives. Music is essential, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to make sure this changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This often happens when actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often use boring phrases or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when they perform. He believed that talking about acting makes it feel less real. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the story. After a play ends, they feel empty until they perform again. This emptiness is clear when people discuss acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet in a way that shows he is between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but strong. He controls his body and emotions well, showing both anger and humor. This makes his character both scary and lovable. You can see his talent in how he moves. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that also shows a strong inner feeling. 
So, what is acting? Is it just copying real behavior, or is it something deeper? This is a big question in theater.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director has a special way of rehearsing called ""dropping in."" During this process, the stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly while others speak, paying attention to the words. When it’s their turn, they look at the screen, think about the first line, and wait for the right moment to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might picture a memory, like waiting in line for a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen during the performance.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theater should make you feel important. Going to a live performance is special, and the staff should understand this. It feels strange if the workers act like it’s just a job. The theater should create a connection between the actors and the audience. People in the audience should feel close enough to hear and see everything happening on stage. The size of the theater is important too. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theater is too big, it feels wrong because drama is about people. Many theaters built in the late 1800s got this right because they made spaces that feel welcoming. 
When it comes to plays, you can’t please everyone. You can’t guess what the audience wants because they might not know themselves. When you go to the theater, you want to see something surprising and new, or else you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly popular with young people, but it also had a big effect on the middle class and older people. It opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to this new and exciting music, knowing it would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very important for many young rock stars. Like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to make his own music instead of just listening to others.
**Snow**
I could not see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I had to give up my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. There is still some mystery about how researchers do this. To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to talk about their methods. The goal was to share their experiences and understanding of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task is not easy, so we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn’t know much. 
Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. 
Research shows that learning happens best when there is conversation with teachers or parents. It is important to use new technology to teach our children, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people did not like this change and thought the new filmmakers were rude. However, in the end, they accepted that success was important. Success is measured by how much money a film makes. 
Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. A hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. 
Today, Hollywood is still a small community where everyone talks about films: how much money they made, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live somewhere else, but it is still the main place for anyone in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s who wanted to capture what they saw. They found a way to make lasting images using light, lenses, and special surfaces. These images were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which surprised other artists. 
At first, some art critics said photography could not be considered art because it was too connected to reality and used machines. But photographers believed they had created a new form of art. They used their tools to show their view of the world, just like other artists used brushes and pencils.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book needed illustrations. This was also true for many novels for older readers, but the number of illustrated books decreased over time. 
Children's publishing was mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality books. However, the best artists always tried to do their best work. The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both great and not-so-great work, making it a fascinating place for research and discovery. 
The best illustrations will likely be shown to the public again, either through new editions of classic books or exhibitions of original artwork. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, a creative publisher may release a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online messages that tell people where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects.
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience. We might think this will bring us wealth or fame, but we can also get lost in the chaos of sharing too much. It can feel overwhelming, but we should not lose hope. There is a path to follow, shown to us by early internet users who explored these dangers before us.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a blog where he wrote about his life and included photos and art. In January 1996, he began posting daily, and many people became interested in his adventures.
Hall was open about everything; he would write about any topic. While some might see this as attention-seeking, there was also a creative side to his work. However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video called ""Dark Night."" Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. He chose to remove the blog, but he felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company's vice presidents, including some she had made fun of. This led to her losing her job. 
Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and pretending they are separate can lead to serious mistakes. 
Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is successful as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps support her family. She learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired all the time. In richer and busier countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious have become common problems. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep issues. Some popular books in Britain even have characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. 
One important idea is that ""People need more sleep,"" says a sleep expert. When people are busy, they often sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. A sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they found they needed about eight hours of sleep. This shows they were catching up on sleep they missed.
In Europe, a university in the English Midlands has a sleep research lab that studies how tiredness affects different people, like sailors and drivers. They look for volunteers in student newspapers. These volunteers are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleeping habits.
Dr. Louise Reyner, a researcher, reassures volunteers who worry about having electrodes on their heads. She explains that they are not looking at dreams or thoughts, but studying physical effects. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator where volunteers drive while answering questions. They always come in the afternoon when they are naturally sleepy, especially if they had little or no sleep the night before.
During the test, one young man tries hard not to fall asleep. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more and nod off. Each time he wakes up, the car drifts off the road. Dr. Reyner says that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay awake and drive safely for a while. She suggests using energy drinks and other products to help stay alert, especially for shift workers.
Scientists know that humans sleep in cycles, just like other mammals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in light sleep, and during this time, the brain keeps the body still to prevent injuries. 
There are many theories about why we sleep. Some say sleep helps repair our bodies or rest the part of the brain that controls speech and creativity. However, it is not clear if this happens faster during sleep or when we are relaxed and awake. 
Researchers have found that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they do not know why. Some researchers even say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt.""
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British life from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited the most from this quiet time.
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people started to sleep in a more efficient way. The industrial revolution later changed sleep patterns for everyone, making people work longer hours in lighted buildings. 
However, in some non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They might sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then go back to sleep. In some tribal societies, noises from animals and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"We are talking about really big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots, which cost 800 dollars each, on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked out at the Arizona mountains and realized I did not belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy. But that feeling went away when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt and carrying a bag, and when he saw my new boots, he raised an eyebrow and walked away without saying anything.
I thought there should be some clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. It was my passion, but I couldn’t do it anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other options for when they stop racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they didn’t work out.
One idea was to be a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers who wanted that job. Another idea was to sell classic cars, but that didn’t go well either. It was a bad year for selling old cars, so I decided to stop before I lost everything. Being an ""ex"" at anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, people would only listen for a short time before getting bored. 
I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved some. But I really miss the excitement of racing. I miss the feeling of driving a powerful car that could go from zero to 150 miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. I miss the bright, interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous had its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me, and kids would sneak under fences to get my autograph.
Now that I don’t race anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, my phone rang twice, and I realized I had nothing to do in the mornings and afternoons. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I saw some little brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Some locals may complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, but it is clear that new residents and tourism have helped the city grow. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a gateway to many destinations.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write something for free, but I think it is more about how we try to make our writing perfect. In our work, we want to have the best effect, so writing a letter feels different. A true artist, who writes without thinking too much about the effect, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the power of words is what makes someone a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the sounds of the words made them powerful.
**Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A soap star, a DJ, or a member of the royal family would usually come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets are opening all the time, so celebrities are not needed anymore. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, older people waiting in line did not care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front. A customer said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud, while those who arrived late felt jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, there was a lot of excitement around it. However, it did not do well at the box office. The film became popular again later because of television. It is one of the most important films that has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from the fact that he did not know the rules of filmmaking, so he just made the film the way he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he worked very hard on it.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and that was the best place to do it. Carmel nodded but seemed like she didn’t really understand. Dermot asked her, ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" She smiled and replied, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it would be a bit wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it."" ""That’s fine,"" she said.
**Title Race**
""Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator."" 
Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a better job title that sounds more motivating or professional. If people care so much about titles that they would choose them over money, it shows a big problem. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator), but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how one picture could capture a moment in time, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph. As long as I had film in my camera, I could keep trying. I had a simple rule: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for new pictures.
Once, I took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular. Many newspapers and magazines wanted it. It was a brief moment of fame, mostly just luck. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which I thought was a smart choice. However, life had other plans, and things did not go as well as I had hoped. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I expected, even after my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it, which I thought was good.
My assignment in Vienna happened by chance. I had taken photos for a book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice payment for my work in London during different seasons. I had my own style, capturing the beauty of flowers in Hyde Park and the busy streets of Piccadilly. I knew that some of my best photos would not be used because it was just a picture book, not something meant to change people’s views.
After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great to me.
They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it had been a busy and hot trip, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in cold January, I felt it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snowy roofs, I knew I would enjoy my time there and take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to feel the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold, like the grand buildings from the old empire. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had done in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to discover it.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time and looked carefully. The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz look beautiful and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral. Its tall spire reached into the sky, but at the ground level, it was huge and heavy. I realized I might not be able to capture it all in one shot, but I could still find something magical in that moment.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even when you understand how it works, the mystery remains. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room, and that feeling stays with you forever. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art**
Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a wonderful place. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a unique exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition shows the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It highlights that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an important but often overlooked part of art in the twentieth century. 
The exhibition includes a variety of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for many years, has put these works together without too much text. This allows visitors to enjoy the art and make their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people, even those who usually do not care much about art. People might like his work because it is easy to understand or because it shows themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some people may even be more interested in Hockney's personality and humor than in his art. 
However, this does not mean that his art lacks purpose. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist, but others argue that his popularity does not mean his work is not valuable. Hockney himself knows his strengths and weaknesses. He does not claim to be a great artist and believes that only time will tell how important his work really is.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some great and some not so good. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a specific idea or theme among artists. Sometimes this works, but often it feels forced. Because of this, I decided to create a different kind of exhibition. 
With seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse for a show called ""Window-shopping."" This exhibition featured individual artworks that were connected only by the fact that they were all art. For example, Sam Cole created knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. In contrast, Matthew Crawley filmed a video of him breaking a camera. These artworks did not fit into a specific theme, but they worked well together. 
I did not make any big statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
Many people who enjoy paintings are sometimes afraid to analyze them because they think it will ruin their experience. Some art historians focus more on theory than on the enjoyment of art, which can take away from the pleasure of looking at art and the creativity involved in making it. 
This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how to cook a dish takes away from its taste. Understanding something better can actually make it more enjoyable. Enjoyment is complex and can be influenced by our senses and the society we live in. 
While it is important to appreciate art with our senses, the belief that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an old idea. Art can be both a feeling and a thought."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
In the Stone Age, people may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river and waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone. This stone felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been found by chance. Once people realized that copper could be used to make tools, they began to look for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which helped improve their lives.
**St Ives**  
We walked slowly down a narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center, struggling against strong winds and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark clouds above, visiting Cornwall without a car during the off-season did not seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is already gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced wars and droughts are no longer alive. We cannot know exactly why they moved or settled in certain places, as their stories have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling helps us recreate ancient landscapes and environments. We can create virtual communities that act like real people, with some of their needs and abilities. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change things like the amount of rain or the number of people and see how these virtual cultures respond."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male monkey saw a strange male nearby in another group of trees. The stranger wanted to join their group. If he did, the dominant male might lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made a clever plan. When the strange male tried to cross the open ground to join them, the dominant male made an alarm call that warned of a leopard nearby. The stranger quickly ran back to the trees. This happened many times throughout the day. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while walking across the open ground himself.
**What Cats Catch**
In a village in England called Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America calculated that this means cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year! However, this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide places for birds to nest. This helps keep the bird population higher than normal. The survey showed that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Every morning, the buffaloes, who sleep on a platform or near the fire with their owners, slowly leave to go to the distant reed beds. They stand at the edge of the platform, groaning about how tired they are, until the leader finally steps forward and enters the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds for many minutes. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they start swimming, looking like they are struggling to stay above water. They spend the day among the reeds, eating the green plants they can reach.
**Picasso, Pablo**
In early spring 1940, Picasso painted several pictures of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. Even though the fish are in trouble, they look alive. The painting is not easy to understand because Picasso used a flat pattern with overlapping shapes. The light paint and cool colors make it look calm and peaceful, like an underwater scene. However, there is a sense of danger as the fish show their teeth and the crab opens its claws. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling of tension and hidden violence."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many parts of human life. In this short time, photography has improved a lot, allowing us to see both big and small things. It has given us images from faraway places, different parts of space, and the complex issues of modern life. Photography is one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually is much older. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans made cave paintings. They might have shown real hunting events, been used for magic to help with hunting, served as religious symbols, or just been made to make life more colorful. These early images are closely connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what they mean in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record of reality. The camera worked like the human eye and was thought to create images that looked very much like what we see. The chemical process used in photography allowed for capturing natural moments.
At the same time, photography was seen as a sign of advanced culture. It produced images that artists had worked hard to create. Because photography seemed so real, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. In 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photo of the sky.
However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we need to think about how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the details that make them special? Photography is often seen as a strong form of evidence, making it easy to confuse our view of the world with its photographic images. For example, it is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""This is my grandson.""
Since photography was invented in 1839, the technology and how people view it have changed a lot. This change is partly because photography has moved from being just a record-keeper to something that tells history. Photographs now often show more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects in the images.
I want to show that the camera is not just a tool that records events. Photography can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to think about the cultural changes during the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed how people represented images. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture we have today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It is important to be creative, but making mistakes can lead to problems. I believe that for beginners, the best way to learn is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow. Some people need to feel safe in their lives before they can write a poem, while others write to escape their sadness. Some writers have a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All these methods are valid as long as they are not too strict.
Finding your own voice is key. You should listen to your inner thoughts and let them grow. With time, your voice will become strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it is important not to have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary. A memory from the main character can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action.
Dialogue is very useful in short stories. Conversations between characters can show different sides of a situation quickly, keeping the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but being brief does not mean you should only give a summary. The conflict and action in a short story should be just as strong as in a novel, but every word must count.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. Many chess players make mistakes, but they learn as they play. At first, they may only see a few moves ahead, but with practice, they start to understand the game better. They learn to see the whole game, not just individual moves, and they notice patterns in how the game is played.
Just like in chess, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand the details and complexities involved.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally learn to speak, as we see in young children. However, writing is not something we are born knowing how to do. Charles Darwin said that language is a natural human instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons, but writing systems have been created only a few times in history. Most children in the past did not learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle with it.
Children are good at listening and speaking, but learning to write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn so we can help them succeed."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I don’t have a big story to tell, and I don’t end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my readers wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don’t know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps and make it more complete, but I don’t want to do that. I just want to write down what I know.
To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names that I made up, and I have taken care to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that the way he lives and his unique character may influence others, and long after he is gone, people may realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a little about his early life may find something useful in this book.
I believe my book will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I never took notes, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same liberty that historians do. I have imagined speeches for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and interesting. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to do what I can to make it enjoyable. 
A smart reader will see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I think we can only really know those from our own country. People are shaped by where they were born, the homes they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. These experiences make them who they are, and you can only understand them if you have lived through similar things. 
Since you can only know people from a different country by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves the same way; they are seen through my own eyes, just like my main character."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, people may find the world of literature confusing. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important writers. Right now, there are many different styles of poetry, and many ways to write, present, and teach it. There are also different opinions about what a poet's role in society should be.
Today, there is a debate between two groups of poets. One group is made up of serious writers who want their poems to be read on the page. The other group includes popular poets who enjoy performing their work in front of an audience. This division is not strict, as many poets do both.
In the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common. Small literary groups hold readings in village halls or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students, and arts festivals often feature well-known poets.
These events have different effects on poets. For popular poets, performing is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily when heard once. However, for serious poets, their work may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing it for the first time. These poets aim to express deep feelings and thoughts in a small space, using varied rhythms. If they only read their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, they may not show their best poetry.
Listening to poetry readings is not a replacement for reading poems on the page, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing good poets read their work can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
One good reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes mixed with music, is that they help people enjoy poetry. This way, audiences can see poetry as something for everyone, not just for a few special people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this has some problems. It is not realistic to think that a person's story is a perfect reflection of their past. In an interview, both the interviewer and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about the past. The final result is affected by the historian's social position and how they understand the past. This means historians must take responsibility for creating new evidence. 
However, the informant also does not have direct access to the past. Their memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media. They might also feel nostalgic or have feelings of loss about their childhood, which can change their memories. The emotions and attitudes shared during the interview can make the story seem more convincing, but these feelings might come from later experiences, not the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural environment and what affects that behavior. 
Within the whole animal approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs and study learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural behaviors of animals in the wild. Although these two areas are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often believe their methods are more important. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not replace the need to study behavior itself. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. 
Since we all experience social life daily, it may seem that social sciences are just common sense. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on different aspects of social life, uses specific methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the foundation of the subject and help social scientists understand society better, distinguishing one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provided Greek terms for some of these ideas, which likely came from earlier Greek sources that we no longer have. 
Vitruvius did not include utility and function in his definition, but he later described the best designs for different types of buildings. At first, he emphasized the artistic side of architecture. The beginnings of classical architecture are complex. There was a long history of simple buildings in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Even though these early structures were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural designs. Despite how complex classical temples may seem, they are essentially simple, single-room structures."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled bad. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily to go for a drive. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, which was the quietest day. They planned to leave early in the morning and come back by noon so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Mui, even though she was worried, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. But Lily felt a bit insulted that Mui didn’t trust her to find the way.
After an hour of driving, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to agree. Lily even passed a couple of slow cars confidently, which made Chen clap his hands in approval. They drove through the gasworks of the seaside town, past the lagoon with small boats, and along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street near the sea, where there were many empty parking spaces. She wasn’t sure about the road signs, so she decided to pay for parking instead of risking a ticket. 
Lily noticed her sister’s worried face in the mirror while driving. She thought it was better not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don’t worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily told Chen he was ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee, their son, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers and one day own many restaurants.
As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a bit sad but happy at the same time while thinking about Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship shining in the sunlight. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he finally found it. It was a small, old, rusty ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special ship for us. It’s small and old, but it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the telescope stopped working. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I once read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket off the wall. As soon as it was free, I fell into the well. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I hit my head and saw strange lights. At first, I was confused, then scared, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say.
You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices coming from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. 
My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming, and my father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. I saw a little pool of water at my feet. My father was shining a flashlight into the well, looking for me. I couldn’t believe no one had seen the drops.
My mother was screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It scared me. What should I do? I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. I realized this was worse than I thought, and I might get in big trouble. I felt angry with myself for not thinking ahead. 
Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding, pretending to be weak. I called out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit and then fell on the stones. I sat up, feeling comforted in my mother’s arms. I took a deep breath and said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and I crawled through it to get out. 
I thought I was almost safe until my father came and asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. He looked at me closely. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me, so there was no point in looking for it. I told him the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped. When I looked into my father’s eyes, I felt scared. He seemed to see me in a new way, and I realized he didn’t believe me. 
“Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding very disappointed. He walked away. Arthur looked at me with concern, not because of my adventure, but because he could see through my lie. He worried about what kind of person I was becoming. His pity hurt me more than my father’s words. I understood that both my father and Arthur judged my actions, and it made me feel even worse."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan, who is now a widow, has to leave her family home because her children are grown up. She sees a van that says 'Removers of Distinction', and she watches as everything that makes her house special is taken away. Fred, the removal man, is carefully packing her belongings, while his helpers are not as gentle. 
Susan's house is beautiful, a tall building with a view of a small harbor. She remembers all the years she spent there with her children. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move, making sure she doesn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also there, being bossy and insisting that she will take care of the piano because it is very valuable.
Fred notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that many people do cry when they see their home being emptied. Susan can understand why. If she were alone, she would have told the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' job to notice it. The piano is now the last thing to be moved, sitting alone in the best room of the house.
Sitting on the stairs, Susan remembers the day they moved in. It feels like that day is playing in reverse. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for almost two hours to get it inside while little Robert watched, and Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it in, and her late husband, Peter, solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder took out a window, and they used a crane to lift the piano inside. The children were so happy to see it.
Now, many years later, Susan thinks about how her children are too busy to visit, and she finds it hard to move around the house. She worries about the piano and feels she should have told the movers about it. But it is too late now. Fred asks if she is okay, reminding her that the piano is the last thing to go. 
Robert and Francesca come to watch. Fred casually asks if there are no tears. Susan feels like she might cry. It is strange how moving things makes them feel important. Just then, the piano appears at the top of the stairs, and Fred carefully guides it down. 
As they bring the piano outside, Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together, relieved that the move is almost over. They lean on each other, laughing and gasping for breath. Fred asks what is so funny, but his question only makes them laugh more. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan realizes that the only tears she has are tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was that it should be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, you needed some technical skills to do this. But there was one area that really opened up to everyone: literary criticism. 
By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea. Each book had its own page, and when someone wrote a new review, it appeared right away. This helped Amazon fill its pages with free reviews, and people looking to buy books could see what other readers thought, not just what the publisher said or what professional critics wrote.
Other online bookstores also had similar features, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the online market. Because of this, it had the most customers and the most reviews, but it also faced some problems. Many reviews were submitted every day, and Amazon did not say how many. It was hard to check all of them. A team of editors looked at the reviews to make sure they followed the rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that gave away the ending or used bad language were also removed. However, reviewers could remain anonymous, and bad reviews were only taken down if Amazon noticed them. This meant there was a chance for some tricks.
For instance, there was nothing stopping authors from writing good reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some good ones himself. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments really came from the authors, except for famous writers.
The real excitement came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, was published, it received good reviews from the press. But many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and used Amazon to express their anger. Many negative reviews appeared but disappeared a few days later. Despite this, Amazon thought it was good for business that so many people were writing and reading reviews. 
Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. They paid special attention to bestselling books to make sure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired some funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to how the Internet works, saying it gave a good overview of networking. However, such silliness was rare. 
Most readers took their reviews seriously, and overall, the reviews on Amazon provided a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This is why making the review process open to everyone is a good thing."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people often think that artists must go against the art of their time. Art is praised for being unique, new, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. However, when we look at art today, we sometimes feel that an artist has gone too far and that their work is not really art anymore. The media often shares this opinion, and many of us agree because we expect art to always be new and different. This makes us overlook the old themes and methods that are still present in today’s art.
We expect artists to be different from us, with special talents that make them stand out. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and it was part of everyday life. Today, we let artists work on their own and sometimes get upset if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a text from an art book that talks about different kinds of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then says, ""There are many different kinds of pictures."" This sounds simple, but it leads to a more complicated situation. The artist asks someone to prepare a canvas and then asks a sign painter to write the chosen text on it in plain black letters. My important question is: is this finished piece a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is a rule that successful painters should stick to one style. Collectors want artists to keep creating similar work, and if they try something new, people often feel disappointed. Gallery owners prefer artists who are safe bets, and the art-buying public likes to see familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully tried new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different. He is moving away from the still lifes that made him famous to create paintings about the London Underground. He has been inspired by his drawings of Kings Cross Station and has now created an exhibition called Underground Encounters, which shows the unique beauty of this underground world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I call it an ""escape,"" but the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a lonely place to recover. I am here to heal myself. Besides an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories. I talked about the uselessness of art but did not mention how it can comfort us. The true value of art is that it allows us to change reality and show its deeper meaning. Our everyday actions often hide the true beauty of life. For artists, creating art helps us deal with the pain and challenges of life, allowing us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice with him, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already guessed what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. My father usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was about to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV.""
""Be that as it may,"" he said, trying to stay calm, ""I feel like your heart is not in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I could see many job options for me, and I wanted to explore them. But at the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the skills - the brains, the courage, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I had taken care of him since we were kids. It was not hard because I loved him. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, went to nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businessmen - and our house was always lively.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me a lot.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices, especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us.
So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, but only a couple of times a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important job for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my time.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could tell my father didn't understand how much pressure I was under, and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the job, I saw how determined he was, how clearly he worked, and how much energy he had. In his way, he was a genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. A house that requires careful budgeting is often not worth buying at all. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had been successful at work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency two months after having twins and received a raise to thirty-five thousand. She strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not argue much against her reasons: their flat was too small for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area of London, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt that living in Mornington Mansions was not good enough for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 
Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money. Since her office was on the other side of London, Simon had to take the tube. The crowded journey made him feel resentful and unhappy. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. He remembered the smell of dinner and how his grandmother took care of his grandfather after a long day at work. She was a supportive wife, always present at legal events, and seemed happy with her life. But that time was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and they both needed their jobs. Their lifestyle depended on both of their salaries. 
Now, their hard work could be ruined by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with anger. He wished he had left his room earlier to avoid the meeting. He remembered her accusations clearly. She said, ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he bribed three jurors. You did nothing. Is that true?"" Simon replied, ""He's lying. It isn't true."" She also accused him of accepting shares from Cartwright's company before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to him. 
He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering the fear of punishment from his school days. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief. He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him."" Instead, he had told a dangerous lie, and she knew it. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was unsure of what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t care about the worn-out rented houses and messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. 
It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window and sees me. She is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. She complains about how people always ask her about her writing. “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down,” she says. I don’t want her in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. 
“So, you’re on holiday now,” she says, sitting in the chair while I put a cushion on the ground. “I should’ve gone into teaching. Writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” I think about how some people can’t do either. “What are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel a wave of dread about the empty days ahead. 
“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. My heart races as I speak. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” she asks. “No, I’ll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were kids.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. 
“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?” Jaz asks about her story, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses. I decide to be honest for once. “Try writing about nice people for a change,” I suggest. “A little less focus on yourself and more on others.” 
“Teachers!” Jaz replies, acting like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say. My advice sounds old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,” she says. I do have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. 
When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen makes me feel better. Suddenly, I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She used to wink at us and say, “I’ve had my moments.” We all laughed."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, we also have a need to learn about our wider past to understand our future, both as individuals and as a nation. Heritage helps us feel a sense of continuity, which gives us comfort about our past and our future. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it feels good to belong to something bigger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences our customs and material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these oral traditions have been lost. Now, we often learn about our past through places and buildings. It is very important to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*. I did not know then that the landscape of a place in England called the Fens would be very important in my story. After the book was published, people asked me why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about this area. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed flat and empty, which provided a good background for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not really flat or empty. They are unique and strange, even though they are very much a part of England. It is surprising that there is a place in the middle of England that many people find unusual, especially since many other areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and they seem simple but are actually very mysterious. I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow yet. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than seek proof. However, trying to imagine the Fens is important because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant just putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Now, accessibility means more than that. Displays can be exciting and use creative techniques to attract visitors and create emotional responses. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and they have started to offer similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects, not copies. They exist to help people connect with authentic items that have historical meaning. This is their strength and what makes them different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that create engaging displays and outreach programs will find that their competition in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by increasing interest in real history, which museums can uniquely provide.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect many people. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of towns today and their future. People who have lived through major events, like world wars, may care more about preservation because stability is important to them. If there is a need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem different from everyday life. 
Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started the modern science of the 20th century. Scientists were trying to explain the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces relate to each other. Einstein made important contributions by looking closely at basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but can change depending on the situation.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won awards because we thought they would be boring. Our mother did not like our attitude, but our father would give us small coins for each chapter we read to encourage us to read better books. He would also give us some special books as gifts, marked with ""This Book is NOT Literature."" We thought most of his books were for boys, but he did help us read some good short stories and even a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, ""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous."" This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans who lived in dangerous places made desperate noises, and some words we use today, like ""malaria"" (meaning ""fever"") and the Latin word ""mors"" (meaning ""death""), come from these sounds.
Many people avoided talking about how language started because they thought it was silly, but now, studying the origin and evolution of language is very important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech mainly for friendly communication and to gain power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke believed when he said language was a way to share knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"**Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and strict limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only read for a short time, usually just a day or a week, and sometimes a month.
People often think that writing reviews is not very important. Many believe that writers only do it because they need money. Others think that writers cannot spend all their time on a serious book, so they write reviews instead. However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for an international journal. A 1,500-word piece in a weekly magazine has its own challenges, too.
Reviewers must think about their audience. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed analysis. Reviewers also need to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.
The American writer John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novel-writing. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in those reviews.
I feel this way about my own work. I mostly write academic books, which are the kind of things professors write as part of their jobs. In the English-speaking world, there is not a big difference between reviewing and studying literature. It is common for the same people to do both. The time when academics criticized professors for writing reviews is over. Now, there is so much reviewing that almost everyone can do it, and complaints about professors taking jobs from non-professors are less common.
I believe this is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them stay connected to the real world. They need to remember to explain their ideas clearly to non-professors. When they talk to each other, they might use complicated language, but they should communicate effectively with others.
In conclusion, reviewing is usually a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment. As he entered the dark hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership, which still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place where he could focus on himself. He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, looking either independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.
Over time, Ralph began to see his flat as a part of himself, a space where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He grew frustrated that it couldn’t change. There were always a few letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink with messages when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were intact and nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what it would be like if something bad happened.
From his small, dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a little more like himself on the bus ride home. He wanted to be alone, but he often felt lonely instead. At his desk, he craved time to himself, but when he finally escaped, he felt empty. He worried that his job, which he didn’t enjoy, was changing him and taking him away from who he really was.
As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he started to question why he did these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt lost. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself, but he realized that he mostly just wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work.
He went to one job interview and was grateful for the chance to talk with Neil, the boss. He didn’t think much about the job itself, just happy to have a nice conversation. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied. Ralph took this as a compliment, even if he didn’t fully understand what it meant at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was pushing my way through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was going towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It was not like a regular racecourse, but people were standing on both sides of a piece of land where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few special goats in line, which is not easy because goats are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could see the cliffs with the help of our flashlight, but the batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they didn’t work. We couldn’t find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of fast-moving water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. We kept going.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and important shareholders. How can I get better at presenting and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues what tough questions the audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and then gradually lead to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull on a tangled fishing line, the knot will just get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math. But other things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they may fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need the results"" is not helpful. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe. I only thought about it later. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also has to react quickly without thinking too much.
The second speed is regular thinking. This is when we figure things out, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic fixing a car or a student working on an assignment uses this kind of thinking. We often call this 'intellect'. People who are good at solving problems are seen as 'bright' or 'clever'.
The third speed is slower and more relaxed. This is when we think about things in a more playful or dreamy way. For example, when we sit by the sea and listen to the waves, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ones. Taking time to think slowly is necessary, especially when life gets busy. 
Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Recent studies show that a patient and relaxed mind is good for understanding complex situations. Fast thinking works well for simple problems, but when things are unclear, we need to take our time. For example, if we are unsure about how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change jobs, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This slower thinking is linked to creativity and wisdom. 
Poets and philosophers have long understood that slow thinking has its own value. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of knowing. They have found that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss and help us understand complex issues better than quick thinking can."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly and well-equipped place in a very isolated area. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. We all work together as a close community. My school French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversations. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a bit scared of mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to sit at, and I felt anxious when I spoke. I still smile awkwardly or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think this feeling of sadness sometimes comes from losing the confidence I had when I could talk easily with others.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. But then I became successful as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to be friendlier. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as I made more friends because of my success, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. What mattered to him was the photography and the sound. He believed that it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience, but the film itself, no matter where they came from. So, if a film is made well, people from Japan should react the same way as people from India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius who liked to see the audience react strongly. He did not focus on complicated ideas or deep meanings, and he did not explore his characters too much. He concentrated on making great films and the beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. Until about 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books about practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment that people can buy. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 
However, some things have also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities 50 years ago. During the day, the sky is often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and create clouds. This makes it hard to observe the sun and the night sky.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services can feel like an addiction. Technology makes everything change quickly, and there are always new goods and services available. Just when you get used to one product, another one comes out. This can be overwhelming and tiring, making people feel disconnected from life. 
Having more choices can lead to more stress, less time, and more confusion. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" – simple things that bring meaning to their lives in a complicated world. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many products available. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we really need, and many software updates and plans that are hard to keep track of.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. The guests at McAndrews Hotel are a bit old-fashioned and some might say snobbish. 
I do not like the bad manners of shop assistants today, which some people think is fair. I also dislike when waiters act too friendly, as if they want to be too familiar. I know the names of many other guests because they have been coming here since they were children, just like me. When I see them in the hotel, we usually just say hello and do not talk much. This respect for privacy and dignity is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. I want to apologize for a bad review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the main role, and I was wrong about his acting. I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important, but I take back my words about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The whole cast is excellent. Some memorable scenes include when Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional and can make anyone cry. The pace and tension in the play are fantastic. Don’t miss this production!
**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the center, on the great white plateau, there is no life. However, there is a huge hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are very excited to explore this mysterious lake and find out what strange life forms might be there. For two years, researchers from around the world have been trying to discover the secrets of the lake. If they succeed, we will see many new discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what makes them want to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that scientists want to gain knowledge and understand everything from tiny atoms to huge black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this. I think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about why we want to know things. The key point is that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**  
Food is very important in our lives. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Sometimes, we think cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes, but that is not true. You can make a tasty soup by simply putting chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and some herbs in water. This is much better than buying soup in a packet or a can. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse full of chemicals, you can make a delicious dessert in just five minutes that both adults and kids will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important to us, which is why we celebrate special events like birthdays and anniversaries around a table. No one would want to have takeout for a wedding or discuss business over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were sticking out of drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and journals were close to new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very strict about time and cleanliness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in after her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and seemed to say she would not go in there. She thought he was someone from a different place, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her. The doctor later told her that the club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles, she felt grateful and knew she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly back to her work across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about something she had just seen. It is always thrilling to be the first to know important news, especially in a small town where life can be quiet. However, she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated how he cared for her when she had laryngitis, which was her only health problem. Miss Fogerty thought his best quality was that he always made patients feel like he had plenty of time for them and really wanted to listen to their worries. This is why the villagers loved him so much. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received their loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She performs a lot, but she has also started writing books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna's performances are exciting and impressive. She plays many different styles of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. At one concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised her, but she found it funny. She realized that the boy thought she needed to play that song to be a real pianist. 
Joanna cares a lot about how children learn music. She has just published a beginner piano book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She wrote this book even though she has a very busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and working with young composers. She also runs her own music label called Sound Circus. Joanna loves to work with other artists and often suggests new projects.
Many people are surprised that she decided to write a book. Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. She thinks that most people enjoy music in a simple way, not just as future stars. She wants to help everyone learn to play the piano, just like how everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French. 
Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and sometimes give up. This can happen for many reasons. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to be like the talented kids they see on TV. Joanna worries that some parents push their children too much, making them feel they must achieve high goals instead of just enjoying music.
When asked if she thinks other piano books are not good, Joanna is careful with her words. She believes her books are fun and colorful, but they are not the only ones that help beginners. She includes stories in her books and CDs to make learning more interesting. She wants children to have fun while they learn. 
Joanna encourages kids to try different things on the piano, like playing on the black keys and using the pedals. As they learn, they need to practice reading music, which can be hard. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. She believes that practice is very important. 
To help children practice, Joanna suggests they set goals for what they want to achieve. She also advises them to enjoy playing, even if they make mistakes. Mixing easy pieces with harder ones can also help. For Joanna, practicing is a big part of her life, and she wants to share her love for music with everyone."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I see that I made very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is physically hard. Writing slowly helps the brain think better. When we write by hand, we take more care. But using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend just as much time fixing mistakes in their computer drafts as they did writing by hand. 
Also, emails feel different from handwritten letters. Emails are often less personal. Many people now write love letters through email, which is a good thing. At least these emails are written in English and have some grammar. However, words on a screen can feel boring. Writers often do not understand the power of writing and can exaggerate their messages. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not very nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed him the disc. ""It's amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it again. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thought for a moment. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He pointed to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have thought they were amazing. Many people say that electronic text is a big change, like the invention of printing. But they forget that changes in how we think take a long time. Some people think their generation is the most important in history. 
In a book from 1979, it was said that in the 1980s, books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often not enjoyable, so many people do not do it. Computers make it easy to read only parts of texts. Some people say this is a good thing because it leads to new ways of telling stories. But many books have always been read in parts, like religious texts and poetry collections. The real problem is that computers do not encourage us to read everything from start to finish.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything was in order. The carpet was clean, and the dark wooden desk looked just like it did at the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were in their drawers, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work.""
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any machines in the room. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had talked about this many times over the two years he had known her. She could not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. She could use software to create new things that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She often forgot things because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being an important advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being someone who was always rushing to fix problems and had trouble finding a parking spot at work.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label on the folder said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not like the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by asking him to write books. Ian was known for being unpredictable, and Lancelot felt that he was becoming even more difficult to deal with.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. At this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that people said Ian had, and it felt like he had lost his passion for writing. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published after he died, but he had only written it chapter by chapter, getting paid little by little. In Ian's case, he had received a huge advance, which was against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript to get paid later.
Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends wanted to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. For some reason, Ian's creative talent stayed hidden. While others became successful, Ian became more reclusive. Even when he was a well-known editor for an arts magazine, he struggled to produce anything. The magazine used up a lot of money without being published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but it only created stories about how much he was paid, which kept increasing to try to make him work more.
At meetings, Ian often criticized other people's ideas. Ten years later, he was so unreliable that Lancelot thought ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is a relatively new meal in England. In medieval times, breakfast was not often mentioned in literature. There are some mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers say this change happened because food became easier to get. However, they may not have thought about other important social changes. For example, new job patterns meant that more people had to work set hours, often starting very early. Because of this, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the rich."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For example, a person reading a newspaper may think they understand the photos printed there. However, instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we can ask if it truly shows what happened at that moment. Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photo as a symbol of a bigger issue in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes believe in themselves completely. To succeed in sports, you need to focus only on that goal. It is a tough world, and no one will do the work for you. You either succeed or fail. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve things on your own, but you should always remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. However, you also have to give up a lot to enjoy these benefits.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened many years ago in California. One night, I was awake listening to a beautiful mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a beautiful musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I thought about my experiences with jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying a stunning live performance. I reacted with joy as I listened to its surprising musical changes until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always had strong feelings about birds. They love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Some people think wrens are special birds that bring messages from another world. Others might just see it as a bird that is stuck. Both ideas could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, you can still see images of wrens in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about them are not as strong now, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels sad and empty. 
This connection with birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way to understand the importance of different animals. However, these beliefs can change over time. 
For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a valuable part of city life in London. People were amazed to see them flying down to take bread from children. But soon, they were seen as pests and disappeared from many areas. Now, red kites are protected again and are symbols of conservation in Britain. 
Our connection with birds goes back to the beginning of human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn them about danger or bad weather. Birds also connected them to their dreams. 
Birds are important to us because they represent freedom and beauty. Some people think our feelings for birds are old and not needed anymore. But these feelings are still part of who we are, and losing them would be hard. 
Recently, birds have become important indicators of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered. This is sad not only because we might lose these birds but also because it means losing part of our culture. 
Certain birds, like the skylark and turtle dove, represent love and magic in stories and poems. Many people feel sad about losing these birds because they are part of our literature and folklore. However, we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not mentioned in stories. 
Folklore is very important. The stories and legends about birds connect us to our past in a way that scientific facts cannot. These stories help us feel emotions that are often hidden in our busy lives. 
Whether we watch birds on TV or in our backyards, the joy we feel from them is hard to explain with science. Birds engage us in ways we don’t fully understand. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a rich history, reminding us of the mysteries of life."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different places and features on the earth. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, like saying ""it takes so many hours to walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring was more about how easy it was to travel through the land than about the actual distance.
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not show true directions. In the beginning, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs that varied in size to show their importance.
Different maps have different styles based on their purpose and location. To understand early maps, it is important to know the style used. The history of map-making, or cartography, shows how the accuracy of distance and direction has improved over time. Other sciences have helped in this process. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people started using the magnetic compass and other tools to measure angles accurately.
As explorers learned more about the world, they tried to create better maps. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which helped improve large area maps. The needs of map users changed too. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps anymore. Soldiers needed accurate maps for military purposes, especially after the invention of artillery. This led to the creation of contour maps, which show the shape of the land.
Later, archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps for their work. Today, cartographers create maps for many different topics, like geology, climate, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many sciences has led to a new interest in cartography.
It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times of slow progress and times of quick change. Old ideas sometimes stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers have often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Since it is easy to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas.
Therefore, we should not blindly trust maps as proof of current knowledge and techniques. The many maps we have today are the result of a lot of human effort and thought. They are valuable records for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography interesting and important."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a nice and calm place compared to the messy rooms where his family members spent time. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and it was surprising to see a teenager who had bought expensive wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had a scholarship to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford, and he had nine months before starting school. During this time, he wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.
I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for good reasons like women, money, and fame. But my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, after just ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own songs, and I could tell he was very talented.
As he played more songs from the shows he had created at school, I remembered some of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist, and I didn’t have much to show him except for my praise for his music and a single I had written that had not helped an unknown pop group’s career. We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I knew I had met someone special who would likely succeed in musical theater soon.
The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I felt about working with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs, but it seemed likely I would finish my exams and become a lawyer by twenty-five. My father thought I would stop enjoying pop music by twenty-one, which worried me because that meant I only had a few months left to enjoy it. But I thought it would be fun to see Andrew again, go to a musical with him, and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and old buildings, and he supported a football team.
I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but I knew he was very talented and had good connections. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man from the 19th century who started orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t excite me much. The main character seemed too perfect, and the idea felt similar to another famous show, Oliver.
However, Andrew was very confident about his music, and I started to feel excited too. I didn’t know much about musicals, but I remembered someone saying that if one hamburger place is popular, there is room for another. So, we could be the second hamburger place. I began to work hard, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the story, played me the music, and often gave me the song titles, which were probably thought up by his friend from school.
I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first lyrics for the musical. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that day marked the start of my new career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
You and I are part of a species that can communicate with each other very well. Language is so important in our lives that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders do not need to learn from someone else to spin webs; they just do it naturally.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, which are created by the air around us, greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. Climate can change how landscapes look. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which have many different types of plants and animals. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. The daily weather changes that create the climate happen because of large air movements. The air is always moving because the Earth is spinning. The air does not move as fast as the Earth, so it lags behind. The sun also causes a lot of air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on how good its coffee is. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, including how to clean and take care of the espresso machine. I also learned how to make a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might have to go back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often have problems with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are great subjects for the camera because it can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. 
A good example of this is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*, which has eight parts. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he has almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on famous artworks, but instead, it looked at how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this business. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. 
However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of rare metals high have found that the opposite is true. More minerals are being mined, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something special. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent a boat if you want to go at your own pace. 
Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reasons. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. You can find treasures not only in the sea but also at night when the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
You can build your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. When you join a course, you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend of bike-building.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes. I went to see what was happening. There was a lot of energy and fun in the workshop. Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes again. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. However, many cyclists find these bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost around $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to create a bamboo bike business that everyone could afford. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to develop their idea. They wanted to share the joy of making something special and sustainable. So, the Bamboo Bike Club became more about community than just a business. Both James and Ian have full-time jobs; James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. 
They offer monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a good price. On the first day, they teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You start by gluing the bamboo tubes together to form the bike frame. They also use metal tubes for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. 
James and Ian help everyone with their work, checking every cut and joint. If someone has trouble, they step in to help. Many people in the course are engineers, but Ian says everyone makes mistakes sometimes. If you mess up, just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece of bamboo is checked for quality, so you can choose how your bike will look: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and a seat. James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal bikes. Ian has been riding his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
James says their bikes are made to be very strong, using thicker tubes and bindings. However, bamboo bikes may not look as polished as metal bikes. The hemp wrapping can look a bit like tape. But James and Ian believe that the unique look of bamboo bikes is part of their charm. 
I think bamboo bikes are great for relaxed rides rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth ride. When I tried James's bike, it felt light and smooth, thanks to bamboo's ability to absorb bumps. James says the best part of the workshop is riding the bike after building it. They are light and fun to ride. 
And the best part? The price is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the title was great and believed it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray became very successful, and Dione started her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand each other better in relationships and is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry tries to meet people's desires to improve their lives, but it also creates new desires and supports the publishing world in New York. 
In Britain, people are discovering that many self-help books are not very good, but many more are rejected because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are now looking for the next big hit, and they focus more on how marketable a book is rather than the writing style. Dione Reverend says that if someone has a catchy title, it makes it easier to attract readers.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an unspoken agreement that they will tell the truth. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too embarrassing or not important enough. Sometimes, they might even create stories that are not completely true but express their feelings better than the facts. They might call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe it is true, even if it is mostly fiction. This can happen without any bad intentions.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
People who study detective stories say that this genre grew because of the problems in society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A detective story often shows a crime that represents human feelings like greed or desire. Solving the crime usually brings the person back into society, making everything work well again. 
In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and are somewhat comfortable together. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. He is both a criminal and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels guilty about his role, and this can make him more determined to catch the criminal.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best science writers today. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said he couldn’t write well in such a fancy place. He believes that knowing the culture is very important for a writer. Science is its own world, and only scientists can explain it well. If you don’t understand the science community, you will struggle to write about it.
Gould has a rule: never write down to your readers. He says you can make the language easier to understand, but you should never make the ideas simpler. If readers feel like they are being treated like children, they will stop paying attention to your writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, it feels very cold inside. To handle the high summer temperatures, the gym has turned the air-conditioning up too much. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic! This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It is now a common part of our lives, showing how we try to control the climate. However, many buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can really help and would reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, more people are interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by using the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. People needed them to make sure their clocks were correct. But as clocks and watches got better, sundials became just decorations in gardens. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago. There, I saw serious-looking older women painting delicate flowers on teacups with great skill. It was amazing to watch because each brushstroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners be good at it? When I attended a class, I found out it was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price. They had a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, a beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that the other people in their package were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian.
But something went wrong. At the travel agency, the check-in desk, or maybe in a computer, a mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane.
They ordered drinks on the flight. When they landed, a heavy woman with glasses told them to stay together. The brochure did not mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and they were tired, so they did not question the beds they were given. 
The next morning, they found out they were supposed to stay in the hotel for their whole holiday, and they became worried. The receptionist smiled and said, ""We have the lake and the water birds. You can take a boat to Interlaken."" 
Keith calmly told the receptionist, ""There has been a mistake. We were meant to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" The receptionist replied, ""I do not know that name. This is Switzerland."" 
""A coach is supposed to take us on,"" Keith insisted. ""An official said so on the plane."" The receptionist said, ""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you want to change, it will be difficult."" 
Dawne added, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 
A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, approached them. She smiled and said, ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" Dawne asked, ""Are you in charge? We are in the wrong hotel."" 
Keith explained, ""We got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl."" Dawne added, ""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover."" 
Mrs. Franks explained that there are many different holidays offered by Your-Kind-of-Holiday, and all tickets look similar. She laughed and said, ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 
Keith insisted, ""We are not supposed to be in Switzerland."" Mrs. Franks then walked away, leaving them standing there. 
The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. Dawne whispered, ""She seems kind."" But Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane. 
An elderly man interrupted his thoughts, saying, ""Nice to have some young people here."" He and his wife, both in their eighties, said they had the best sleep in years because of the lakeside air. 
""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the hotel, and Dawne followed him. They did not say anything about the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they found themselves on a package tour with older people when they wanted to escape from the needs of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is not entirely true. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many books and stories about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being published, and the American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about his life.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with great respect and find lessons in his leadership and communication skills. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during business mergers and crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the factory exploded"" or ""we have to lay off half the workers."" While it may seem hard to connect Shackleton's survival skills in extreme cold to handling a business crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership qualities. Shackleton knew what was important and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, including their lives.
One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his commitment to his men's safety. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months and was eventually crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" 
From the diaries of the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. He thought carefully, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and ready to change plans if something was not working. MacGregor says they have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's story that clients can relate to without feeling criticized.
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical strength, and patience. MacGregor notes that one of the hardest things to do in tough situations is to wait, especially in America, where people often want quick solutions. For example, if you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it is better to wait and get your money back than to sell and take a big loss. Also, if a new product is not selling well, don’t be afraid to change your plans.
Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were starving on an earlier expedition, saying he would leave it in the snow because it was so valuable.
As Caroline Alexander, the author of ""Endurance,"" says: ""People are increasingly interested in heroic efforts. Shackleton shows that there is not much heroism today. He stands out as a true example of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,C1,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. This primate has a way of finding food that is similar to how a woodpecker does. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists first learned about the aye-aye's unique way of eating over a hundred years ago, but they have only recently discovered how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied three aye-ayes: two males named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects just by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered.
Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with small holes. Some holes led to food, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the logs with food, showing that they did not need to see the holes to find it. They might have been using their sense of smell or hearing, but more tests showed that they did not rely on these senses either. Even when the smell of the insects was blocked, the aye-ayes still found the food.
So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they could sense the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long middle finger and listens carefully. Dr. Erickson thinks that the aye-aye is using a method called echo-location, where it listens for sounds that tell it there is a hollow space below. It can also hear insects moving when they are disturbed.
Some scientists believe that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar, but there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood. So, the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,C1,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Many of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? Sometimes, diaries give us a little information, but family stories are often not complete. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down, but we never seem to do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but videos are still just images.
Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary lives. Hannah got this idea after talking to her family and realizing that much of the past was being forgotten.
""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who really wanted to share their interesting lives. They often say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they enjoy it too.""
People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I was surprised by what I shared. There were painful things, like my divorce."" He wrote his story for his family, but he hasn’t let his children read it yet because he thinks some details might hurt them. He wants them to read it only after he is gone.
Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their parents. ""It’s amazing how much childhood experiences affect people for their whole lives,"" she says. People often repeat the same patterns in their lives, like marrying someone their parents liked or choosing a partner to rebel against their parents.
Many people have regrets about their past. Even after many years, they still feel hurt by things that were never resolved with their parents. They often try to impress parents who were never impressed. Some people even want to say, ""I can’t stand my mother.""
Hannah listens more than she asks questions. ""I’m not here to judge or be nosy,"" she explains. Sometimes, people share something and then worry if it should be included. She tells them they can remove things later, but most people want to be honest.
This is not just for people who want to show off their lives. Hannah believes that as life moves quickly, we are losing touch with our past. Writing these stories helps people connect with their roots and remember their ancestors. 
Each book takes about 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to write the life story. She organizes the material and writes it well. The final book looks good and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. Hannah gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the high cost stops many people from buying.
""I thought more people would want this service,"" she says. ""But the clients I have are often from wealthy backgrounds, the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted in the past."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of copies of Greek and Roman sculptures in the world, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to know that none of the sculptures are real. All the sculptures are exact copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a specially built gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are many: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, from Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original cabinets from the early 18th century. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and took care of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his life, he greatly increased the collections, creating a truly amazing museum. The collection is organized by geological age, so you can see how life on Earth has changed over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern uses.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection, taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs all over Great Britain. The photographs are interesting because they show a detailed record of the landscape, showing both nature and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the helpful library staff can answer your questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but you can usually buy copies. These are made to order and usually take about a month.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world. It is one of the most unusual tourist attractions in the area. You can have fun creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, called facsimiles, to protect the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. The brass plates were a way to remember the tomb statues and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and you can see the widest range at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have been lucky to spend 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding my baby, which is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in using physical violence. I have sometimes slapped my children when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am available if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me first. I do not want to make them feel guilty for not contacting me, as my parents did to me.
**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, around 25 years old, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected to my work. I missed some important moments when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on holidays to the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with my friends and attending parties and award ceremonies with us. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting and glamorous.
**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to start my political career. My wife and I promised to make time for our children, but as I became more involved in politics, it became harder to find time. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they do not feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their children to work, which shows that we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our kids in our lives.
**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about being a father. I worked hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently said that I was too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, being a parent never ends.
**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but just one smile from her makes everything better. A baby's smile is the best way to feel happy again."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science Flying in the Face of Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The aircraft looked like a normal plane from the outside. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.
For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was offered by the European Space Agency. They had to suggest creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which was like the most exciting roller-coaster ride ever.
For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, going up high before falling back down. The pilot would turn off the engines at 3,000 meters, and the plane would go even higher because of its speed. Then, gravity would pull it back down. During the few seconds between going up and coming down, everything inside the plane would be weightless, and the students would feel like they were closer to the moon than to Earth.
The flight started smoothly, but that changed quickly when the pilot made the plane climb at a steep angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and we felt the blood rush from our heads as we were pushed against the cabin floor. Then, the engines stopped, and we suddenly felt weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One small step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We floated around, and directions like left or right didn’t make sense anymore.
After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned, but not as quickly as it had disappeared, and some students landed hard. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of ""space time"" for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to test this, and one student managed to turn it over using a remote control. 
Another student accidentally landed on it during a rough return to gravity. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints are affected by weightlessness, which could help build future space stations. A team from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films that harden in sunlight. They believe that if they perfect this process, satellites could use solar sails like yachts use wind.
After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt strange, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would stay with us for a long time. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.
I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I experienced nine winters in a row, which I enjoyed because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.
I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I think my family became enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.
In New Zealand in 1968, it was a very rainy winter. It rained almost every day while we were planting. I remember being very wet and cold for a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready to plant again. I would come out of the Land Rover, still warm and dry, but then the rain would start, and I would have to deal with wet clothes and slippery shoelaces. My mind would start to think about many different things in life.
In that first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which helped me a lot because I had never planted trees seriously before. I wore a planting bag around my neck to carry as many trees as I could. When the bag was full, it was heavy, but it got easier as I planted more trees. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. We had to decide how far apart to plant the trees and set up three poles to guide us. Once we were in line, we could plant all the way down and then come back.
I enjoy hard physical work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, planting trees became almost automatic. I learned a rhythm and used the least number of movements to dig the holes. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You train your body to do the same actions, and then it becomes easy: take a tree from the bag, dig a hole, put it in, stamp it down, and move on. 
Mentally, it was interesting. My mind started to think about many things, including nature and our place in it. These thoughts have influenced my life a lot. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.
I should also mention that I took a break from teaching and went back to New Zealand in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place where I feel closest to the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Bringing Up Badgers**
""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset, where we care for orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was strange to me. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between mid-January and mid-March and live underground. If they are orphaned, they usually die from hunger. These three were found by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while working. Their mother was dead, but the cubs were still healthy, though cold and whimpering. 
After removing fleas from them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them near the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth first to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around, even if it was a bit shaky. They were happy together and had a heated pad to keep them warm.
Three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, but he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection. When feeding animals with a bottle, it is important not to let them drink too fast, as it can cause problems. In Willow's case, this led to an infection that was hard to treat because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two cubs. 
Then, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew the mother would not return, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. He was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon found out that he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but had trouble eating without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to eat.
At nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds for dinner. Normally, badgers eat mostly earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and some plants. My badgers were better off than others that year because it was very hot, and finding earthworms was hard. By August, my badgers started to be active at night and would go for walks at dusk. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would chase each other and play. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek sometimes got caught and ended up with bruises.
During these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food because their own areas were disturbed. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive, so we had to protect our cubs. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help us build a home for them on the farm. With advice from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels and a badger gate. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside.
As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Soon, they were more interested in the tunnels than going out. The building cost more than we expected, but a local bus company helped fund it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I checked on them and saw three badgers curled up and sleeping.
Now, I don’t walk with them as often because they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only sometimes because she has joined another sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before running off into the night. This is their territory now, and they have made it their home."
CAE_67,C1,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his biggest achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" show the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley was one of only two people in England at that time who were paid to do scientific research. He set out for the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic, but had to turn back because of problems with his crew. He later made another voyage that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From this journey, Halley published a map in 1701 showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map helped sailors for over a hundred years until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.
Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley had an amazing life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led many expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""
During this time, Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica, which is important in physics. Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. They will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.
Dr. Clark explains, ""We usually measure the strength of the magnetic field, but not its direction. To measure direction, we need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will help fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.
Halley's journey was very important. It was the first scientific expedition at sea, and Halley was the first civilian to be appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. 
Does Dr. Clark have what it takes to make his journey successful? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
Does he share Halley's passion? ""I am ready to give up eight months of my life for this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn’t want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his incredible life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,C1,"**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior has puzzled scientists for a long time, including Charles Darwin. He wondered how birds could develop such extravagant features in a world where survival is tough. 
Darwin believed that living things change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that the strongest and best-adapted individuals survive and have babies. However, he found it hard to explain why peacocks have such large tails, which can be a disadvantage. So, he introduced the idea of ""sexual selection,"" suggesting that females choose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens liked the most beautiful peacocks, it meant that these males had some hidden qualities that helped them survive. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it was a sign of something important.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to understand this behavior. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people, making them easier to study. Marion Petrie and her team have two main questions: Do peahens really prefer the males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have other advantages, or is it just about looks?
The researchers have observed the peacocks and found that hens do seem to prefer the males with the most eye spots on their tails. These eye spots are linked to the tail's length, and the peacocks with the most eye spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways.
William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and have fewer parasites. This idea has been supported in other bird species, but Petrie and her team have not yet been able to check the health of the peacocks at Whipsnade.
This year, Petrie is studying the offspring of attractive and unattractive peacocks to see if the children of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose mates for practical reasons.
There is also an interesting theory from the mathematician R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will prefer long tails. This could lead to a situation where males with the longest tails have the most mates, creating a cycle that makes the tail even longer over generations. This idea could also support Darwin's view that females might eventually choose mates just for their beauty."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He showed this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with the latest technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although she was designed last year, she looks like she is 100 years old. You might think her owner is a romantic person. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.
My boat uses the best parts of traditional boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, even though technology is important for designing and building boats, it often keeps sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what sailors want to experience when they go to sea. I don’t think sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if everything is done for you? Dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.
Why should we change the steering position from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot in the middle? This change makes the cabin feel like a big ship, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said she had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over time, I learned how true this was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, and no electronics for navigation, but she was the easiest boat I ever sailed.
However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I realized I could not keep her anymore. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing good, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, use computer programs, Irens first sketched the boat on a paper napkin and then moved his ideas to the computer. After creating a model, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.
The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and has a peaceful atmosphere inside, made from reclaimed pitch pine. This might be because she was designed only as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. This is a traditional way of designing boats. In her calmness, she shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it’s good to learn from the past. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. So, she has the advantages of a fiberglass boat but still looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa services are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started taking classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors were very skilled. I was surprised at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, made me feel like a new person. The staff in the treatment rooms were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and excitement. Henlow is planning to make big improvements this year, including a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a quiet walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling great and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I will definitely visit again. This is a perfect getaway for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I walked up the big staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, which includes an examination and checking weight and blood pressure. They called us patients, which felt strange because I am healthy. However, I was impressed that they quickly helped with a shoulder problem I had. Each person gets a special diet to follow. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry and got a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You get a massage or water therapy every other day. Extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm, but it is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a big lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after enjoying the food. There is also a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, but also relaxed. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.  
*Beverly D'Silva*
**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens in the 376-acre estate. Waldo's is a famous restaurant with amazing dishes. It took me a long time to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent some time in the gym to burn off a few calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. I thought about all the other journalists who would write about fitness and beauty treatments. Cliveden has everything you need if you want to stay fit before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever had. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which is a lot if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage. I had the best sleep in years. The place is modern and well-organized, with great facilities and comfortable rooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer many treatments, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to mothers and daughters. I would love to take a break here every month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the last seven million years, since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not changed much. Genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very recent. Our ability to create art and other things we think are unique to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. 
Recent studies of animal behavior show that many traits once thought to be only human are now seen as differences in degree. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. This means that besides art, there are not many clear differences between humans and animals.
If human art comes from a special genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost seven million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
If we believe that our recent creativity makes us different, we need to think about how our art is different from animal art. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is made for enjoyment, and it is learned rather than instinctive.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas, this is not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, on the other hand, helps birds defend their territory or attract a mate, which does help them pass on their genes. So, by this idea, human art does seem different.
The second claim is that human art is motivated by enjoyment. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during the breeding season, which suggests they are not singing just for fun. Again, this makes human art seem unique.
The third difference is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris. People can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' song, even if they have never heard it before.
Human art styles change quickly. For example, Roman writers described geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. But human art changes so fast that even a casual museum visitor can tell a twentieth-century painting from an older one, like the Mona Lisa.
Interestingly, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy created paintings that some people might mistake for human art. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and seemed to enjoy it. They even had an art show in London in 1957, and many of their paintings sold. 
These chimpanzee paintings challenge the idea that human art is very different from animal activities. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not made for practical reasons; they were created for the enjoyment of the painter. Some might argue that human art is different because it is meant to communicate, while the chimps did not care about sharing their art. However, some famous human art was also made for personal satisfaction, not for communication."
CAE_39,C1,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and narrow eyes, looking into the unknown. Today, we don’t see such people in stories or in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a group across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. The team he led included four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have put everyone in danger and made the trip very difficult.
This mixed group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's toughest desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who I was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will wonder why he used the word ""kind."" The team faced many hardships: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn’t experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us. That doesn’t mean we didn’t have challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often fell over onto us.""
""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was hard at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have gone through so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite being tired. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""
In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How did he feel about what they must have gone through? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to do that together. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I have done. But when I think about my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. Compared to that, the desert does not measure up.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We felt a strong sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,C1,"Life Without Gadgets**
Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful devices that make life easier. However, Susan feels that we have become too dependent on technology. She had a bad experience with a broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix. This made her think that gadgets are often not worth the trouble.
Susan started to stop using some of her household gadgets as they broke down. She questions what ""time"" technology really gives us. Does it just allow us to do more things that need even more gadgets? She feels that marketing tricks us into thinking we need these devices.
When her broken gadget made strange noises, she decided to leave it outside. Now, she enjoys taking her time with her sewing. She feels free from noisy machines and can carry her sewing supplies anywhere. While she appreciates some gadgets, like her washing machine, she has found joy in living without others. 
For example, she returned her rented color television and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped her family spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. Susan has taken up sewing by hand since her old sewing machine is now just a table for plants. 
She realizes that we often think we cannot live without our gadgets, but she enjoys the simple pleasure of sewing while listening to the radio or talking with family. She can even watch TV while doing simple sewing tasks, which makes her feel less guilty about watching. 
Sewing by hand is not boring for her; it is relaxing and satisfying. She finds that she can complete tasks quickly and at her own pace. This new way of living helps her avoid the rush of modern life. She also enjoys washing dishes while daydreaming.
Now, Susan looks around her home and wonders if she really needs all her gadgets, like the freezer or microwave. She thinks they might be wasting money and considers living without them."
CAE_62,C1,"The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst**
Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he seems to be in a hurry. He greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is hard to tell if he is really busy or just acting tough. 
His workshop is under a railway arch and is filled with unfinished furniture and pieces of wood in many colors. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a great reputation. He always has many orders, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, or bookcase, Hurst is the right person to ask.
Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes high-quality furniture is more difficult. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people just call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He does not like cheap, mass-produced items and believes that many people accept poor quality.
Hurst's desire for perfection is a big part of his success. He is confident in his skills and says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned his craft by asking questions and teaching himself. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some come back to him many times. He enjoys doing complete projects for their homes.
However, he admits that working with clients can be challenging. He finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want. He prefers clients who are clear about their needs. Hurst is proud of his work but also respects other craftsmen. He says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people.""
He criticizes those who take too long to make furniture or try to make it look like art. He believes furniture should be practical and useful, not just a fashion statement. Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"**Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.
The first and most popular theory says that sleep is important for our bodies. It suggests that we sleep to keep our bodies healthy. While we sleep, our bodies repair any damage from the day and get ready to work well again.
The second theory focuses on learning. It says that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, we would not be able to learn properly.
The third theory is about energy. It claims that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery. This helps us have enough energy for the next day."

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is different from what is normal in society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits or interests. For example, someone might love entering newspaper competitions, collect beer mats, or write letters to the press about many topics. Being eccentric shows our individuality.
Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces. One is called individualism, which is the desire to be unique, and the other is conformity, which is the desire to fit in. Most people want to be accepted and liked, so they often choose to conform rather than stand out. 
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as strange. Being part of a group can be comforting. Many of us feel a conflict between wanting to fit in and wanting to be different. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is unique. 
Anyone can choose to be more individualistic at any time. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, an American singer, said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing, pursue it and don’t give up. You might confuse some people."" However, this strong expression of individuality is not the same as being eccentric at first. 
If a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric. 
The key to eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be different; they just are. They do not care much about what others think. They act according to who they are. This makes eccentrics different from enthusiasts, pranksters, criminals, show-offs, and recluses. These people are aware of society and often react to it. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. One of the most important is Barbara Ward, a small and fragile woman. She has been at the center of environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these issues better. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I believe her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" It talks about the rapid growth of cities and the big ideas she cared about. It is a powerful call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the interesting world of animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm, showing the skill of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation, but it also deepened my love for the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, this book made me feel hopeful again. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and nature, showing a world worth saving. Some people think humans are the worst because of the harm we have done to other species. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family, showing that we are all connected. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird paintings by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered so much more. It had beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my emotional and creative responses to nature are just as important as scientific ones. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five important British publishers how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually okay with bad reviews. They think that any review can help sales because it makes readers want to see for themselves. Publishers like reviews that match their own feelings about a book since they are often the first to read it.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, especially in a good way. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago. However, many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers should not complain too much because they need reviews to help readers discover books and authors. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several good reviews.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books. Most of our books are not by famous authors, and we do not advertise much, so we rely on literary editors to review our books. Good reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. Good reviews can help a book and an author become successful, but they need support from other sources like recommendations from readers and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the United States, a single review can make or break a book. Here, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a talented writer. Interestingly, some poorly received books or books without reviews can still sell very well. It is all very unpredictable, but non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people paid attention. Now, sometimes it is the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that started in ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something special that shows the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's work is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. He realized that there were endless ideas for designs. So, he decided to focus on making weathervanes.
Before this, Graham trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change their roles. Liz went to work as an architectural assistant, and Graham stayed home to take care of their children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic. I really enjoy designing.""
Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are still popular. Graham believes that people like handmade items because they are different.
He does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. He says, ""I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something beautiful."" For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like his.
Graham is now busier than ever, sending weathervanes to customers all over the world, especially in America and Denmark. He explains that the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."

CAE_23,C1,"**Young Masters**
Bobby Fischer is trying to return to chess, but age is against him. Chess is now more of a young man's game. After being away from chess for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in great shape. Spassky is even older.
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now there is a professional chess circuit. Today, the main goal for players is to win. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time. If they don’t, they lose the game. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This has made it harder for older players.
In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Of the ten best players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Many players prepare before matches, especially because computers can store many chess games and help players study their opponents. In recent matches, players have had teams of helpers working to find weaknesses in their opponent's game. The beginning of a chess game is now studied very carefully, and being well-prepared can decide the game.
Today, there are more top players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. If they lose concentration, they can lose the game. The chess clock adds to the stress. At the end of a game, players often rush to make their moves in a ""time scramble,"" where they have only seconds to act. This creates a tense situation where nerves and determination are crucial.
For top chess players, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to compete again the next day. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches can be even tougher. For example, a match in 1984 between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov had to stop after several months because both players were exhausted.
Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game surprising. If he has returned for money, he will do well, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,C1,"**Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. He says, ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low. It won't be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before he wrote *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed. It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know it would be hard to manage. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He realized he wanted to write for actors because he wanted his writing to be heard, not just read. He says, ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in school. It was very inspiring.""
**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, who is 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. He remembers, ""University was very theoretical. It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his best partnership has been with Steve Coogan. Simon admits, ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was copying him.""
**C** Ciaran McMenamin, who is 24, became well-known when he danced on TV in the show *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. He says, ""It's been a great opportunity for me. Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a lucky position for someone who just graduated. Ciaran's early career shows that he was always meant to be recognized. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he acted for four years. He laughs, ""I was using acting to avoid doing homework. But then I decided I wanted to take it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for more praise, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. He says, ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor, who is 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a deal for three albums with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. Neil says, ""The record company has a different idea of success than I do. They want a big hit, but for me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music business ever since. He says, ""It's funny how things happen. I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were times I felt very down, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E** Stephen Richards is a 27-year-old poet and author who has won many awards and honors. He is already well-known in the poetry world, where he has been performing and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. He says, ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't write as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. He decided not to go to university, but after getting bored with a job at a theater, he changed his mind. After university, he published his first book, a children's book, in 1992. He says, ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry getting great reviews, moving to novels is a big step for him. He explains, ""My poetry has a structure, but a novel can be any length, so there are more chances to make mistakes. My main goal is to avoid just writing a lot without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"A. Isabel is a 31-year-old art student who thinks she looks good in jeans, but she rarely wears them because she doesn’t want to be seen with the wrong people. She is looking for Mr. Right but worries that her knobbly knees might stop her from finding him. Despite this, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired,"" making the story feel like an old silent film.
B. This story is about the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart but shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, which was started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays a mix of singers, preachers, and soap-opera stars. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old stores and classic cars.
C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk to his wife’s first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a beautiful Russian poetess, he shares his feelings with his wife’s ex-husband. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get help for her brother who is in prison. The author skillfully untangles these problems with humor and insight into relationships, making the story enjoyable and clever.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of the novel, James Hudson, a wealthy American, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake as the editor. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved, and one of them married, was killed years ago. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is engaging. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters.
E. This story, written by a talented American author, is funny and touching. It follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an unusual bachelor. The story explores many emotions and shows the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that balances sadness and laughter perfectly."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four academic writers talk about international volunteer work.
A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work really helps development a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money was given directly to a local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have much skill or experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers really want to help the community or if they are more interested in improving their own careers. However, these projects can help develop people who will act ethically and help those in need in the future.
B. Volunteering can lead to better understanding between countries, help solve conflicts, and encourage people to participate in global issues. It can also create international social networks among regular people. In this way, both the volunteers and the communities they help can benefit. But if only wealthy people can volunteer, it may help them in their careers without really helping the communities that need it most. Those who volunteer may continue to gain benefits while using the communities as a way to advance their own lives.
C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that is more about helping the volunteers than the communities. It can also provide important technical help for development. When done well, international volunteering can bring benefits to both the volunteers and the organizations they work with, while also allowing for the sharing of skills and experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness about the unfair power relations and deep-rooted causes of poverty and injustice.
D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the idea of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially when people are frustrated with big governments and businesses. However, this approach can ignore the need for democratic government and reduce development to individual acts of charity. While volunteering is a good act, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can weaken the real conversation about development. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from understanding global inequalities and the poverty many people face in developing countries."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and we often need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group of us, including inventor Tom Granger and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different models.
One model has a 'dual alarm function.' This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. However, it does not let you snooze and wake up later as I thought. Since this model costs about the same as another one we tested, it is a good deal because it has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to a quiet morning. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was a problem. It is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave enough space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn’t work.""
This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can easily tap it with your eyes closed. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, which made me want to play with them. This was a mistake when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. However, we found it hard to set up, but once we did, we felt cool and smart.
Tom Granger thought this model, which has a built-in lamp, was ""very cheap"" in quality. He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was hard to position, and you couldn’t read by it because it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that the radio was difficult to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, which made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people with its bright colors, which appealed to Tom Granger and me. Tom said, ""I would choose this one because it stands out more than the others."" The traditional controls made it the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes, meaning it might ring 10 minutes earlier or later than you set it. Paul Bridges laughed at this idea and said the model was ""very annoying"" and ""completely useless.""
The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was ""very standard and took up little space."" It also has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easier to use. He said, ""With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed the buttons in the right order."" He agreed that radio quality has improved because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was not very good, and so did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"**Hedgehogs**
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, so their spines point outwards. This helps protect them, but how well it works depends on how many spines they have. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have adapted to their environment. These hedgehogs are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
Excelling in any sport is hard, even for men, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competing take up a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite this, they are overcoming challenges and breaking records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or it’s windy, and I can’t see well, but I keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside of skiing because we train for ten months each year. I give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated the same - it’s a young sport.""
**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing since I had never cycled before! I earn good money as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not because I am a good cyclist. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day on the bike, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because very few schools offer it. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Also, coaches often change, so the women’s team lacks stability. But I love it, and being fit is great, plus there is a good social life.""
**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not knowing how big it was! I felt trapped in Britain and wanted freedom. Each walk has been different. Walking across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with very little sleep and had many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""
**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when they drive. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, some men think they must beat me, so I have had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and strong. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are joining racing every year. I love saloon car racing because I always aim for a perfect lap.""
**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before a race, and I push myself hard. I often ask myself why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the news, 90% of the articles focus on the men’s events, and only 10% mention the women’s. The prize money is not as good either. But now we have formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to help improve this."""
CAE_34,C1,"**The Day I Met Picasso**
Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could see Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the water. I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.
Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have had the courage to go over and ask for his signature if my friend hadn’t encouraged me. I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, and to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added some lively lines below. These lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbour.
I thanked him and started a conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was not great either, an American woman at the table helped us communicate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. But I told Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work.
After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend what I had. He noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and asked, ""Is that all?"" He encouraged me to go back and talk to Picasso again, saying I might not get another chance like this. So, with my sketchbook, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided not to ask if I could draw his portrait, as I was afraid he might say no. Instead, I just stood there, set up my pad, and started to draw.
When Picasso saw me, he smiled and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny faces and made silly gestures, like rolling his eyes and sticking out his tongue. It was like he was playing a game. I felt like giving up, but his playful spirit made me want to keep going. After a while, he finally relaxed and let me study him without moving. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were very captivating.
Even though he was with friends, he seemed a bit distant and alone. He let his friends talk while he quietly focused on his own thoughts. When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded in approval. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw.
I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In just a few seconds, he drew a face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes to my nose and captured my smile with just one lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks. 
I thanked Picasso and asked if he could sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he was not going to give me another one! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? This article explains how stores encourage you to spend more money.
**A. The Fresh Look**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store look fresh. They might also have a bakery that fills the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind people of fresh food. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.
**B. Smart Product Placement**  
Where products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas are most popular with shoppers. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are more likely to be bought. Stores also use ""dump bins"" for special offers to attract bargain hunters. They often place related items together, like desserts near ice cream.
**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more expensive items on their way. Stores also put popular products far from the entrance, hoping loyal customers will look for them and see other tempting items.
**D. Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain shows fewer items on the shelves, making them seem special. Even though their clothes are mass-produced, their store design makes them look exclusive.
**E. Total Costs Matter**  
Shoppers care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with more expensive items. They sometimes sell staples at a loss to attract customers, a strategy called ""loss leaders."" They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in large amounts or giving products good display space.
**F. The Price Tag**  
Shoppers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy can also help reduce theft by making cashiers ring up sales for small change.
**G. Lighting Matters**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh foods look more appealing.
**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the paths through the store, while another marks sales areas. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use nicer carpets in sales areas to encourage shoppers to explore.
**I. In-Store Promotions**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see big pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to encourage impulse buying and can increase sales significantly."
CAE_26,C1,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington, who is 58 years old, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht named Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*, he called Robin to ask for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris how to sail. This was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to shore to practice climbing.
The climbing route was quite hard, but Chris was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. They reached a big drop, and Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. When they finished, Robin politely asked if he could climb down using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Chris was not very happy about it, but Robin managed to lower himself down safely.
During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a big step from their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions first. Most of the time, people were too afraid to give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making.
Chris found sailing difficult and boring. He preferred the excitement of a crisis, but he struggled with being on the sea for many days. He liked being on land and was not very handy. Robin, on the other hand, was a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because he knew Robin could manage without him. The crew was also very close together, with six people on a yacht meant for four. On a mountain trip, you can get away from each other more easily.
When they reached Greenland and it was Chris's turn to lead, he found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety. There were times when if Robin fell, he could pull Chris down with him. Chris had to be careful. He also underestimated how hard climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin was not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin trusted Chris completely and just followed him. When it became too difficult, Chris knew they had to turn back, and Robin accepted this. 
Chris also knew that Robin was worried about their boat and whether it would be okay in the ice. Still, Robin wanted to try climbing the mountain again. The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They were taking turns to keep watch on the yacht. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his shift, but Robin decided not to wake him because he thought he could handle it alone. Chris had almost fallen asleep the night before, and he felt that Robin did not trust him. He told Robin how he felt, and Robin quickly reassured him that he was wrong to think that.
Although they enjoyed their trip to Skye, they did not really get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. Chris discovered that Robin, despite his tough appearance, was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been around for a very long time, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this important part of our history.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, they found apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, ancient people even stored apple halves to eat in winter. But these apples were wild crab apples, which are small and not like the apples we eat today.
**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and this knowledge was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but many did not grow well in Britain. After the Normans came, they started to grow apples that were better suited to the British climate. Monks in Britain also experimented with apples, and many of today’s apples come from these early varieties.
**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. However, bad weather, the Black Death, and wars led to fewer apples being grown, and more were imported. In the 16th century, King Henry VIII sent a fruit expert to France to learn more about growing apples. He returned with many new apple types, including the famous Pippins.
**Settler Treasure (1750)**  
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who went to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers brought them to America. In North America, a man named John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted many apple trees and became famous for it.
**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
In Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from a dead tree. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. When he showed it at a fruit show, a judge called it 'Delicious'. This apple became very popular around the world.
**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was known as 'Granny Smith' because she took care of her family’s farm. In 1868, she discovered a small tree growing from old fruit. She moved it, and soon she was harvesting green apples that became famous worldwide. She believed that something good could come from what others thought was useless.
**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most come from just a few types that are chosen for their looks or how well they travel, not for their taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as many old apple types have disappeared, especially in the US. However, people are starting to want more different kinds of apples. It is important for everyone to help protect the variety of apples and other foods we have."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain, known for running 10,000 meters. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is located ten miles south of the equator. The camp is near Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. For the last three years, Richard has trained in this beautiful but quiet place during the winter. However, he had never trained with Kenyan runners before. 
On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard decided to change this. He ran in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for competitions. He was invited by the national team coach after he finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race. This was a great opportunity for him. Training at high altitudes helps runners produce more red blood cells, which improves their ability to carry oxygen. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful.
Richard's first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race held in Africa, in Nairobi. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan. He felt he did well, but he knows that Kenyan runners' success is not just because of the high altitude. They have a simple and relaxed approach to running, and they enjoy competing.
During his time at the training camp, Richard learned how the Kenyan runners train. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and plants. The living conditions are basic, with six athletes sharing a room. Their daily routine includes three training sessions: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They start their day at six in the morning. The coach reminds them to take it easy during the morning run because they have a tough day ahead. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they only run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast, which includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with dishes like ugali (a maize dish), stew, and vegetables. After training, they often go to bathe in streams that come from the melting glaciers of Mount Kenya.
By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just about genetics or the altitude. He believes that the simple lifestyle, hard training, and passion for running are important reasons for Kenya's success in long-distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**
Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem started in early 1989, before the recession really began. The decline in advertising is happening all over the world. The main issue is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large groups of people and big media, but as more brands and media appear, the target audiences have become smaller and more specific. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you might buy several of the same brand. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For things like cars, you might only buy one every three years. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Overall, you likely do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 
Now, compare that to the 32,500 brands and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year, we focus on 9,500 brands that are analyzed. The average person buys about 400 of those 9,500 brands, and not all because of advertising. This means that about 96% of advertising is wasted, but no one knows which part is wasted.
When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. Most people find that only about 1 in 16 commercials (6%) are relevant to them, meaning 94% of the commercials are likely wasted. Many people think they are different and not influenced by advertising, but that is not true. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. 
Advertising is often wasteful because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. Many ads have shown that they work. Advertisers need to reach a lot of people to find the few who will respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested. 
Even the best-targeted ads do not get a 100% response rate. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every person they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all. 
Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers (about 2% of adults) is doing well. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be very happy with a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can reach 2% of the population is very successful, and that is a small part of the population. 
To improve advertising, the messages need to be more focused on specific groups than ever before."
CAE_43,C1,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits a Green Home**
Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting surprises. First, there is Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral. It is famous for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen in the thirteenth century. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales have created a home that uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost for the garden, and heats the house using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's older buildings and was approved by planners, even though it is in a conservation area.
When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Once inside, you must take off your shoes, as Robert insists on this. The house feels calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is designed to keep out drafts. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They wanted to create a building that did not produce carbon dioxide. They also decided to avoid using mains water. They designed special toilets that compost waste, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean. They filter the water before using it. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.
Robert says, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is better for the environment without living in darkness."" The only old-fashioned part of the house is the hall, which has a fireplace and a staircase that goes up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay for water, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.
Soon, they will install solar panels in the garden, which will help the house use even less electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will produce extra electricity. One day, they hope to have enough to charge an electric car. The only heating in the house is a small wood-burning stove, which they only use on very cold days. 
When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no drafts and everything was at the same temperature. He mentioned that a woman from the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggested that people living in old houses should go back to how people lived back then, but this idea might be hard to accept.
The secret of the house is that it is simple and low-tech, so there are not many things that can go wrong. Most materials were bought from a local builder's merchant and installed by local workers, making the house affordable to build. It cost the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Not surprisingly, big building companies do not want this idea to become popular."
CAE_51,C1,"**The Camera Never Lies**
Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof that these tiny creatures existed. He published the photos with an article where he accepted fairies as wonderful supernatural beings. 
However, in 1939, the two women who took the photos confessed that they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the simple trick showed that photography can be misleading. 
Many people believe that photography is always true, but that is not the case. Today, we can use computer software to change our digital images. Photography has never been completely innocent; from the beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
Throughout history, iron has captured the human imagination, and blacksmiths, who work with iron, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also considered artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths.
However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with manufacturers of gates and balconies often calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks that look the same.
Fortunately, there are new events to promote the blacksmith's craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, twist, and weld it more easily. Dawson explains, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.""
About 250 pieces of work are displayed in the show, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual artists, but a part of every sale will be used by the Association to promote good ironwork. Dawson has created an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and take shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space.""
Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals that are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable."" Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles that look like they belong in a scary castle. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever.""
No other metal gives people as much visual pleasure or a sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we don’t have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying for me too. 
The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn’t plan to stop smoking, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressure from people who are against smoking, and I still feel that way. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I got over colds faster than my friends who tried to live healthier.
On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session in Birmingham called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking. I was there to write an article about other people trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t try to stop myself; that wouldn’t be fair. I’m here to write, not to quit."" I thought I was being reasonable because I really enjoyed smoking. It made me happy.
The counselor seemed to understand me. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just like smoking had become a challenge, the idea of quitting began to feel good. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that was just for me. 
Quitting was easier than I thought. The strong desire for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn’t a problem at all. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without smoking, but I managed just fine. 
Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing things at home on weekend mornings. I realized that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was something to do. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a break at the theater. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,C1,"**Dorothy Who?**
Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they respond with excitement and say things like, ""Surely there's already a biography?"" they pass my test. 
Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She won a Nobel Prize, which should make her famous. If someone in literature won a Nobel Prize, everyone would know them. Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was an amazing person. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and the global sharing of science.
When I started my research, I wanted to read biographies of scientists. A friend of Hodgkin suggested I read about Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of hers and also worked in science. I went to a bookshop but found that there were no biographies of Pauling available. I was surprised because he was a very important chemist and won Nobel Prizes for both chemistry and peace.
Even scientists sometimes think that biographies about scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, a Nobel Prize winner, said that the lives of scientists are often boring to read. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers feel the same. 
People often see scientists as different from artists, writers, or politicians. This idea makes it hard for scientists to be recognized as interesting people. Some scientists do not want to be seen in the media because they do not want to seem like they are promoting themselves. This can make science seem less inviting to young people.
However, things are changing. Scientists are now appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives out prizes on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help people see scientists as real people, not just researchers.
The world of publishing is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and not very interesting. They often did not talk much about the scientist's personal life, like their family. But this has changed with books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"", which is funny and touching. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Marie Curie are shown with their flaws.
Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her work. She discovered the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and she also worked on insulin. She was a mother of three and had a husband who was often away for work. Her personal life is not directly related to her science, but it shows how she balanced everything in her life.
There is much to learn from her life, but her scientific work is also very important. Understanding her passion for science is a challenge for biographers because many readers may not know enough science to understand complex ideas. Learning science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just takes practice.
It is sad that educated people often do not know about important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,C1,"**Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers need her help because their wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business that uses machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. They have a success rate of over 90%.
This ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground is called dowsing. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical reasons like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One popular idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers believe they can feel these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a strong sense.
Recently, during dry years, Margaret has been very busy. She often has a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers include people with holiday homes far from water pipes and developers building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She explains, ""You can't drill where there is a risk of waste getting into the water. The water we find is in safe rock layers, and if we bring it up correctly, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, we have to be careful about minerals like iron.""
Electricity is also needed to run the pump, and it is expensive to bring power over long distances. So, it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. After thinking about all this, Margaret starts her search for water.
For large areas like golf courses, she first uses a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. It swings when she is above a water source. After finding possible areas on the map, she walks over the fields with her hazel stick. 
When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She then uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. Holding the two forks of the stick, she pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is below, the straight part of the stick rises,"" she says. It is very important to drill exactly where the stick points. If they drill even a little in the wrong place, they might miss the water. 
Margaret's husband also checks the same area. Usually, they agree on where to drill, but if they disagree, they keep looking until they find a spot they both agree on.
Margaret is not alone in her work; many researchers and writers are interested in this unusual skill. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this special ability, how could her family continue to run their well-drilling business year after year?"
CAE_36,C1,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**
Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be fun to try something different! We helped four people do just that. Here’s what happened.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda is 23 years old and a mother of two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. 
Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and full of people. It was very different from her hometown, and she felt nervous. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was even harder! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when Amanda tried, the drinks fell and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and told her it happens to everyone.
By 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers outside, and Amanda felt even more nervous. She worried about remembering the orders, but luckily, everything was done with computers. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. Every time a customer spoke to her, she had to ask them to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was very tired and just wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, and Amanda was shocked. She never knew waitressing could be so tiring. She thought it was an easy job, but it actually requires a lot of energy and a friendly attitude. Amanda realized she could not handle the busy Saturday nights. She was also disappointed with the tips she received. In the end, she was happy to return to her children, as being a mother felt much easier after her day as a waitress!
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy is 30 years old and was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She knew Amanda's daughters were a bit cheeky, but she thought she could manage. 
When Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have three hours of peace. But she was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded her that she still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry.
At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. But when she brought Sophie home from school, things got chaotic. The girls turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly while playing. Cindy thought they would tire out soon, but she was wrong again. She tried to get them to bed by 8 pm, but then they kept asking for water so they could come downstairs to watch TV. It was exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. 
Cindy realized that taking care of two small children was very tiring. She had no time for herself, and the responsibility was overwhelming. However, she enjoyed the day overall.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary is 42 years old and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a primary school teacher. 
On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, but on this day, she got to sleep in until 7 am, which felt great! She was nervous about how to dress for school. When she arrived, there were about 400 students at the assembly, and she hoped she wouldn’t stand out too much.
In class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from how Rosemary learned in school. She helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. After lunch, she attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. 
Later, she had a silent reading lesson and then a fun French lesson where the children practiced speaking with her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, Rosemary was very tired, but the children had so much energy! The hardest part for her was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Although teachers have more holidays, Rosemary decided she prefers farming.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary is 30 years old and arrived at Rosemary's farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! Rosemary's farm is very big, with many cows and sheep. 
Hilary spent most of the morning in the ice-cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice cream. It was hard not to eat the treats! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are not helped quickly, they can die, so it is important to check them every day.
After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! Hilary found the day lonely and missed being around children because animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of the job was that there is no time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, making it hard to plan vacations. Farming may seem romantic, but the reality is very different. The income can be unstable, and Hilary wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,C1,"**A Trumpet Isn't Just for Christmas**
It is surprising how many musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who did not play music, grew up in a small town in southern Sweden. At the age of 30, he has become a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by old composers and new pieces.
When you meet him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s top concert halls. A television show was made about his work, filmed in London and Sweden.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo. His music career started when he was eight years old. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet for Christmas instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played the trumpet all the time. His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give him lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, saw Hardenberger's natural talent right away. Hardenberger feels lucky to have had such a passionate teacher.
Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. Each trumpet has its own small problems, and no two mouthpieces are exactly the same. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and work with them.
From the beginning, Hardenberger had a special sound that people could recognize. Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player who played in orchestras, Hardenberger always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a trumpet player.
At 15, he needed to decide where to study. His teacher wanted him to go to America, but his parents thought it was too far and dangerous. Instead, he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not as exciting as being a soloist.
Hardenberger knew he played better than many of his peers. When he entered a competition at 17, Thibaud suggested he join for experience. He learned the first round of pieces and made it to the second round. He was surprised to reach the final, where he faced a difficult concerto. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that people were listening to him.
Hardenberger is realistic about his talent. He does not want to analyze what makes his music special because he believes it might ruin it. He thinks the power of music is that it can always touch people's hearts."

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the bad parts, and what a typical workday is like for them.
**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  
**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I do surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to do surgery can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I’m operating, but I do worry about what I will do the next day. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it goes well, it feels amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I meet with patients to explain their surgeries. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but I sometimes feel rushed. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and I often dream about operating.""
**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  
**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with only a little design work. I get a brief from the client about what they want. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. If they like my ideas, we work on budgets and I hire photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well. When I get home, it’s usually between 7:30 pm and 8:30 pm, and sometimes later. It’s hard for me to relax after a busy day.""
**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  
**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on some days, I wake up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I have to be careful about my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Most of my jobs are booked in advance, which helps me plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. But most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""
**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  
**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mostly take care of gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each place. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a cafe for breakfast. In summer, I might work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I get back, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually meet them in the evening. We like to use old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes clients have strange ideas, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I sleep well because my job is very physical, and I’m always tired at the end of the day.""
**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  
**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the work site by 8:30 am. I am an assistant engineer, and I help build bridges and a wall to keep cars safe. I check that the workers are following the schedule and safety rules. I also help solve any problems. The workers start at 6 am, so my first job is to find out what happened since I left the night before. I usually have paperwork to review or questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat while I work. I need to keep a good relationship with the workers, even if we sometimes disagree. I usually leave the site around 6 pm, and I am always on call."""
CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards program in Europe. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then check my emails. I work with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan our advertising strategy. I have many meetings during the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and check the mail, which includes about ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these are very important to the artists, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we start working on their first album, choosing songs and producers. I also manage budgets and spending. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm and often go to concerts in the evening, sometimes seeing up to five new bands. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.
**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule for client meetings. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and selling furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000. I spend time working with restorers and other specialists to fix the furniture we buy. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business. I do the accounts once a month and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax after work.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set schedule. When I have an early shift, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. I work for about an hour and a half at one station, then take a break and switch to another station. My team controls aircraft movements, handling about 1,000 flights a day in winter and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I can read about new air traffic rules during my breaks. This job is stressful, and I find it hard to relax after my shift. I hope to become a watch manager and then a general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by getting the electronic sales system ready. I make sure someone is watching the cash register and organize lunch breaks for the staff. I spend the morning helping customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be frustrating when they expect me to quickly gather many books for them. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new book titles with them. I need to ensure that new titles arrive on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work a late shift, closing the store and going home afterward.
**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for companies working abroad and warn clients about possible problems. I provide three services: an online news preview, a security forecast, and a travel information guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will cover. I need to finish my first news preview by 10:00 am and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, but it’s hard to relax, and I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps bring about change. Leadership is not about being tall or smart. According to Pat Dixon, who wrote the book *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is very important. A good leader should be able to express their ideas clearly and confidently. Dixon says it’s about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more potential to be leaders than they think. To become a leader, you need to recognize your hidden talents, develop them, and use them. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it is easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. However, leadership is now seen as very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and supported you. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first boss led well; the second one managed poorly.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, who wrote *Leadership Rules*, says, ""A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a struggling organization, whether it’s a company, a sports team, or a country.""
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Working together is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually follow others, try taking the lead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better and advance in your career.
F.  
- Leadership does not just happen. It develops when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don’t think that your way of leading will always please your colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your contribution is essential and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller called Abyss. The story is about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine that is stuck deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud and his team, remind us of tough heroes from older movies. The special effects and set design are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Overall, the story feels like a typical B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This version of the book by James Jones, about the battle for Guadalcanal, is directed by Andrew Marton. It is different from Terrence Malick's new film, which is more poetic. Marton’s film is a more traditional war movie and focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. While Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's version has some strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.
**C. On Guard**  
This fun swashbuckler is based on a novel from 1875. It is better than many other musketeer films. The villain, played by Fabrice Luchini, is a sneaky politician causing trouble. Vincent Perez plays a lively hero, and Daniel Auteuil, who is more serious, also has good moments as a swordsman. The film uses familiar costume drama ideas but does it with a lot of humor and charm.
**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film tells a serious story. The detailed costumes and sets make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays a harsh bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. His difficult relationship with his son is the main focus, but the filmmakers spend too much time on the details and not enough on the dark story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released film shows off director Leone's skills. The sound is especially good, making every noise clear. The story is very harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement back. The characters, played by Clint Eastwood, Lee van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, are all morally questionable as they travel through the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war film features many international stars and has four directors and 23,000 extras. However, it feels too long and slow, especially in the early scenes where soldiers wait for news about an invasion. While it is impressive in terms of logistics, it is better suited for the big screen. Watching it on video does not give the same experience."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new career after leaving a powerful law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. It follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the rich people of the Italian Renaissance, as he gets involved in politics, church secrets, and serious crimes. Even though the story is complicated and a bit too long, it is still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She gets involved in a mystery when a strange man dies in front of her. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, Leah is brave and smart, making her a great character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a clever private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and sharp, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thinking and philosophy than usual. Parker always provides high-quality entertainment.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has her usual detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, looking into a robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and focus on unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has all the classic elements of romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a character who is supposed to be a victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels that this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the story is not as strong as his usual work.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. It follows Canadian police as they search for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it much better than an average detective novel."
CAE_57,C1,"I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. I have traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. I slowly realized I was giving up my own happiness for my job. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 
I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children. They wouldn’t want to change places with me, but they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship, and I don’t have big career goals. I feel like I should make the most of my freedom, especially for my friends! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the renting? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and I’m already behind schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” 
It’s hard to let go of emotional ties. I’m putting it off because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. More and more people in their late twenties and thirties in Britain want to break free from their lives and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that many people who used to say, “I wish I had that chance,” are now realizing they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.
For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip.” He knows he might return to the same job position, but he believes it’s a risk worth taking. When he left the office, he threw his calculator into the river as a sign of freedom!
For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. He needed to break away from the strict way of doing things in the military to live better as a civilian. There are many reasons for people my age to travel, but some common reasons exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says that today’s workforce is more flexible. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if their contract ends, they have nothing to lose. Some big companies even allow career breaks, knowing that trained employees will return instead of going to competitors.
Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more thirty-somethings are thinking about their lives. If people are unhappy with their jobs, they now know they can change things. Travel gives them a chance to think about their lives. Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can’t handle adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. She believes it shows we are better educated and more stable, focusing on living a balanced life. We are taking the time to ask ourselves, “Is this what I want?”
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he is running away. He says he is running towards something he wants. But he feels nervous about leaving his comfortable routine, like going to the office every day and chatting with everyone over coffee. I share Ben’s worries about leaving a stable life with few challenges. I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult to work with. 
Jennifer Cox points out that it’s common for a big event, like a breakup or losing a job, to push people to travel. It took a little push for me to get moving, but now I feel excited about the next 12 months. No matter what happens, I will be proud to have taken this chance. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt lost with all the new technology. She shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career. I felt like my skills were old-fashioned, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were common. I worried that no one would want me in a newsroom because I didn’t know how to use a computer. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought it would be easier to host a seminar on nuclear physics than to learn how to use a computer. I was not good with technology; even calculators confused me, and I didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.
I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my kids would be hard, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package! We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world of the Internet and started chatting with people from around the globe. My kids stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking my kids to school.
My children were already good with computers from school, but I was nervous. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong! I learned the basic skills I needed, and it was easier than I thought. With practice, I got better every day. I started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I felt proud to balance work and family life.
How has the computer helped me? I used to work at a messy desk and often lost important papers. Now, the computer helps me stay organized. I can keep track of money with spreadsheets and use ready-made invoices and letterheads, which saves me time. As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask questions in forums, and talk about working from home with people worldwide.
However, working from home has its downsides. I can feel lonely without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and my kids sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. But many people in my neighborhood are buying computers, not just for learning and fun, but also for work. 
A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user today: they are around 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have printers and modems. I feel like I am doing well with technology. Who knows, maybe one day I will be emailing articles to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. The possibilities seem endless!"
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The Tartan Museum is located in Edinburgh, Scotland. Its modern buildings look very different from the historic city around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see what it was like inside.
You cannot miss the new Museum of Scotland. It is on the corner of Chambers Street and has a big yellow tower and unique buildings that look like cheese wedges. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were not so sure.
Now that the inside is almost ready, people are wondering if the exhibitions will be just as interesting. The museum tells the story of Scotland through many different objects. There is a timeline to help visitors understand the history, but it does not limit the displays. The museum shows important items, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots and silver from Holyrood chapel, without being too proud of them.
Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants visitors to enjoy their experience. He believes the museum should be for everyone, not just experts. He does not want to use fake scenes from the past because he thinks it is important to show the truth. This means that what you see in the museum is based on what experts know.
However, it is still unclear if the stories of the objects can be told well enough with just explanations and a few computers. Just before the opening, some things are clear. The views of Edinburgh Castle are amazing, and the museum has many different spaces. The galleries connect to each other, and the walls look like large stone blocks. Natural light comes in through special windows and roof lights, making it a nice place to look at the displays.
The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of kids aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland. They wanted to have fun experiences with the displays. Although they could not have rides, they got a special area for hands-on activities. The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change every three years and shows items chosen by Scottish people that have influenced life in Scotland, like electric guitars and televisions.
Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that real objects help us understand the past better than anything else. The modern design of the museum is impressive from the inside, but some people wonder if it is in the right place."
CAE_54,C1,"**The Future of Newspapers**
The change from print newspapers to online news is happening slowly. Change can be scary for some people, but it can also be a good thing. However, the move to online news is not easy and can be uncomfortable. Many people believe that print newspapers will eventually disappear because fewer people are buying them. Sales of print newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, while visits to their websites are increasing.
But not everything is clear. A recent survey showed that worldwide newspaper sales actually went up by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have fallen, countries in Asia have seen an increase. News magazines, which many think are struggling, also reported a 5.4% increase in sales.
The same is true for books. E-readers like Kindle are very popular, and their sales have increased a lot this year. However, when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books, they found that sales were only down by 0.4%. This shows that people are buying both e-books and physical books.
Many people believe that young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but this is not entirely true. The latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, newspaper sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.
In the past, experts thought that online advertising would help newspapers succeed online. However, digital advertising on newspaper websites is now decreasing. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be to offer both print and digital subscriptions together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. 
However, running both a website and a print edition is challenging and expensive for newspaper companies. Print newspapers still have a strong presence, but it is harder for them to be noticed online."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be challenging. Photographers need to pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so you can see all their faces.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Don’t pretend you are not taking a picture when it’s obvious. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel self-conscious. You may need to guide them to look more natural.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture looks better if the subject is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. If they seem distracted, remind them just before you take the photo. You can also say something funny to get a genuine reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural, as if you are observing them without them noticing.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can create sympathy. Look for common expressions like smiles, frowns, or gestures like thumbs-up.
**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more interest. Make sure the background does not distract from the subject. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject stand out.
**H. Interaction**  
Good photos often happen when people are interacting, like talking or laughing together. Look for moments of connection, such as eye contact or a friendly touch.
**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To show both the people and the place, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background. Make sure the people are close enough to be seen clearly.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone, a clear posed picture is good. However, family photos can be more fun if they capture real moments instead of stiff poses. Candid shots often bring back memories better than posed ones."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. This means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.
Not many artists do not sign their work unless someone asks them to, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She does not care about being seen as a great artist. She believes, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This makes it hard for her during interviews. ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" she says. When asked if she minds being photographed, she covers her face in surprise.
After 30 minutes, Sarah is more relaxed, and the interview becomes fun and interesting. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she spent two years drawing at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not happy with illustration and started working with a well-known decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that changed everything for her. ""Suddenly my interest got channelled,"" she explains. She decided to start her own business, not knowing exactly what would happen but feeling it was the right choice.
Sarah's skills in observing details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. She often gets asked where people can learn this art, but she believes it cannot be taught. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she says. She is always learning and believes that if you think you know everything, you should stop trying.
Sarah is honest about her weaknesses. For example, she says, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math. When she had a big project to paint the ceiling of a chapel, she got confused with the measurements. She thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" This self-doubt makes her feel distant from her talent. Sometimes she talks about herself in the third person, saying, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""
Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art is very special and stands out from others. She has many important projects for businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by buildings. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can walk into two more rooms.
However, there is a risk with trompe-l'oeil art. Once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. Sarah knows this well. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination. That is the most important part.""
Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal for the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not. She listens carefully to understand what they want. Many clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.
Sarah appreciates her clients. ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls,"" she admits. They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even if she does not like to talk about her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" 
While this may be true, you could never get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be better known, and I am happy to share it with others."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman looks at the important ""people skills"" needed to succeed in our jobs.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged not only by how smart we are or by our training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future job opportunities. They are different from what we learned in school, where doing well on tests was seen as the most important thing. Now, it is assumed that we all have enough intelligence and skills to do our jobs. The focus is on social skills and personal qualities, like being proactive, understanding others, being flexible, and convincing people. These are known as emotional intelligence.
B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. For many years, people have talked about these qualities using different names, like ""character"" or ""soft skills."" Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, called ""emotional intelligence."" This means being aware of and managing our own feelings and the feelings of others, and using these feelings to guide our actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. Some people think it just means ""being nice,"" but sometimes it requires being honest, even if it is uncomfortable. It is not about expressing all feelings freely, but about managing them so that we can work well together towards our goals.
C. More businesses are realizing that encouraging emotional intelligence is important for good management. The more complex a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can affect their ability to use their technical knowledge. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer service are key, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.
D. While a person’s IQ does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we go through life and learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us succeed, especially now when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling companies, nor does it guarantee success. However, if we ignore the human side of work, nothing else will work as well as it could."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of important news events. However, social media has changed how people share these photos. Many journalists now look to social networks for images when news happens quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used photos from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event, which means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure that people are paid fairly for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health problems, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it regularly for pain relief.
**What is Acupuncture?**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel unwell.
When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check where the Qi is unbalanced. They do this by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, feelings, and habits. The acupuncturist uses very thin needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.
**Acupuncture Points**
The points where needles are placed are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. Many people say they feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists believe this feeling means the needle has reached the Qi.
There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less often.
**Scientific Understanding**
Even though Western doctors do not fully accept traditional Chinese medicine, many agree that acupuncture can help with pain relief. They have found scientific reasons for how it might work. For example, it is thought that acupuncture can block pain signals from reaching the brain or that it can release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.
**Types of Pain Treated**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. Common pains treated with acupuncture include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**Modern Use of Acupuncture**
Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture is effective. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, including tonsillectomies and heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. Some people report that pain is greatly reduced, but this can vary.
**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**
Like many alternative therapies, it is hard to study acupuncture in clinical trials. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helpful for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate. They know it does not work for everyone, and some people may need six to seven visits to feel significant relief, although some improvement can be felt after just two or three visits.
**A Different View of Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and want to know what outside factors might be causing the pain, such as weather conditions. They also ask about the type of pain, like whether it is sharp or dull. This information helps them decide how to treat the pain, which is not something most doctors would consider.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using their methods can lead to better and longer-lasting results. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P. D. James is a famous crime writer known for her clever and complex stories. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She has a calm and confident presence, which makes it easy to imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school. However, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is similar to her, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in private. 
Although she is considered one of the best crime writers in Britain, she is modest about her success. Her 12 detective novels are very popular and read by millions around the world. She enjoys the books of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James also likes to read works by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.
P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student. Life has not always been easy for her. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very sick. P.D. James had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. During this time, her ideas for writing were strong, but she had little time to write. Her husband’s parents helped take care of the children, which gave them some stability.
While working full-time for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She managed several psychiatric clinics and later worked for 11 years at the Home Office, dealing with police and juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she loved the challenge of writing crime stories. 
P.D. James did not want to write about her own difficult experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a good way to learn how to be a serious novelist. She realized that she could follow the traditional rules of detective stories and still write meaningful novels about people. For her, writing detective stories is a way to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is important, even if it is not perfect. She believes that nobody truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,C1,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help show certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer, and can reveal emotional issues.
More companies are using handwriting analysis to help with job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and mental health professionals are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can indicate social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if someone should focus on arts or sciences and if they have a trustworthy or tricky character.""
According to Ms. Marne, graphology can help identify possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have messy handwriting, which can show emotional problems. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have not developed emotionally. This can appear as childish handwriting or writing that goes over letters many times."" 
Ms. Marne claims she can tell if people are honest or manipulative just by looking at their handwriting. She also says that young male offenders often have tall letters, which means they might be dreaming of a better life. Graphologists can sometimes predict if someone is feeling very stressed or if they might harm themselves.
She explains that heart and lung problems can also be seen in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time or if the signature looks different, it could mean something serious has happened."" A big emotional upset can also change a person's signature for a short time.
Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters look like ""threads"" might be clever but tricky. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true feelings. Light pressure in writing can show sensitivity. If someone’s handwriting is very different from standard writing, it can mean they are confident and creative. Disconnected writing often means the person is a loner. Small signatures can show shyness, while circles over the letter ""i"" can mean someone wants attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can show intolerance.
Ms. Marne believes it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting well, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She believes this will happen soon. ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a lot about a person’s history and emotional struggles without asking them questions that they might not answer truthfully.""
Even though this information is interesting, there is not much strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical of graphology. They argue that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the way writing is taught, and it does not have any other meaning."
CAE_41,C1,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**
Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. We had a team of experts to help us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It is surprising that this office works well, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the weather by opening doors or using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be the reason for their happiness: they have created a comfortable working environment without too many rules.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and not very good for working. Many chairs are old and broken, and they do not adjust well. However, the staff have a varied work schedule, which helps them avoid tiredness and boredom.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoy the variety of work and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what everyone is doing but big enough to work alone when needed. The office feels attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.
**Office B: News Service**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality is good, partly because of a No Smoking policy.
- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs and lighting are good. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. However, the office feels impersonal with plain grey walls.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and they have good relationships. The office could be better if the desks were arranged to help share information more easily.
**Office C: Bank**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed reactions from the staff. It feels like being in a glass box, and even with smokers nearby, the air is not stale.
- **Ergonomist:** The office is very standard and not inspiring. The desks are just okay, and some chairs do not meet the needs of the users. The computer setups are outdated.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff support each other and use technology well. There are many awards on display, but the office has a serious look with wood paneling and brown carpets. It is busy with activity.
**Office D: Newspaper**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, causing big temperature changes. The space is messy, and there is not enough desk space. It is also very dusty.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is not suitable for a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not adjust well, making it hard for shorter people to work comfortably.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old brown chairs and dirty carpets. It needs a good cleaning, and the air conditioning must be improved. There were not many conversations when we visited; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million sticks of it every day. This ancient habit has become a big business. Each stick of gum has less than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, which include pine resins and softeners. These help keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always true. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, leading to the growth of a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees for chicle have not been successful. As the chewing gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were created.
Today, only a few chicle gatherers, called chicleros, still collect chicle. They have a hard and dangerous job, walking for miles in very humid conditions. They face many dangers, including poisonous snakes and insects. One insect, the chicle fly, lays its eggs in the ears and nose of the gatherers. Despite these risks, experienced chicleros climb trees quickly to collect the white sap, which they carry back to a camp. There, they boil the sap until it becomes sticky and form it into bricks.
Life at the camp is tough, with a boring diet mostly made of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to save money and meet demand. Gum producers are also finding clever ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were often given gum. One of the biggest claims is that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides important minerals. Gum makers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.
Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to make the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. Additionally, a large area of land in America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Ghanerao Hotel is located in a small village near the Aravalli Hills, known for its craftsmen. The hotel combines the calm of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests. The hotel has basic facilities, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity makes it charming.
B. **NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After a long climb down from a glacier, I was surprised to see this hotel in a beautiful and wild area. It was a wonderful experience to arrive at such a luxurious place after a tiring hike, with a man playing music on the piano.
C. **MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
The Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula in the south-west of Mauritius. The road to the hotel goes along empty beaches where only fishermen are found. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find peace on its nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, you can hardly see the hotel because of the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the calm and beauty of the beach.
D. **ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has a stunning view of the Caribbean Sea. It is quiet and located high up at 1,000 feet. The open rooms look out between two mountains called the Pitons. The hotel has a colonial style with wooden furniture and four-poster beds covered with light fabric.
E. **TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel is on Buyukada, one of the Princes Islands, and is a great place to escape the noise of Istanbul. It takes only an hour by boat to get there. The islands have no cars, only horse-drawn carriages, and beautiful old wooden buildings. The Splendid Hotel is all white wood with red domes, inspired by a hotel from the French Riviera. Although it is a bit old now, it still has a lot of charm.

They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, plus complimentary champagne.
G. **KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel is a comfortable place in Nairobi, Africa. It is not overly fancy but is very welcoming. Many travelers stay here to rest after a safari and plan their next adventure. Guests often decide to stay longer after seeing the beautiful gardens and cozy rooms. The hotel has many trees and buildings on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city. It is a great spot to enjoy the beautiful African sunset while having a nice dinner.
H. **ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Hotel Splendido was first signed by the Duke of Windsor. Many famous people have visited, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might see wealthy guests, but the hotel still has a splendid atmosphere. It used to be a monastery and now offers simple but delicious food in the restaurant, along with beautiful Persian rugs and homemade pasta."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, things are already going wrong. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue whispers, ""She hasn't even acknowledged us. Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 
Sue expects better service because the Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for. However, the welcome is not good. The entrance from the car park is through a door with a buzzer, and the long hallway to the hotel is empty and dark. ""This is not what I expected,"" Sue says.
Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but only three are occupied that night. The room they are shown is not nice. It feels stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. 
When Sue started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and didn't think she was tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge, saying there is a blocked drain.
Sue suggests that he should not let guests go into the lounge with the smell and should guide them to another lounge instead. Greaves, who has only been at the hotel for five months, takes notes and seems unsure about Sue's advice. 
Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, for their good service and knowledge about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner is also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" 
Sue's job is to tell the hotel what is wrong, even if it is difficult. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served her apple pie with his fingers. Sometimes, she receives angry letters from people who do not like her reports. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says. 
Sue must give her findings to the hotel verbally and also write a full report. The hotels pay for her advice. Even though it is a tough job, it is worth it for the hotels with red stars. Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. However, another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems have been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says, but he does not sound very happy."
CAE_48,C1,"**Climbing the Seven Summits**
Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest mountains on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will tell his story in the order he climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave, 91 meters below the top of Mt. Everest. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, which Doug found strange since it was just the two of them. He thought it was because they were low on oxygen. Doug began talking to his own feet, feeling the cold. He remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug thought about their time on the mountain. He felt lucky to have Dougal with him, as he made Doug feel calm and confident. Doug knew he needed to find a better rhythm to reach the summit, and he did.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is known as one of the most dangerous mountains. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized how big their task was. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a new way to climb this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet, and they were both struggling. The low air pressure made it feel like they were much higher than they actually were. Finally, they reached the summit and celebrated their success.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the thick jungle on the way, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found some arrows painted on trees and a rock pool, which made them very happy. They tried to climb a steep wall but had to turn back due to falling rocks and ice. Instead, they took a safer route to the summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who suggested they join his group to climb a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to take a different path. They walked with many other climbers to the summit. The wind was strong, and they camped outside as night fell. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, which made Doug think about doing the same.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, and it is very quiet when the wind stops. On December 7, they set off for the summit. Despite strong winds and very low temperatures, they all reached the top in eight hours, although they could barely see because of the storm.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg. They arrived at the base of Elbrus and had to pay a fee to their guide. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up the mountain. They walked to a refuge and faced strong winds as they climbed. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then descended the volcano.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, they started climbing. The weather got better, and two team members went ahead while Doug and another member climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a warm welcome for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"
FCE_15,B2,"**Style Merchants**
Style is important in our lives today, from our clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares some fashion trends for this year.
**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful and romantic wedding dresses. He suggests that people should avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the overly frilly style. Instead, he recommends simpler designs. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a boy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. You don’t have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a traditional navy-blue summer suit, which has been popular with English women for many years, but he makes it look fresh and new.
**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous people wear her jewellery. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating beautiful necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds. ""I wanted a diamond at this age,"" says 36-year-old Quail, ""so I began working with them.""
**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Lily Grimson has been in the competitive fashion business for just four years, but two of her designs have been chosen for a big design exhibition. All of her handbags are handmade in the UK and are not just bags; they are stylish and glamorous, made from high-quality materials like calfskin and silk. A Grimson bag is special because of its elegance and attention to detail.
**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His goal is to make sure his clients look like they haven’t just come from a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, and there is a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home.
**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and also works as a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain and top restaurants. She has no formal training in floristry and left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements should be simple but strong, with fewer leaves. For wedding bouquets, she advises that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,B2,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**
The new five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses into a hotel. This allowed the hotel to use the latest technology for both staff and guests.
General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know the guests by name. For more details about what guests like, he uses the hotel’s computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He is happy with how well it works and the services it provides. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them when they come back. This is possible because the staff can save guests' preferences in the system.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system to help with this. Guests can change the temperature in their rooms by three degrees around the normal 18°C. If they want, the front desk can adjust the temperature anywhere between 14°C and 25°C.
Business travelers will find the technology in their rooms very useful. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have added extra cables for new technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models whenever needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this modern equipment, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are cozy and inviting. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change has many benefits for both him and the hotel. He has designed a new kitchen and improved parking. The hotel can now offer a great place to eat without financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_24,B2,"**An Eye for Detail**
Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower beds along the path have a beautiful mix of colors and shapes. This is partly because the previous owners were good gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny would say some of Susan's ideas were not worth it, but when she told him she wanted to paint them, he understood her vision.
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also enjoys watching how flowers change as they start to wilt. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they keep changing.""
Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I didn't like garden flowers back then; I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they look at home there. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t break anything. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of flowers to paint, she has found it hard to work in the garden lately. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,B2,"**No Title**
Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town center look very different, which upset some of the older residents. 
One of those upset was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. However, during the worst of the storm, when the wind knocked down a walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a big and healthy man, but for the first time, he was seriously ill with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. He thought the police needed him too much, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forget things and made him more irritable. 
Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, he was at the pharmacy getting antibiotics and then back home, where Molly sent him straight to bed. 
On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could hardly believe it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged. He was relieved to hear it was not and pulled the sheets over his head. 
On Saturday, when the antibiotics started to work and his temperature went down, he got up and realized that the loss of the walnut tree had changed how the living room looked. The Pelhams' big house was in a large garden. It was expensive, but Pelham was happy with his choice. The garden had made them feel private. 
Now, the storm had changed everything. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree. This tree did not make the room dark because there was also a window on the other wall. The tree created nice patterns of light and shadow that hid the old furniture they had brought from their last house. 
With the tree gone, the room felt too bright, showing the worn-out furniture clearly. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and pipes on the outside. It seemed to have many upstairs windows, all looking at the Pelhams. 
“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. “That’s what I’ve been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,B2,"**Living in the Valley**
We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the hills around us that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But in the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed for a longer time. Up there, the wind blew strongly. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really scare us. The river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, was what worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by the dams built many years ago.
Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was getting fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls, as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river looked wild as the water poured down towards our home. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was much deeper than we had ever seen, rushing angrily at its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its edge. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the water began to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only a little overflow sometimes. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel excited by the river's power. Thanks to the dam, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,B2,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he had written reviews for novels in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and done some work for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not mainly a journalist, so he was not very careful when choosing his team.
At first, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to make it more enjoyable. Mark felt like he was living a dream: a new newspaper, and he was part of the team. It seemed surprising that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even thought a rich person was helping him and pretending to hire him because he lacked confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground with one of his reviews, he felt very shy.
Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out as planned. They did not meet as a group, so they communicated by phone. It turned out that people preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject, so Mark chose to write about films. Without Tom's help, they would not have created the current system where Mark writes a long weekly article about one film. He enjoys this way of working. He would not want to do the usual film critic job, which means watching every new film. That routine would make him bored quickly. He would not want to sit in a screening room on a Monday morning thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?"" 
The freedom he has allows him to explore his ideas more deeply or, in a slow week, to find something interesting to say. But what is his role in the public eye? He believes people choose films based on the stars, the advertising, or the director. Some people are loyal to certain types of films, while others avoid them. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a critic's opinion. So, if a film review is not really a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark does not feel he has to be ""right"" about a movie. He does not think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present an argument. He does not see himself as a judge, and he does not want to be one."
FCE_46,B2,"**Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun.""**
**Teenager with a love for endurance sports**
**WANTED:** A sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. You should really enjoy distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (enjoying 100km rides is helpful). You must be able to do all three activities without resting.
The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. It looks tough, but what makes triathletes want to push their bodies so hard? 
Melanie Sears is a 17-year-old girl with great school results. She has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes say when asked why they compete. She explains, ""You swim 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. After the 40km bike ride, you have to run 10km, which is long when you’re tired. But it’s great fun, and it’s all worth it in the end.""
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It felt so easy that I waved at my team-mates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not do well overall. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we ended up at the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep trying. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I’m afraid that if I stop once, I might want to stop again.""
Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, while most people stop when they can’t go any further. She just kept going.""
Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That’s why I’m working very hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents to buy a £2,000 bike (it’s a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is a cost. Her tough training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she says. ""I’m not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times.""
Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says."
FCE_70,B2,"**The Collectors**
Amanda Roy talks about collecting and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults also enjoys it. Collecting is a world full of passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. But if you want to collect something, remember this: only collect things you truly love.
People have collected items for a very long time. In the past, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. This was their first way of gathering objects for personal reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells just because they are beautiful.
I have been collecting all my life. I have collected many things, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a cold and windy place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with interesting objects collected by people long ago. I was very fascinated by these items.
Many adults share my interest in collecting. One reason people collect is that it gives them control over something in their lives. For me, it is just a fun activity. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many curious items, like cups made from coconut shells and pieces of beautiful china. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings. But you don’t need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected different items, like tulip bulbs and china cups, with great determination.
I remember when I convinced another tulip collector to sell me a special tulip. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared – stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for different designs. Sadly, my collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall and saw the remains of my furniture and my collection. I was very sad about both.
I have always been interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet can make an item very valuable. As small objects become popular among collectors, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I, unfortunately, threw away both the boxes and the toys!)"
FCE_3,B2,"**My Line of Work**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I read about the exhibition topic and talk to important people to find out the main ideas and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to show. I also create interactive displays, workshops, and theatre to help the public understand the exhibition. I work with engineers and electricians to make sure everything is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, learning how to make the journeys. They find the best routes, using the right one-way streets and turns. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different way because the road is closed. This helps them think of new routes.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life in the ocean. This often changes their views because it is very different from making decisions on a computer. I am lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. However, I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money, which makes it hard to do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and that we have about 300 copies of each book we publish. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I must respond carefully. I discuss future projects and current sales with my co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is that there is too much administration work, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes to it, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. One evening, he said, ""How about this?"" and read the details. 
The summer before, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We always think it is a funny coincidence.
""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She called the rooms ""Rose,"" ""Tulip,"" ""Lily,"" and ""Geranium."" Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband takes care of repairs and decoration.
""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special, not just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good.
Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and going back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey. 
In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the cliff path to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,B2,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**
A chalet girl's work is never done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. She is busy making beds and cooking delicious dinners. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. Known as Pilch, she works in Val d'Isere, France. Here, she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University, where she studied French and History of Art. She does not see being a chalet girl as a long-term job, but rather a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a career. ""It's a good way to meet people,"" she says. ""I meet successful people every week.""
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. ""They get a full breakfast - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.""
After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because it would be bad for her work. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks are not as good.""
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""and you don’t want to cook breakfast with a headache.""
On Sunday, work starts early. Breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get ready for new guests."" If she has not done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. ""I think the mountain air affects them.""
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes guests who need ski boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she has a drink afterward, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she says."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, almost like the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press the gloves using hot brass hands that looked like they had been flattened. She called them ""pancake hands.""
Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He liked that she was interested in all the details. He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 
""Not yet,"" Rita said. 
""Well, you should visit one if you want to write about leather. I can help you arrange that. Tanneries are old-fashioned. The technology has improved, but they still look similar to how they did hundreds of years ago. It's hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries in the world. They found 6,000-year-old tanning tools in Turkey. The first clothes were just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father knows a lot about leather; you should talk to him. If you start a conversation about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers really love their work. 
""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" he asked. 
""I can't say I have,"" she replied. 
""Never seen anything made?"" 
""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" 
Seymour laughed. She made him smile. She was eager to learn, and he thought she reminded him of Marie. Marie was much taller than Rita, but they both had a bright intelligence. 
""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will take you through the whole process. Come on! We are going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.
**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. However, she has one small problem - she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning trips, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job. A chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her getting work behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.
**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because golf is his passion. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings. On average, he makes between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes on travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You are not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge, and try to understand the course,"" he explains. His skills in accounting were recognized by European Tour Productions, and they made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are important for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers.
**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to taste food at the best restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it was a good extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in my guaranteed income,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.
**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don't wake up at dawn, though. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help with that."""
FCE_66,B2,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it, there were big piles of soft sawdust. That afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored, so they climbed up to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards!"" 
His friends looked scared but eventually jumped down one by one, smiling with relief. They lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them said, ""Let's go back up and jump again."" They were not very excited, but they climbed back to the roof and started jumping off quickly. Soon, only Michael was left. His friends called up to him, ""Come on, Mike! What's wrong?"" 
Michael wanted to jump down, but he hesitated. He stood at the edge, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and take a deep breath, but he couldn't jump. His friends started laughing at him because they were tired of waiting. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't move, they began to walk away, still teasing him. 
Michael felt alone and unhappy. He stayed at the edge of the roof for a long time, watching the sun set over the lake. He was sweating from being nervous. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a while, and the yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 
As he got up slowly, he felt ashamed and wanted to avoid everyone. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time. If you won't come home, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair, always patient. But Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, hardly listened to her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job and not sure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. First, you will write a short history about yourself and then take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will get a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers, along with any retraining you might need.
I decided to try Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school during science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it wasn’t about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the tests would show who I really am. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.
After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He used my test results and our conversation to create a report with his observations and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was a bit upset to learn that I did poorly in the scientific and technical tests. I’m glad I didn’t become a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I made the right choices in journalism.
Changing your career doesn’t always mean making a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. Donna said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I had a talent for design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining in design and my financial situation,"" she explained. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her existing skills and move into a job that suited her better. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she really wanted to do. She has sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.
Some people feel they would not have made important decisions without help. Juliet Greene, 26, visited Career Counselling Services and made life-changing choices. After working at a major bank for six years, she found her job boring and wanted a new challenge. She went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed she was interested in sciences. She had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided to study geology and plans to start a degree later this year. She thinks the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the cost. Now, she feels much happier and more positive.
However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I was at a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. I got many new ideas, but I rejected them because they either meant a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had told a friend the same things, they would have given her similar advice."
FCE_22,B2,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**
If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared."" To help with this, he has tried to make a place where people feel safe. That is why he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.
This idea is surprising for many people who think of dental visits as painful or very serious. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ways to help patients relax is by using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. Patients wear the headsets during their check-up, sitting comfortably on the blue couch while watching a film about underwater wildlife. Then, the headset shows them a special camera view of their mouth.""
Most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit. Another interesting thing is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome explains, ""When people come in, I want them to feel with all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dentist smell can make people nervous.""
I found the nice smell in the office very pleasant. Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a little strange at first, but if people are relaxed, it is not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. ""I found that when you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too,"" he explains. He believes that his patient-focused approach is the start of a change towards a less formal style in British dentistry.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like a beautiful salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,B2,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a huge global business. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter, which is about eight percent of all chocolate sales for the year. Only at Christmas do people buy more chocolate. 
The large production of chocolate started in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds inside. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, but this is a mistake from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. They flavored this drink with spices for special occasions and to welcome guests. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another hundred years for the recipe to reach the rest of Europe.
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids to make milk chocolate.
At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French style. Then, in 1905, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, which was first called Dairymaid. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy milk from the English countryside, making it popular against the richer French brands.
Today, British people eat about four chocolate bars each week. This has made chocolate companies look for new ways to attract customers. One new idea is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are turned into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to attract chocolate lovers who want something different.
However, cacao farmers are still struggling because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
At 83 years old, Peter Cooke is a master of his art. He still wants to try new things, like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he focuses on what he loves: creating beautiful objects from shells. 
As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" There is a fine line between being boring and being interesting, but Peter is definitely interesting. His charm and the beauty of his creations make it easy to listen to him. 
He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them,"" he says. ""I never planned to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends told me I should have an exhibition so more people could see my art. They helped me talk to a gallery owner."" 
The exhibition in London was a success, with 70% of the pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The prices for his work are high, around £2,000 for some decorations. Cooke says he has nothing to do with the prices and is happy to share them. He believes that no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him that one day, people will want his pieces because he will stop making them.
Cooke wishes he had started this work earlier in life. He thinks he could have made even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels he can’t do as much now because he is not as strong as he used to be. However, his work is very different from the common shell items found in seaside shops. He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which helps him create boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers.
He has his own way of working and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he says about his process. The details and colors in his work look very careful and planned.
Peter travels to many places to find beautiful, tiny shells. He has been to beaches in France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines, where he lies on the sand to search for shells. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming the beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people walking on them much faster than I can collect them. The sea breaks up the shells that are left. I would never take shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" 
His argument is strong, especially when you think about how much one person can carry home, creating beauty from the shells he finds."
FCE_62,B2,"**The Schoolgirl Model**
Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who is a model. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.
The receptionist at Kira's modeling agency told me, ""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late."" I thought, ""That's okay."" I had read some bad things about models, like they can be difficult or vain. I worried that Kira might be very late or not come at all. But when Kira arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, and she was with her mother. 
Kira was not wearing fancy clothes; she had on a simple black dress and trainers. She seemed very friendly and was not selfish at all. Kira explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother looked proud of her daughter.
Kira seemed a bit confused about her sudden fame because it was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter a modeling competition. Kira said, ""I said no, but she sent some photos anyway."" When she found out she was a finalist, she was at school. This gave her the confidence to continue, and she won the competition easily. The Select model agency in London offered her work right away.
Now, Kira has to manage her two lives as a student and a model. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle because she is not a selfish person. She said, ""They think I can't stay the same just because I'm a model. The only thing that has changed is that I am more confident.""
Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day. Kira said, ""If my friends are going out, I can't promise to join them because I don’t know my schedule."" However, her friends understand and do not complain about her modeling.
Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career. Not many people can say that before finishing school. As I was ending the interview, I asked her what she would like to do if she were not a model. She thought for a moment and said, ""I’d like to do what you’re doing."""
FCE_49,B2,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**
Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the hot lands of Africa looking for valuable metals. This father and son team—one is an explorer and the other is a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. 
""As we dig, we are finding a lot of gold; now we just need to dig a bit more to reach where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. They have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold worth millions hidden in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to explore.
Since they first cleared the land and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent ten years getting permission to work from the landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a bit deeper to reach the gold.
Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it seems unlikely, but we have a few people we can contact."" As news spread about their dig, more people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and the locals are hopeful. ""If they are right, it would bring more people here,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if they find gold, I hope millions of people don’t come and dig up the hillside.""
The Welsh gold industry has declined a lot since its peak in the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines across the countryside. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"**IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, like a small car, and dives three kilometers down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
Inside the vehicle, there is very little space. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots."" They cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem and they need to get to the surface quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice journey.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor who explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where there are many underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" Black smokers are underwater volcanoes that release hot water that looks like black smoke. This water comes out at a speed of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
Rachel felt scared the first time she dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. She heard a loud bang and thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they felt incredible relief—they were still alive!
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen this."" Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her PhD, and when she finally saw them in person, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by different train schedules, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I arrived home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month.
Sleeping in a train corridor is very different from sleeping in a regular bed. The movement of the train rocks you to sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasting things, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away books after reading them. But this way of thinking is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where you can forget about common sense and just enjoy the journey. All you need is that special ticket in your hand.
This ticket lets young people travel through many countries in one day, which is amazing. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize how much we could do with this ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we soon wanted to see more countries, and there was always one more place to visit. The extra travel didn’t cost us anything.
We were interested in culture, but this was our first holiday without our parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We planned our own schedule and focused on the sights we could see easily. It was a chance to avoid guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like most other Inter-Railers who shared the train with us.
The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place you only knew by name. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it for the first time. By traveling through Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different lifestyles, you can really understand the continent. Everyone knows about these places, but it means nothing until you see them yourself. That’s why other people’s holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not show you new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people a great chance to explore it, even if it doesn’t happen right away."

Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage is missing can be very disappointing. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline finds your bags. If you are in a different climate, you may have to wear clothes that are not suitable for the weather. 
Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers at some point. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it is hard for any airline to promise that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.
Here is how it works: Airlines ask passengers to check in early, which gives enough time for bags to be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to change from one flight to another, and these times are also set longer to help with luggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause flight delays, which can lead to luggage issues. 
Human mistakes can also happen, like if a luggage tag gets torn off. These problems can be worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow.
Even busy airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have problems. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers quickly connect to flights to Latin America.
To avoid losing your luggage, try to book direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes, it is best to fly with the same airline. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight, and make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers.
If your luggage is still missing after all this, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"**The Kingfisher**
Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and different shades of yellow from the sunlight. The sound of the water is gentle, like a breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and smoothly, like a flash of light. It is gone in a moment, but its image stays in your mind because it is so powerful for such a small bird.
Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He feels a strong connection to this little bird, but he cannot explain why. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess that turned into a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became blue like the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this story. Even though kingfishers have many shades of blue, they do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are structured scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the light.
It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. Their beautiful colors and the fact that they are shy but can be watched from a distance make them very interesting. Charlie James's first hiding place was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in just a few minutes and sat only one meter away. However, it took him four more years to get his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream where kingfishers lived. Unfortunately, school took away some of his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But his passion for the kingfisher, which is the most common kingfisher in the world and the only one that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant to the editor and then became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.
Now, he wants to make the perfect kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever show."
FCE_68,B2,"**Conducting an Orchestra**
Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their experiences.
**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, wanted to learn from famous conductor Claudio Abbado in Vienna. When an assistant could not come, she stepped in to help. Later, she led her first rehearsal with Abbado. ""I wasn't nervous. I enjoy being in front of an orchestra,"" she said. Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has helped Abbado on many projects.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. He feels lucky about the timing: ""If I had won earlier, I might have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition. ""If in three years people still connect me to the competition, I will be concerned,"" he said. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting him back, which is important for his career.
**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice times needed for opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she said. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Learning from Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much bigger people, which made a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera, saying, ""There are many arguments, and you have to think about the singers' personalities.""
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting surprising but fascinating. He started as a musician in an opera house and learned from good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, which was new for him. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like,"" he said. He is grateful for all his experiences in music and performing. Now, he is open to trying different things to discover what he enjoys.
**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall quickly found himself conducting a musical in London with little notice. It was a tough start, especially when some musicians were reading newspapers during the show. ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and did my best,"" he said. He noticed that many musicians do not seem to need much guidance from a conductor. ""But I am not afraid to say what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse."" Marshall has not studied conducting formally, but he is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,B2,"**Variations on a Theme**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and nicer scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it! He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were happy to find places to relax. The park looked beautiful, and the staff were friendly. There was something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act. We tried the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is also very fun for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that waiting in line isn’t boring. It was very clean, and the staff were great. One staff member even helped me with one of the girls when I couldn’t sit with both of them.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit scared of rides, but I had fun too. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it too easy, but they loved it at their age.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we really felt that was true. The tallest roller-coaster in Europe, the Rocket, is very impressive. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters in the air, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were friendly, but some were not as welcoming. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have told the kids we were going home early!"
FCE_60,B2,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**
Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.
A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends. My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted a job I could do at home. I had worked with computers before marriage, so my husband suggested I start this business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. I was careful with my spending and always told the bank manager if I might overspend. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. My business is small, and most customers come to pick up their work.""
B. **Maggy Sasanow** designs greeting cards from her home. She says, ""I enjoy being independent. I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but when I got married, we moved to the countryside where there were no jobs like that. So, I started my own business and now I make 50 different greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. I don’t advertise; my business grows by word of mouth. People send me work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. I miss sharing ideas with others, but there are more good things than bad.""
C. **Delia Turner** has a curtain-making business that has had ups and downs. She says, ""I started my business eight years ago when it was growing. In two years, my income went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to have six full-time workers, but I had to let them go because the economy got worse. It was hard because jobs are not easy to find here. Now, I make curtains at home with my husband’s help and work with women who also work from home. I have to lower my prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.""
D. **Tessa Strickland** runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons: it was cheaper than London, and she loves the countryside. She says, ""I like being able to work when I want. Most of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at strange hours. The hard part is staying disciplined and shutting the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures and work with authors and artists. I felt lonely at first because all my experience was in London.""
E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cake business that makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home. She says, ""I am very interested in health, so I began making fruit cakes with good quality ingredients. Friends and family started asking for cakes, and soon I was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where we make all the cakes. I don’t bake anymore; I manage the business. My biggest challenge has been the financial side because we didn’t have a lot of money to start."""
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very talented in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their dad makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are schoolteachers from South Wales. When they needed to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they found it was very expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one myself."" He found a school nearby that taught instrument making and took evening classes for about three years. 
After trying to make violins and violas, John finally made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. He made me another one later, and I used it until a few months ago."" John has now retired from teaching and makes about twelve violins each year. He even sold one to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.
Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers, ""I began with the piano as soon as I could reach the keys."" He also tried the violin because his dad played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. But Paul preferred the cello after meeting the cellist in his dad's group. He thought the cellist was very cool and started taking lessons.
Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive but not pushy. I wanted to follow in Paul's footsteps."" Huw is now making a name for himself as a pianist and composer.
Paul has done very well with the cello his dad made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20 years old, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a different cello, which is very old and on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 
Paul will soon perform on television, playing Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says, ""I will always play it my way."" However, he cannot watch himself on TV because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,B2,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**
The National Trust is an organization that works to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who helps take care of the beautiful areas owned by the Trust.
Gareth believes that a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. He often works with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. Many people wanted the job of National Trust Warden, but Gareth got it because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand the farmers' problems. He says, ""They can't trick me!"" His farming background also helps him with the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was younger. He now realizes that farming has changed the countryside, but it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government rules.
When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted things done their way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. Gareth says, ""We are close to finding a way to work together.""
Gareth's job includes conservation, allowing the public to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. He wants to finish projects efficiently and enjoys seeing them completed. However, he spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.
Gareth loves his job and enjoys talking to the public, although some visitors can be difficult. He says, ""Some people come in, demand things, and leave as if they own the place. It can be frustrating to be nice to them!"" But Gareth believes that common sense is important.
If you have common sense and like working outdoors, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. However, there may not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus so much on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have support from home, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are playing at home. People expect us to start the tournament well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be fun to play against because they are very skilled."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. In the Championships, you only have one chance, so you must be ready.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard to lose. But after the game, we are all friends again."" 
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is important for us to think and train like world-class players. As captain, I need to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I want to support and encourage my team.""
Kendra explained, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned everything carefully. I decided that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
How can parents help a child with great musical talent? It can be hard to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents might not see their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and acts out. While most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math and English, musically talented children need special support that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is not a main focus.
Children who are musically gifted, and those whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, can benefit from attending a specialist music school. There are five of these schools in Britain, and they are relatively new. They provide a friendly environment for children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians.
At specialist music schools, children spend a lot of time on music activities. They have individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), play in orchestras and chamber groups, and receive voice training and music theory lessons. They also practice in private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their day includes a limited academic program that focuses on important subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. Students can also study more subjects if they want.
All five British specialist music schools are independent, meaning they are not funded by the government. Classes are small, with more teachers available for each student. Most children at these schools live there full-time, which allows them to spend their formative years with others who share their interests.
However, there are some downsides. One major issue is the cost; fees can be high (between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for boarders). Each school tries to help parents with scholarships and financial aid for very talented children. Also, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools worry about admitting children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They want to help children grow into well-rounded individuals.
It is true that separating musically gifted children from a young age can cause stress. Some children may lose their musical talent during their teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help when needed.
Most former students of music schools feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, but many also worry about the limited academic program, which is less important than music. Many musically talented young people are also very smart and can handle academic challenges. They may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.
For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before considering a specialist music education. Children who are also academically gifted can do well in regular schools with good music programs or by combining regular school with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, as well as opportunities to play in orchestras and chamber music groups. However, this option may not be possible for families living far from London or other big cities."
FCE_25,B2,"**An Eye for Detail**
Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower beds along the path have a beautiful mix of colors and shapes. This is partly because the previous owners were good gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny would say some of Susan's ideas were not worth it, but when she told him she wanted to paint them, he understood her vision.
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set the whole thing up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also enjoys watching how flowers change as they start to wilt. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they keep changing.""
Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I didn't like garden flowers back then; I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic flowers. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they look at home in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t break anything. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of flowers to paint, she has found it hard to work in the garden lately. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,B2,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**
A chalet girl's work is never done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. She is busy making beds and cooking delicious dinners. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. Known as Pilch, she works in Val d'Isère, France. Her job is to cook and clean for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah graduated from Oxford Brookes University last summer, where she studied French and History of Art. She thinks being a chalet girl is not a long-term career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more serious job. ""It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful guests every week,"" she says.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. ""They get a full breakfast - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.
Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because she says it is not good to sleep before dinner. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she says. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks are not as good for different reasons.""
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, Sarah does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""when you don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired.""
On Sundays, work starts earlier. Breakfast for the guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get ready for the next guests."" If she has not done the shopping for the week on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. ""I think the mountain air affects them,"" she jokes.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. One day, she worked at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my clothes for Marie Claire was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but here I was rushing around when I could be quietly cuddling an animal. Some people on the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job at the zoo is not very stressful. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I find it interesting to see how magazines work, but I really love my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""
Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I was petting an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""
Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight at work. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn’t expect gardening to be so hard or need so much planning. I enjoy gardening, but I don’t plan to quit my nursing job.""
Charlie Dimmock is a landscape gardener on Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would faint during some tasks, but I surprised myself and felt fine. The nurses are very friendly, and it felt very different from my usual job with men. I think my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but it made me feel good.""
Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and when I put it on, I felt different—people looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone has a heart attack, which I knew from my training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt shy. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""
Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses the border into Italy. It takes you past beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of rich and famous people. The passengers are always lively because there is a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the amazing trip.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with my aunt. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I ever saw, and its big glass roof amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am very thankful for one train in particular: the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was lovely as we traveled through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were writing articles about a trip around the world and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There were no roads, so we had to take the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would wait for days if people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train went through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling on the moon.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but that’s not true for me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old train line that volunteers had taken care of. That’s when my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

If you want to publish your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" 
First, you need to research where to send your work. This means learning about different publishers and improving your writing skills. To sell your writing, you need to understand the publishing world. No matter what you write, you should know the markets you want to reach. 
One of the best ways to learn about these markets is to read a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading different materials will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are looking for. Remember, this information changes often because new magazines and books come out all the time. 
If you are unsure about what to write, let’s say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories. This market is quite small now, so get recent copies of those magazines. Look at the types of stories they buy and who their readers are. Readers have different expectations, and editors want to meet those needs.
Sometimes, new writers send me their stories and say, ""This has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I don’t want to discourage anyone, but it is likely that their work is not ready for publishing. Many new writers are too quick to send out their work before it is good enough. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. 
When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been writing for years before they got published. When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. This will help you become more confident and fluent in your writing. 
Don’t throw away any of your stories; instead, try to improve them. Also, I suggest not showing your work to others in the beginning. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 
Do everything you can to grow as a writer. Look for a creative writing course near you, or join a local writers' group. This will help you gain ideas and confidence by meeting other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore train station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people there than I expected. The station didn’t feel as nice as usual. Older couples with matching bags filled the benches, and many college students had left their bags on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different people. He looked well-off with his tanned skin and nice clothes. 
He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but to New York. He thanked her and moved on. I was interested in what he was doing. He then asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to Wilmington. He kept walking to a couple with matching luggage. 
I moved closer, thinking he could have asked me too. I understood why he didn’t; he probably thought I looked unreliable. He quickly glanced at me and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed now. 
“Please!” he said to a woman reading a book. “Tell me you’re going to Philadelphia!” She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five. “Philadelphia?” she said. “Yes, I am.” 
“Could I ask you a favor?” I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell the woman was becoming cautious. The man noticed too and said, “Nothing too difficult, I promise!” 
They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man began to explain, “My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, went shopping, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said ‘hello’ to me. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia. She didn’t know what to do.” 
The woman listened sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet to see where this was going. “I told her to stay at the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport.” 
I thought it was strange. If it was such an emergency, why didn’t he go himself? The woman asked him, “Why don’t you go yourself?” He replied, “I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair.” I thought this was a weak excuse. 
I looked at them again. The man was holding a padded envelope, not a plain one, which would have made more sense. A padded envelope hides what’s inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. I thought silently, “Be careful, lady.”"
FCE_30,B2,"**Gary and Me**
John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, talks about his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. His chance was to run a restaurant, and Gary's chance was to cook. When John found out about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was perfect for his plans.
Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembered how his mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad when he was left alone. Because of this, he wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of their children and managed the finances while he ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made time to eat together as a family. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.
Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which gave him plenty of money at school. He was very disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could cook over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time to be successful. John told him, ""If you want to achieve something in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. After that, it’s harder.""
At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats. He finished his work in an hour and even helped others. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that if you want something, you must work hard for it because nothing is given for free. Gary has seen his chance and taken it.
As parents, we talk to our children as they grow up. If they remember even a little of what we say, we should be happy. John thinks that Gary must have listened sometimes because of the things he says and does."
FCE_7,B2,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is through personal contacts. If you know someone who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have any contacts. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin felt very new and unknown. She didn’t think about why she was going there. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They all wanted to escape and see more of life. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm because hostels are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn’t know they were talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her job at the post office and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.
There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. As Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. ""Desperate place,"" she said. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""
Jo continued up and met another girl named Nessa. Nessa said, ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" Jo asked what she did. Nessa replied, ""She just looked around and acted like it was terrible, speaking in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 
Pauline, who had colorful clothes and bright hair, was a punk. Jo was surprised because she had seen punks on the street but never talked to one. ""I’m Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa invited Jo to have tea with them. She brought out three mugs: one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one with ""Other."" ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,B2,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of dolphin populations.
Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, can feel human emotions, and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. Our love for dolphins has grown because of TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected by laws and cared for in special marine areas. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a major wildlife disaster.
There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are seen in small groups. We know very little about them. 
Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen often near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress, like skin injuries.
It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is a big problem. It reduces the number of fish in the ocean, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are taken from one area, they may not have enough time to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. 
In modern fishing, large nets are often left in the water or pulled quickly through the sea. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.
Dolphins can also store harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in dolphins because they are fat-soluble. This means that when female dolphins produce milk, it can contain high levels of these poisons, which can harm their young. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.
Another serious threat to dolphins is noise pollution caused by humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their environment. In the ocean, noise travels much better than in the air. This noise from ships and oil wells may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of reading about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.
Exercise helps improve your muscles and can change your body shape quickly. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit better. It can also prevent injuries by fixing muscle imbalances. Exercise can quickly improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.
You may have heard many reasons to exercise before, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can help you sleep better. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some health problems. 
If you still need convincing, just remember that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to push yourself too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. If you are unsure about what is best for you, talk to your doctor.
Good posture is very important. If you don’t have good posture, exercise won’t help you change your body shape. Good posture makes you look and feel better. If you tend to slouch, think of a balloon pulling the top of your head up. This can help you stand taller and breathe better. It also makes your body look slimmer.
Stretching is also important. It helps you move easily and keeps your posture correct. Stretching can prevent injuries from overuse. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. 
A good exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, a workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,B2,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**
What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it can be very hard to find them. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost non-stop rain. This has caused many problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Together, they have made some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a popular film about leopards. While that film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.
Traveling film-makers have been moving around the world to film exotic wildlife since television started. I talked to Newman while he was having a rare meeting with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have some arguments, but we get over them quickly."" Neither of them thinks of themselves as the leader. They get along well because they both see the animals in a similar way. 
When they travel, they usually set up their tents each night. But now, they are working from a fixed camp. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before to keep it warm. Their meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. Newman said, ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be a bit stressful."" 
It can be tough living in remote areas, but it allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would often go off alone, but when she returned, she would greet all the other lions, and eventually, she would greet their car too.
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they began working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in one location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. 
Newman said, ""Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start because we shared the same ideas and vision. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training place. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus so much on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be very fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure. The crowd will have expectations and support us. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""
Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but it will still be exciting to play because Barbados has talented players. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra knows the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but in the Championships, you only have one chance, and you must be ready.""
In the fifteen years Kendra has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive now. ""You don’t train hard to lose,"" Kendra says. But after the game, everyone is friendly. 
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. ""It is important that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explains. As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mindset and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,B2,"**In Hot Water**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, and dives three kilometers down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
Inside the vehicle, Rachel says, ""There is very little space. I can touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.""
""If there is a problem and we need to get to the surface quickly, we can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out, and it goes up to the surface very fast. No one has tested it yet, but I think it would not be a nice trip.""
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor. He explained what to do in an emergency, even if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space.
Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. ""We went to a place that was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, are many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. This is where the Atlantic Ocean is very active. The Russian team was leaving some scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at a speed of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""
""The only time I was scared was when I first dived with an American team. We were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we were so relieved - we were still alive!""
""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time I look out of the window and see the chimneys, I feel amazed. I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I finally saw them in real life, it was an incredible feeling."""
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make judgments about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and the words we use.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she didn’t want to be late because she believes it is important to be on time. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who works at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn’t take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. Many people think that what is inside matters most, but in an interview, you should try to present yourself in the best way possible.
Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her that she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work was good and that her clothes should not matter.
Movement and gestures also affect how an interviewer sees a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our words and facial expressions send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. So, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview. She was offered the job right away. However, she was too excited and showed too much enthusiasm. The boss realized she would not turn down the offer, so he gave her a lower salary than she wanted. She believes she could have negotiated for a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can help you understand the company better. Mentioning something that interests you during the interview can show your interest in the company.
Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and key points."""

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the City, it became boring. No one was having fun anymore. I didn’t plan to leave my job yet, but then I lost it unexpectedly. I didn’t get a lot of money when I left, but it was enough to start my farm. My big chance came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, my work hours are still long, about 80 to 90 hours a week, and I’m still selling a product.""
**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He says, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to leave my job and become an artist. A career counselor helped me a lot. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are grown, so we didn’t need to worry about money. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. It was hard to leave our friends, but we are lucky that they still visit us.""
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot, but the hours were very long. I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Many people thought I would get bored, but I never did. The key is to have deadlines. In fashion, there are always new collections and designs to work on, so I stay busy. I feel happier now and less stressed. However, I miss talking to colleagues. What I love about my job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when it’s your name on the product, you care even more.""
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He says, ""I worked in finance since I was 22, making deals. I liked the excitement, but I didn’t find it rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year instead. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life. That is the best part."""
FCE_6,B2,"**Dedicated to Their Sports**
Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
**A Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there because the facilities are great and the nightlife is exciting. However, I have to be very disciplined. If my friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but being dedicated is important in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics - that would be amazing.
**B Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn. To succeed, I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I love sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it is worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice trip. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship allowed me to present a surfing series on TV. Now, I guess I am a bit of a celebrity.
**C Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and always celebrate our wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we do not seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so it is nice to come back and spend time with my friends who do different things. You cannot focus on the sport all the time; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but I am rarely recognized in public. I would not like to be a celebrity. I do get nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.
**D Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd's support. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports; you need to be serious and professional. I try not to let it bother me too much. I want to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make their own choices. I just can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed at children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big part of this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things. Arguments about how bad sugar is for teeth are not convincing when compared to the fun and emotional ads they see.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when talking about food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests. ""My son pays attention to ads, but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent in their responses to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because we say they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I’m in a good mood, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money because their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers."
FCE_20,B2,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**
The new five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses into a hotel. This allowed the hotel to use the latest technology for both staff and guests.
General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know the guests by name. For more details about what guests like, he uses the hotel’s computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He is very happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them when they come back. This is possible because the staff can save guests' preferences in the system.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system that lets guests control the temperature in their rooms. They can change it by three degrees around the normal temperature of 18°C. If they want, the front desk can adjust the temperature anywhere between 14°C and 25°C.
Business guests will find the technology in their rooms very useful. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have added extra cables for new technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models whenever needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this modern technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are cozy and welcoming. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move has many benefits for both him and the hotel. He has designed a new kitchen and improved parking. The hotel can now offer a great place to eat without financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_40,B2,"**Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully how they find their energy.
A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need to do things that challenge me. When I learn something new, I feel very energized. I also love rhythm; right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. Dance is amazing and gives me energy. If I am bored, I feel tired and think life is not worth it. Doing something meaningful, even in a small way, gives me energy.""
B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I love being at work, so it doesn’t feel like a burden. If you enjoy what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need enough sleep, and when I get it, I feel great. If I only sleep six hours, I feel a bit tired. I know exercise gives me energy, but sometimes it’s hard to find the energy to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to exercise at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""
C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat very healthily for energy; I think it comes from being enthusiastic and positive. I don’t like negative people. I believe we should enjoy our lives and have fun. It’s important to achieve things and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many lively young people, which energizes me. I enjoy taking photos, even if I’m not great at it. I also write lyrics for fun, which helps me relax when I travel a lot.""
D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do, both at work and at home with my family. Being positive helps a lot. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Energy is like a natural feeling that comes from talking to others. Just smile at someone and see how good it feels when they smile back. It’s much better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a strict exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""
E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is creating a garden from a wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden. It was better than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing gives me energy too. I also enjoy sneaking into a farmer's land or a forest. If someone catches me, I say, 'Oh, what a lovely place! I didn’t know it was private.' I like this because it feels playful.""
F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe you should care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don’t want to do can make you tired. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like how they took my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but in the 1924 Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie showed a more athletic way of skating. This made skating very popular. 
Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and challenging. For beginners, balance and control are very important, and you can only go faster as you get better. The way you position your body helps with balance. Your legs should be slightly bent, and your knees should be relaxed. This helps keep your weight centered and your body leaning slightly forward. 
Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. When you push forward with one foot, make a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you practice this for a while, you can slowly make bigger movements as you improve. 
Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should know. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up. 
Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have instructors who can help you learn the basic moves, turns, jumps, and spins of freestyle skating.
If you watch good skaters, you will see how relaxed and smooth they are. To skate well, you should practice exercises regularly. It can be dangerous to skate if your body is stiff, so warm-up exercises are important. These should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also helps your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. When combined with swimming or jogging, skating is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can bring tears of joy. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the good and bad parts of their lives.
A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Right now, the training is very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes your body stiff.""
B. **Annika's mother** says, ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen other parents push their kids, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika’s level takes a lot of time and energy, so you have to want to do it. People often say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""
C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at age 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love it! Even if my parents weren’t there, I would still do it because I am very determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. **Sarah's mother** says, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she loved it. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is happiest on a horse and knows what to do. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about being proud; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""
F. **Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it right away. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. I’m happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is so talented. If she has this gift, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,B2,"
It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 
Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe increases by one centimeter. More tall people are being born each year. However, this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are starting to lose the effects of many years of poor diet, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are beginning to reach our true potential. We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""
For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Many natural areas were taken over by farms, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories people eat today. This poor diet has harmed human health. 
Over the years, we have mostly eaten soups, porridges, and breads, which have left us underfed. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be good, actually caused health problems. 
Despite this, farming spread because one piece of land could feed ten times more people than hunting could. Many people who rely on farming are still not well-nourished. Only recently have wealthier countries started to improve their diets. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are becoming more like those of our ancestors. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has its own problems. 
Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Also, legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products often. The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University thinks it could be around 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. 
However, scientists say that while some people are getting taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. As the planet continues to warm, we might get even smaller. In other words, our growth could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,B2,"**Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think that studio audiences are not very important. I have heard that even people who work in television do not think highly of them. One cameraman even said they are treated ""like cattle."" I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people who wanted a moment of fame. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different types of people for different programs.
Many of us who watch television at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on television for a moment. I did not believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""
Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you do what the signs say. This is true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.""
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte liked being part of live television. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching the show on a monitor.
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For most people in the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes that have no human touch. I prefer places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn’t cost much more than regular tickets. The views are not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a chair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look more closely and find something new.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the beauty of the sea. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into the beautiful valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple self-catering place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is great for hiking. There are not many people living or visiting there. It is a quiet and remote area, and I love the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, and romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**
We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she found a beautiful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked excitedly. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank ready for animals like this, so we could admire it and look it up in our natural history book.
I got home late and quickly put a pot on the stove. Suddenly, I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their bedroom. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, the white mouse I got for Mother's Day. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room, trying to escape with his catch. 
I jumped into the chaos and tripped over something, falling to the floor. While I was thinking about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake. It had escaped and was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat were jumping around, making a lot of noise. The dog was barking too. 
In the kitchen, the pot boiled over, so I quickly turned off the gas and went back to help. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and pulled the small, wet mouse from his mouth. Surprisingly, the mouse was okay. Domino caught the same mouse three more times in its life, but it eventually died of old age.
Feeling good about saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It seemed strong and I knew it would be hard to catch. I sat on the floor, trying to calm the snake down. Slowly, it relaxed and rested its head on its body, but it still looked suspicious. I carefully lifted the snake and stood up. I walked to the end of the garden and pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would go there.
When I finally let go of the snake's head, I expected it to bite me, but instead, it slid over my shoulders like a colorful scarf. We stood there in the evening light, with my four children, me, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, broke the silence and said, ""Mum, you are nice and warm, and the shed isn’t.""
I asked the kids to help me encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did. Without looking back, it climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"**Drop Me a Line!**
In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old way of writing letters is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by any other way of communicating. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who it is from, and happiness in reading what it says.
I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back to me. Sometimes my father wrote long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters from home talked about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch by writing. Writing letters actually helped our relationships. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than by talking.
I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a whole year’s worth of news! I love receiving letters in airmail envelopes with beautiful stamps. I get letters from friends in different countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. There is also a lady from France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant after a holiday, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited each other’s homes.
My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our friendship lasted so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it!
I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."
FCE_54,B2,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**
Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at a famous tourist site in France are being slowly destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain is believed to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include pictures of cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.
Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues like this, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. He explains that when people cannot take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer. The drawings are already polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors cannot see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look newer.
Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, the director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He says that if this does not happen, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.
Clottes disagrees with this idea. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is very strict, and while it may work, it will also upset local people."" He reminds us that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect it.
David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea is not perfect. Our department believes that people should be able to see the site, but it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. I would like everyone to visit, but the main problem is money. We do not have enough funds to hire enough guards. We may need to think about charging a fee since there is no chance of getting government funding.""
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also studied the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—since tourists can now avoid a long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to block off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't happen because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""It feels like a battle. They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and when I give in, I feel guilty for buying them unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry they are missing out on learning how to make choices. I just can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed at children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big part of this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things. Arguments about how bad sugar is for their teeth do not work well against the fun and persuasive ads they see.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb explains, ""The goal of advertising is to convince people to buy products. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when talking about food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests. ""My son pays attention to ads, but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because we say they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I’m in a good mood, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money because their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"**Going Up the Wall**
In the past, climbers went to the mountains to climb. Now, people can climb in many places, both indoors and outdoors. A crowd watches in excitement as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new technology that is developing quickly.
Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid getting bored.
Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls using special bricks. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had some problems. These walls could only be straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers would get tired of the same routes.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the rocks on cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to make climbing walls with steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for making overhanging walls without a lot of work, but steel frames could be built anywhere. This system allowed climbers to have many different holds to choose from."
FCE_61,B2,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**
If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is a risky choice. Acting is indeed a risky career because there are many actors but not enough jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some of your friends might think you are making a bad choice, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. 
Choosing to be an actor is a personal decision, and you are responsible for your own path and dreams. There are no easy ways to succeed in acting. There are no tests to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee you will get a job. Success depends on both luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes good rewards.
Many people want to know what talent is. I think talent is a mix of natural skill and imagination, which is hard to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. 
Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. 
When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often don’t have a clear answer. They know some things about their skills and techniques, but they also understand that their success can change quickly. 
Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been without work, doing other jobs like selling clothes or waiting tables. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid talking about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. 
No one likes to be rejected. This possibility is there from the moment you start auditioning. You are saying you are ready, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, your success depends on how much you care about acting. If you don’t care enough, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 
Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe increases by one centimeter. More tall people are being born each year. However, this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are starting to lose the effects of many years of poor diet, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again, the people who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.""
For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Many natural areas were taken over by farms, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories people eat today. This poor diet has harmed human health. 
Over the years, we have mostly eaten soups, porridges, and breads, which have left us underfed. In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Some anthropologists say corn was not a good thing for health. 
However, farming spread because one piece of land could feed ten times more people than hunting could. Many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only recently have wealthier countries started to improve their diets. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are becoming more like those of our ancestors. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has its own problems. 
Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Also, legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products often. The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University thinks it could be around 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. 
But scientists say that while some people are getting taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. As the planet continues to warm, we might get even smaller. So, the growth of humans could be affected by global warming."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the City, it became boring. No one was having fun anymore. I didn’t plan to leave my job yet, but then I lost it unexpectedly. I didn’t get a lot of money when I left, but it was enough to start my farm. My big chance came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, my work hours are still long, about 80 to 90 hours a week, and I’m still selling a product.""
**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He says, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to leave my job and become an artist. A career counselor helped me a lot. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are grown, so we didn’t need to worry about money. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends, but we are lucky that they still visit us.""
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot, but the hours were very long. I didn’t want to work more and more, so I left. Many people thought I would get bored, but I never did. The key is to have deadlines. In fashion, there are always new collections and designs to work on, so I stay busy. I feel happier now and less stressed, but I miss talking to colleagues. I love being responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when it’s your name on the product, you care even more.""
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He says, ""I worked in finance since I was 22, making deals. I liked the excitement, but I didn’t find it rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I feel in control of my life now, and that is the best part."""
FCE_5,B2,"**A Winning Game**
Two brothers have found that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, playing a game called pichenotte. They say this game is special. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, who was a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played pichenotte and had a lot of fun. 
Later, the family moved to New Mexico, but they still remembered their grandfather's pichenotte board, which he made from old wooden crates. When visitors came over, they were often curious because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed that their old pichenotte board was damaged, so he decided to make a new one. The new board looked great. A relative saw it and wanted one, and then a friend wanted one too. 
To see how popular the game was, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. Dave said, ""People started to watch and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon, they couldn't get up from the table!"" When people asked about the game's history, Dave did some research. He found out that the game likely started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game changed into 'squails' in Britain, and British people brought it to Canada. The French-Canadian version is called pichenotte.
Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks', which they flick across a round board using their fingers. If a puck goes into a small hole, it is worth 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game has eight small posts that make it harder to play. A game usually lasts about two minutes.
When the brothers saw how much people liked the game at the bar, they made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people came to buy them, and the game became more popular. Soon, they started having championships and created a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. As more people learned about the game, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time job. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12 kg, and is 1 cm thick. Norm said, ""They're very strong because they need to last a long time."" 
The boards are sold for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows about the game yet, but the brothers hope that one day they will be able to buy a luxury car instead of using their garage for making boards. For now, they enjoy playing the game that they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a piece of empty land, covered in weeds. For a long time, people thought it was useless. But one man, with the help of his wife, worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful village you see today. 
Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the lovely landscape you see now. Bulldozers and digging machines helped, but a lot of hard work was also done by hand. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. 
In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and bushes were planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they needed to survive near the sea and withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.
The whole village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by hand over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastic to resist all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how to choose the right materials, but soon he became an expert himself.
You will notice that everything is built to the same scale, and even the smallest details are carefully made. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality and good maintenance. The methods used here have been copied in other model villages in England and even taught in some colleges.
All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, which is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It is inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. 
As you walk around the village, you will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition. Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; if you accidentally break something, it can take us a long time to fix it. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.
To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if you saw any models that need improvement. We are always updating the models and need your feedback.
We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don’t forget to tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. While some pop stars do take pictures with paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. Most of the time, it hurts public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle these problems. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help keep people safe? The actress has complained about long-distance photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. The PCC should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these unfair attacks?
This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers would report on this, and it would be shown on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected, as they would not be able to afford to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore. If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be some problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it talk to the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still did not want to do anything, should the PCC still act? Also, celebrities and royals might expect the PCC to take action on stories about them, and they could be upset if it does not happen. 
The job of the PCC is very big. How could it monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They could have a worse story that they do not want to be made public if they complain. In this way, the PCC might become a problem for them too. 
One British comedian faced issues with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, and he also did not complain when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, saying they thought it was just a joke and that he, being a comedian, would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

We are not talking about people who want a temporary job while looking for a permanent one or those who leave a job they don’t like after a few weeks. Instead, we focus on those who are ready to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and have an idea of what you want to do next.
What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to a job with more responsibility, or change to a different field. Whatever you choose, it is important to pick your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years. Future employers will look closely at this job when you apply for your next one. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow, develop your skills, and give you more responsibilities.
If you want to travel, now might be a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and then find your second job. Employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again soon.
Juliette Davidson spent her first year after college working for three lawyers. It was a good first job because they were supportive.

FCE_17,B2,"'Confident People: What's Their Secret?'**
Confident people seem like they were born that way, but most say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very anxious, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life and helped me become more outgoing.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to calm those fears.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to look confident because it is important in my job in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel tense in important situations. We feel better when we talk to friendly people. My mother once told me that everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to notice me. I remember this advice often. I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.
**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone will like you. You need to accept yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped my self-esteem. Setting small goals helps too. It feels good to achieve something instead of trying to do everything at once and ending up with nothing.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I was very nervous about speaking in public. I told myself that many people do this every day, so I could too. I also found it helpful to write down some notes to help me feel more secure. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,B2,"**Visit to Malaysia**
Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional - if the line breaks, finders keepers... and anyway, I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All the kites were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat down in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and looked at Malaysia's biggest kite festival.
In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A line of nervous competitors held the lines of their kites and waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs, which were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and how well they flew. 
""Flying kites isn't so difficult,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how to do it."" I received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, nice room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through beautiful mountains covered in rainforest.
I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that pointed up a path into the forest and said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started walking, it would have been good to know that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the campsite, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He took care of a kitchen and a few bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects under my thin mattress. 
At night, it was very dark and full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and made noise. In the morning, there was a great view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the trees. A moment later, I was soaked. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the big drops. I also worried about my car getting washed away (it sometimes happens) and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill.
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of its people."

I. **Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
""I don’t like shopping much, maybe because I work in the city and the shops don’t interest me anymore. When I have to shop, I go but don’t try things on because it’s too much trouble.
