CPE_15,"**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is similar. Rubbish bags or bins are picked up regularly by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. 

The cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfills. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A possible solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to recycle.

However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging households for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that residents had to attach to their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags were picked up during collection.

In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seemed like a good use of market forces, the authors concluded that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the workers running the program. 

Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people crammed more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfills. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs, only fell by 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing scheme, the weight also fell by 3.5%.

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already recycling voluntarily.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount collected, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts the amount of rubbish by 0.3%. This is lower than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.

If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, richer towns tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time for recycling. 

Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily. Free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,"**Work and Change: Theodore Zeldin's Ideas**

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change in the future. Do you feel respected and appreciated in your job? Simply being successful in your career is not enough anymore. Many people in different professions feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even those who are famous often feel unhappy despite their success. 

In the past, loving your job was enough to make you feel special. Now, you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, then no amount of money or status can make up for that. 

Zeldin wants to find ways for work to focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful life, help us discover new talents, and connect us with more people. However, changing this will not automatically solve unemployment. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.

Even traditional professions, like doctors and accountants, are facing challenges. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and middle managers are losing their confidence. At the same time, companies and organizations are becoming smaller. 

In Britain, only 8% of employees feel that their values match those of their organizations. Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they shape people’s lives. He is also looking at important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, he is focusing on finding better ways to earn a living.

Many experts work to improve the profits of companies, but we also need to think about ourselves as human beings and the kind of people we want to work with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us feel trapped in our jobs, unable to escape because of our qualifications and careers?

For example, in the hospitality industry, which employs 10% of the workforce, many talented people work in low-paying jobs with little respect. Hotels could be more than just places for travelers to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and connect. Hotel staff, many of whom are foreigners, often have only superficial interactions with guests. 

If hotels paid attention to their employees' ambitions, they could offer more services and create a better experience for everyone. However, they are often limited by financial concerns, focusing only on making profits. 

Zeldin believes that work is about relationships. Many people want to work in a way that allows them to express their independence. They should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues. This requires good communication skills, which are different from traditional conversations. 

Real conversations create a bond of respect and help us understand each other better. They are important for establishing equality. Every meaningful conversation can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a good outcome if conditions are right. The metaphor assumes there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Television, as a technology, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was designed to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were some lesser-known alternatives to this centralized model that are worth mentioning. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateurs were active in this field. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards for television equipment and channel regulations that pushed these grassroots innovators out. This marked the end of a chance for television to develop as a more democratic form of communication in Britain.

Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the deep structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly used for public entertainment in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, most people in Britain and Germany experienced television in public settings rather than at home.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed. Instead, television systems based on public viewing were operating in several countries in the 1930s. However, manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of having a fully equipped home for entertainment became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.

There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, there was more centralization of power and capital, and traditional communities broke apart, leading to new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which made them feel more isolated compared to those in stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of community within the nation-state.

However, broadcasting can also be seen positively as a social form that supports democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is changing, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain centralized period of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when wanting more things becomes too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. We often hear messages like, ""If you don’t have this, you are not as good as others."" To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in ways we don’t even notice. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research centers and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living things. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature that makes us curious and eager to learn more. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in places where caves affect our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, helped create the field of meteorology, which has developed into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated math problems much faster than humans. Meteorology uses many technical terms that can be hard to understand for non-professionals. However, human experience is still very important in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly about theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is primarily about music, and theatre comes second. This makes sense, but I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.

At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are amazed by the talent of the musicians. A skilled singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event; we know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of actors and may not be impressed by performances that seem similar to what they could do themselves. They usually do not ask how actors remember their lines, even after a long and difficult speech. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; in fact, many people enjoy both. It suggests that audiences and performers are on more equal ground in theatre than in music, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question is whether music can learn anything from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can, especially because I have seen how a different approach can improve the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, filled with passion, humor, sadness, and intimacy. It can connect with the audience's imagination, both individually and as a group. However, the traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and showing great respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes interrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can disrupt the flow of the entire performance. 

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a wonderful event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in different locations within a cathedral and then moved into the town. It was a high-quality musical experience where the skills and generosity of the professional musicians were central, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.

What I hope for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations. This can create surprising effects for both performers and audiences. Sometimes, this means giving up comfort; the sound might not be perfect, or it could be a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be brave as they follow artists into unexpected places.

I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that something should change in how we experience music. I can only speak as a fan: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can enjoying music. I want both to thrive and for more people to experience the joy I feel as an audience member."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I don’t really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly a problem that gets in the way between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can hide important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off you. For days, you will find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand.

**Lock and Key**  
The need for a safe home, privacy, and security has been important since people first built houses. The simple lock on a door has changed to electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations. However, people still want to keep out the “bad guys.” The idea of a lock and key is partly about feeling safe. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locks that work with smart cards. But many people do not like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of using a real key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic lock, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, art is not just about understanding; it’s about how it makes you feel. This idea is great, but it hasn’t worked for me in the past. The new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explain the artwork and its meaning. Instead of just looking at the pictures without understanding, these helpful labels made it easier for me to appreciate the art."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films usually means reducing, condensing, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It is about how each medium captures the audience's attention and the type of repetition they use.

In a novel, repetition can include reminding readers of a character's traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help readers understand better. In dialogue, we can often guess who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. Stage plays mostly consist of speech and often imitate real conversations, sometimes to the point where the dialogue seems repetitive and does not clearly communicate anything.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, people can feel completely absorbed in the film's world. It is an experience that takes them away from reality, at least for the duration of the film. However, when the lights come back on, the experience ends, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel responsible for the time spent watching the film, and this sense of unreality can make it hard to take movies seriously. Many from older generations, including our teachers, did not see movies as art but rather as ""mere entertainment."" They enjoyed being entertained but did not value films as an art form.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable places like the Script Department. Most rooms looked the same and were used for both official and unofficial meetings. It was hard to find a specific room without help. The studio had three main entrances, but none provided clear guidance for newcomers. Most people who worked there knew their way around, and it was assumed that they could navigate the confusing space. Thanks to their teamwork, stories of romance and adventure could reach audiences everywhere, allowing couples like Jane and George or Sally and Dick to escape their everyday lives for a few hours.

**Film-Makers**

It seems that almost everyone wants to make a movie. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and many universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that give away cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched his career as an independent director. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to make his breakthrough film before he turned 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.

In the past, when studios were in control, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers before directing their own films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to go their own way."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old homes made of orange brick or pale white plaster. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from a nearby factory filled the air, making it unpleasant to be outside. One common sight in that part of Norwich in the morning was a paperboy making a face as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses in the distance. 

I also have memories of my mother, who was ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and of snow falling on a big mansion at Earlham. My mother appears in these early memories, and I remember her as a small, precise woman who was often angry. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to small shops or into the city, I sensed that she was a very lonely person, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

My mother had strict ideas about how to behave, which were not common in our neighborhood. This sometimes led to intense cleaning sessions or her telling me to ""behave properly."" I found it hard to understand her rules. For example, it meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or risking their rose bushes when walking down the street. It also meant sitting quietly at the dining table for long periods, listening to radio shows she liked. There were many rules like this.

Over time, I noticed other people in our lives. Despite her loneliness, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize they were not great company. They often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I belonged to.

I felt a heavy weight from the houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly."" It felt like my job to grow up and free myself from this weight, but it was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a clear pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and bothered your parents. I remember long, boring days playing on a rug while my mother sat in a chair, cold and distant. Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers with bikes, but mine usually let me walk with other children.

If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays. During those days, I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were just trying to take our money. She often talked about how people were only interested in money, and she had a very low opinion of politicians.

I might be exaggerating or ignoring her good qualities, but my mother did not show much kindness. However, she was aware of her role in my education. Sometimes, she would take me on the bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms filled with paintings. My mother didn’t mind this outing and even started to have opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and joking, ""Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first friends, all girls. Even though I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was clear in my memory, just like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. As I walked, I noticed that the houses changed; the porches became lower, and the front yards got smaller. 

Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how the people living there used those spaces and how they dealt with the smells of the products that used to be sold there.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick walls and large doors that used to let in curtains from the nearby train tracks. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space. He found it hard to relax or work when everything was visible. To create some separation, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic to divide the entrance area. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and led the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 

To balance the modern look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with modern chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture from his parents or things he bought at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making it hard to understand whether he was escaping or exploring. He was a talented and unique writer, known for his first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977. This book changed travel writing; it was exciting like a thriller, romantic like fiction, and insightful like great literature. However, even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction. He often changed details to make stories more interesting or to highlight deeper meanings, suggesting that travel could reveal hidden histories meant to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I quickly ran across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created little splashes that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the sound of birds and creating a mist over the pool, as if the water was rising to meet the sky. 

In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming back and forth in the same place. Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, which makes reality feel less real. This is why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of our world by getting off the usual paths and discovering things for ourselves. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent studies suggest he was likely wrong. Scientists, including psychiatrist John Bowlby, have shown that crying plays an important role in building the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. The sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. In early human communities, crying may have helped create trust and connections among people. 

There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for someone facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or inspiring speeches. We are also more likely to cry when watching a touching movie with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying is clear, but research on this topic is still ongoing."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect our lives? Most people know what global warming is, but few understand its consequences. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil.

Humans have learned to use natural resources to help us produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are serious. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased gas levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge makes it hard to predict the current and future situations.

We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These programs analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climate factors to predict past, present, and future climate conditions. However, GCMs are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only estimates, and they can be slow and expensive to run. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, even though we know it is complex.

Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than we have ever experienced. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the world we will live in over the next few generations. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15 to 95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 

These predictions show the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they have, and their ability to provide resources that societies depend on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many areas, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some changes may be beneficial. For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat production has increased due to climate trends, such as higher minimum temperatures leading to fewer frosts and less damage to crops.

However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed. In southern Portugal, rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter, with less in spring.

Another negative effect could be changes to glaciers, which would impact ice and vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong chance that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.

The most dramatic effect of global warming will likely be rising sea levels. This will happen because warmer water takes up more space and because of melting ice. Since about half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding is a major concern, with cities like London, New York, and Tokyo at risk of significant disruption. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, leading to millions of environmental refugees. The worst effects would be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if the worst predictions come true. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands, as well as for the countries that would need to take in those displaced."
CPE_66,"**Mission to Mars**

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. 

The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, which is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. 

It is a challenging task, but there is a race to create new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the work done will help improve future space missions."
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

The existence of art can sometimes make it harder to understand art theory. This is because art is a physical product that exists outside of us. People often think of a work of art as just a building, book, painting, or statue, separate from human experience. However, the true meaning of art comes from how it interacts with our experiences, which can make understanding it difficult.

Additionally, the perfection and long history of some artworks create standards that can block new ideas. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it seems to be removed from the human experiences that created it and the feelings it brings to life. When art is separated from its origins and its effects on our experiences, it becomes hard to see its true significance, which is what art theory tries to explain. Art then seems to exist in its own world, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of art is to reconnect the refined experiences of art with everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains relate to the earth, and similarly, art theorists must show how art relates to our lives.

To understand art better, we sometimes need to set it aside and focus on ordinary experiences that we don’t usually think of as artistic. We must take a different path to reach art theory. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about plants, but to truly understand how they grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.

To grasp the essence of art, we should start with raw experiences—those moments that catch our attention and bring us joy. However, many people have ideas that place art on a high pedestal, making them uncomfortable with the idea that they enjoy everyday activities because of their aesthetic qualities. 

Today, the arts that people enjoy the most are often not seen as traditional art forms. For example, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are popular. When people think of art as something only found in museums and galleries, they miss out on the joy found in everyday experiences. Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the idea that art is separate from ordinary life. 

The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

Many people think that lions hunting together is a beautiful sight. In the fading light of sunset, a group of lions quietly moves in to catch their prey. They seem to be perfect social animals, working together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after years of studying lions in the wild, we have a different view. 

When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then working together does not always help. If one animal is too generous, it may lose out while others benefit. So, why don’t lions follow the usual rules of self-interest? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. 

It has taken various research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to find answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented band that had struggled before. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of local styles emerged. 

The album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. It featured humor and honesty, with voices that proudly showed their roots. Bedrock proved to be skilled at collecting ideas and writing songs. They wrote about traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength was in its deeper, sadder songs like ""So Low,"" which had a beautiful melody related to weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. 

The best part of ""New Life"" is its high quality - all 16 tracks are excellent, making it a standout album in an era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. In the end, he bought the last three for the full price. I understood that there was an important lesson about sales and life in this story.

I was often a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something interesting so that the other children would want to join me. It worked, and it is a lesson I have never forgotten.

When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find a topic that mattered to me. I am not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to visit. I am mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you send your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. Usually, a junior member of the editorial team or an experienced freelancer will look at it. Neither has much power, but they want to find something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced one wants to keep their job.

If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor, who will discuss it in a meeting. The editor must explain why your novel is worth accepting and whether you seem like a promising author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is important for promoting a new book. Because of this, publishers often like to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. Over half a million people were unemployed, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in work. Many people and companies around the world suffered.

Advertising professionals were not unique in losing their jobs during this time, but those who kept their jobs often felt a lot of pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping their companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. At the same time, they were asked to do more with smaller budgets. They were told that spending less could lead to better results. However, the importance of marketing was also growing. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. 

In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies have started to take marketing seriously. This has helped improve the status of marketing professionals, but it has also increased their workload. Marketing is often seen as a solution to many problems, but about half of marketing budgets go to advertising. This means that advertising professionals are under a lot of pressure to show results. 

The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economy, but there were also deeper changes happening. The recession made companies rethink their advertising budgets and question the value of advertising. Many companies wanted to know what they were getting for their money and what return they were seeing on their investments. Advertising, which has always faced skepticism, was now under even more scrutiny.

Client companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working on their accounts and to be motivated to produce excellent work. While this situation may not inspire sympathy for advertising professionals, it does mean they face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

Several factors have made effective advertising even harder to create. Some of these are due to the recession, like debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes are happening regardless of the economy, such as demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws. Additionally, some companies are now trying to advertise internationally.

These challenges have led many advertising professionals to reconsider the saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" There is now more pressure than ever to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those who want to improve is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their successful strategies private. 

As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful information, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced by advertising agencies is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Most people did not see cooking as a good job. Being a chef is often seen as hard work: the hours are long, the pressure is high, the tasks can be simple, and the pay is low. However, these reasons did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like a great way to escape the stress of university life. It offered a sense of purpose and honesty that I felt was missing in my college experience.

My wish to cook was not just a reaction to my time as a student; it also came from a love for food. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was an amazing experience. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt so grateful to the chef that I wanted to kneel down and cry. I felt happy and light for days. This experience made me want to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life into a preparation for becoming a chef. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making elaborate meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The swimming instructor at my school was a tough ex-drill sergeant, small but strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed and bent slightly down at the front. It looked very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped into the air. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on small boats. They might eat insects if there is nothing else to eat and can live for months in uncertain conditions. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our everyday lives, and we often think of it as unimportant. We can simply return to our lives with microwaves and phones, relieved that our own risks are more predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not where he feels comfortable, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a world-class sailor, but he is skilled. The main reason he sails is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing gives him exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors focus on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, a sailor can often let an autopilot take over, which may be why Raban has time to carefully watch the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. There are fewer types of people than there are individuals, so in the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in having, using words we might struggle to find. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their writing, which is even more surprising if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.

Through reading and travel, we can escape the dullness of our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, just like when we read a great book that shows us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of details, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, the dishonesty of a friend, or a sadness we didn’t know we felt.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to restore parts that were cut by the editor, but I have added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. Looking back, I could have made more improvements, but that would have taken too long. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would no longer be a report of that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or anywhere else, I was there in that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already happened. This is the real story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special skills for exploring it except the price of a ticket. However, I don’t believe all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term appeared in the early 1980s, showing a rise in environmental awareness and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through Australian gorges. Any tour that involves cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make informed choices, the lack of rules and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn’t as helpful as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another and often staying for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I added many warnings. But then I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a new idea that developed because of capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their studies in the 16th and 17th centuries when trade and markets began to grow. As societies became more complex, populations grew, and new technologies for making different types of clothing were created, the meanings of what we wear also became more complicated. Because of this, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means today. For instance, a man's suit, which seems to be a sign of uniformity, can mean very different things in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports in newspapers about publishers fighting over popular new books can give a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to earn a living. The smartest writers work full-time jobs and write in the evenings, so they have a backup plan if their book is not quickly published or made into a movie. Others, like me, take on various small jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small places we were performing in across the country started to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our supporters at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of all our needs. Although I still felt shy, it was mixed with a strange, naive confidence that only people who are usually shy and suddenly become famous can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to fewer live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for professional musicians.

It is clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. On a national level, no important state event happens without music. For individuals, music offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play musical instruments.

I believe that people will continue to want to learn instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is a part of measuring intelligence. While these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus better, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also looking into how playing an instrument might help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice can help create good study habits and focus, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I believe two things are likely to happen. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music. This will make it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills, but it may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If this vision for the future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and how progress is measured to stay relevant for a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be essential. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a big change from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 

Positively, this change will allow those involved in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the importance of music itself. Music is vital in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession needs to work together to ensure this changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes, actors face criticism and disrespect. Much of this negative opinion comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often use boring clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when it is performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and unimportant. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the writer's ideas. After a play ends, they feel empty until they perform again, and this emptiness shows in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet shows a young man caught between being a boy and a man. His acting is simple yet confident. He skillfully handles the text and shows great control over his body and emotions. Lester portrays Hamlet as a young man filled with anger but also humor, making him both strong and likable. His physical presence, like the way his arms hang, suggests he is waiting to be brought to life. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that also feels like he is moved by an inner force.

**What is Acting?**

Acting raises questions about behavior. Is acting just copying real behavior, or does it create something new? What gives life to the characters on stage? These are important questions in the world of theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process starts with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find the right moment to speak. For example, if the line is about remembering a rainy night spent queuing, the actor should breathe and let the memory come to them. They might picture a queue at a bus stop or a concert. The director encourages actors to be open-minded and trust that something will happen during the rehearsal.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make the audience feel that their presence matters. Attending a live performance should feel special, and the staff should share this feeling. It can be uncomfortable if the staff seem uninterested. The theatre should create a connection between the performers and the audience. The audience should be close enough to hear and see everything clearly. The design of the auditorium is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the space is too big, it can feel wrong because drama is about human experiences. Many theatres built in the late 1800s got this right by creating spaces that feel welcoming. 

When attending a play, the audience wants to see something surprising and unique. If it is predictable, they might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly popular among young people, but it also had a big effect on the middle class and older adults. This music opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it with excitement, knowing that this unique sound would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential for many young rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool listening to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to make the next big move for a teenager who loved rock and roll: creating his own music.

**Snow**

I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to climb out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that try to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of mystery about how researchers analyze their findings. To help with this, we invited different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to talk about their methods. The goal was to share insights about the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in various styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 

Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. 

Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach our children is fine, but traditional education is still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people did not like this change, seeing the newcomers as rude. However, they eventually accepted that success was important. In Hollywood, success is measured by how much money a film makes. 

Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. 

Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films. People talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the main place for anyone in show business.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the 19th century as a new way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography allowed them to do this. The combination of light, lenses, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took much longer to create. 

This new art form surprised other artists. At first, they were happy about it, but then they claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on machines. They believed that true art came from human creativity. 

Despite the criticism, photographers knew they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists used brushes and pencils to show their view of the world, nature, and people.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, every children's book needed illustrations. This was also true for many novels for older readers, although fewer were published over time. Children's publishing was mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality works, but the best artists always gave their best effort. 

The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable works, making it a great place for research and discovery. The best illustrations will likely be shown to the public again, either through new editions of classic books or exhibitions of original artwork. There are signs that interest in this period of illustration is growing, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations, either by reprinting them or creating new editions using the original art."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with Caution**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts that tell people where you are. The message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that while sharing online can be exciting, it can also have negative effects.

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to fame and wealth. However, we often dive into this world without thinking about the risks, sharing personal stories and photos without realizing how crowded and dangerous it can be.

But there is hope. The early internet users, known as bloggers, have already faced these challenges. They explored the internet before social media existed, experiencing both the good and bad sides of sharing online. Their experiences can teach us valuable lessons.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by researchers and students at that time. He saw a chance to share his life and created a personal blog filled with stories and pictures. In 1996, he began posting daily, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything, and while some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the art in his work.

However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to remove the blog, feeling that sharing so much made people distrust him. This shows that while sharing online can be fun, it can also lead to disappointment.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, who worked in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job, but one day, a colleague shared her blog with the company's executives, including those she had criticized. As a result, she lost her job. This situation highlights the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, we should think carefully before we share."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common problem in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. 

One important idea is that ""People need more sleep,"" according to a leading sleep researcher. Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic. Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he allowed participants to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing they needed more rest.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, such as how tiredness affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour to change their sleep patterns as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator where participants are asked to drive while answering questions. They always come in at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after a poor night’s sleep. As they drive, one participant tries hard not to fall asleep. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he falls asleep for a few seconds, causing the car to drift off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay awake and drive safely for at least half an hour. She also recommends energy products like tablets and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What do we know for sure about human sleep? Like other mammals, humans sleep in a daily cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Scientists believe that sleep helps repair body tissues and muscles, but it is unclear if this happens faster during sleep or while we are awake and relaxed. 

Research shows that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, although the reasons are not fully understood. Some researchers even say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt.""

Sleep patterns have changed over time. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. 

By the 17th century, with more artificial light, wealthy people began to adopt the sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later forced most people to work longer hours in lighted buildings. However, in many non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They might sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noises from animals and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about really big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots, which cost 800 dollars each, on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I was not one. I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains and realized I did not belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy arriving from the sky. But that thought disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a worn-out bag. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and walked out without saying anything.

I thought there should be some clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But now, I couldn’t do it anymore. I wondered what I should do next. A racing driver should have other options for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but they just vanished when I tried to reach for them.

One idea was to be a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me for that job. Another idea was to sell classic cars, but that didn’t work out either. I spent a lot of time on phone calls, lunches, and meetings, but nobody was buying old cars that year. So, I decided to step back before I lost everything.

Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, people would only listen for a short time before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I really miss the excitement of driving a powerful racing car. I miss the thrill of going from zero to 150 miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing.

I miss the bright, interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous had its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to tell their friends they knew me. Young boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. But now that I don’t race anymore, things are different. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have a lot of free time now. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I saw some small brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped the city improve. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I don’t think that’s the main reason. It is more likely that, in our work, we try hard to make our writing very effective, so we lose the natural feeling of writing a letter. A true artist, who does not focus on making their writing perfect (even if they rewrite many times), does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is what makes someone a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the use of long words made them powerful and showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. You could always expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, so having a celebrity is no longer necessary. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, older people waiting in line didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived late."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement. However, it was not a big success at the box office. The film was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the person it was based on, might do to them. It was only later, when it was shown on television, that people started to appreciate it. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of experience; he didn’t know what he could or couldn’t do, so he just went for it. He also had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took this opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel nodded but seemed distant, as if she didn’t really understand. Dermot asked her, “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back and said, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator), but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how a single photo could capture the spirit of a place, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. My rule was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep looking for new shots. 

I had a moment of success when a photo I took of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was just luck, but they say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photos, and I was getting paid for it, which I thought was good.

The assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice payment for capturing the beauty of my city in different seasons. I knew that some of my best work would be ignored because it was just a picture book, not something meant to challenge people’s views.

After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t need to know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things were not going well for me at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great.

They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it had been a busy and hot trip, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs, I felt excited. I was ready to take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to enjoy the atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, just like the grand buildings from the old empire that shaped the city. I didn’t want to see what Schussner had done in other seasons; I wanted to create my own version of Vienna.

A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time, observing everything until I was ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz look beautiful and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was huge and heavy in the center of the city. I realized I might have to take a partial shot instead. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the science behind it. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been an important but often overlooked theme in creative work during this time. 

The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, organized by curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for many years. The artworks are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering and connecting ideas on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it shows themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's lively personality and humor, which makes him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks serious purpose? 

Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. But others argue that his popularity does not mean his work is unimportant. Hockney himself understands his limitations and believes it is not fair to judge his art based on traditional ideas of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and knows that only future generations can truly judge his work.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others not so good. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a specific idea, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, and we notice new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, though, it feels forced or questionable. 

As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. Together with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse for an exhibition called ""Window-shopping."" This show featured individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera until it broke, creating a flickering image on a monitor. These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other in their differences. 

I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is an individual activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their experience. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. 

Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we are experiencing. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our enjoyment is not simple. How we feel and recognize beauty is influenced by our society and its values. 

While we should appreciate our instinctive responses to art, the belief that thinking about art takes away from our enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as something separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow pebble on the riverbed. This pebble did not feel like stone, but it was beautiful. This could be how gold first entered the lives of early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they began to search for copper ores and ways to extract copper from them. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, struggling with our heavy bags against strong winds and trying to avoid icy waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the cottages by the water were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With dark clouds gathering, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced wars and droughts are long gone. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are now forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or the population and observe how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this trick every time the stranger tried to approach. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while walking across the open ground himself.  

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the village of Felmersham, people collected information about what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America estimated that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide places for birds to nest, keeping their population above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.  

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who often sleep near their owners, slowly leave their resting place to go to the reed beds. They take their time, groaning about the hard day ahead. Eventually, the leader steps into the water, and the others follow. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but soon they are swimming, barely keeping their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on the green shoots they can reach.  

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping shapes and soft colors that create a calm underwater feeling. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes and the chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life. In this short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small things. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of space, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The first known images date back to about 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans created cave paintings. They might have recorded real hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply made daily life more colorful. These early images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera worked like the human eye, capturing images that looked very similar to what we see in real life. This ability to fix images chemically allowed photography to capture natural moments.

At the same time, photography was seen as a sophisticated art form, producing images that artists had worked hard to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photo of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we must consider how much photography can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural rules like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey reality? Photography is often seen as a convincing form of evidence, making it easy to confuse our view of the world with its photographic representations. For instance, it is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people view it have changed a lot. This change may be partly because photography has moved into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once close to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often tell us more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.

I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not only reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our homes."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. It is important to be creative, but one wrong move can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best way to learn is through reading a lot, writing often, and letting your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t become chaotic. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can express their feelings through writing during tough times. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration to strike. All approaches are valid, as long as they are not just following strict rules. The key is to find your own voice and nurture it, allowing it to grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it is important not to have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to explain something important. A memory from the main character can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different perspectives quickly, keeping the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn’t mean you should just summarize the story. The conflict and action in a short story should be as strong as in a novel, but every word must be meaningful in a shorter format.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. Most players make mistakes along the way. We may not know everything, but we understand enough to play. We can sometimes see a few moves ahead, and that feels good. As we learn more about chess, we realize that it is more about long-term strategy than just short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, not just individual moves. In both chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand the complexities involved.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally want to communicate, as seen in how children talk. However, no child is born knowing how to write. Charles Darwin pointed out that while speaking is instinctive, writing is not. Language exists in all cultures, past and present. Although languages change, they do not necessarily become better. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they are together without a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and started as simple codes that improved over time. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. A group of children is unlikely to create an alphabet on their own. Children are naturally good at listening and speaking, but learning to read and write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write down what I know.

To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that the way he lives and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book.

I believe my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same liberty that historians do by putting words into the mouths of my characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would not be as effective if told in a simple way. I want my book to be enjoyable to read, and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make it so. A smart reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.

Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe you can only really know those from your own country. People are shaped by many things: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. All these experiences make them who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live through those experiences yourself. Because you can only know people from a different country through observation, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen through my own perspective, just like my main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those living in it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important writers. Right now, there is a complex mix of different styles of poetry, groups of poets, and ways to present, criticize, and teach poetry. There are also different opinions about what a poet's role in society should be.

In general, the current discussion in poetry is about the distrust between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work in front of an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in village halls or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students, and arts festivals often include poetry readings by well-known poets.

These events have many effects, and it is unclear how they benefit poets. For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed live, public readings are very helpful. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique become clear.

On the other hand, poets who are serious about their craft aim to create deep and meaningful work. They try to express strong emotions and ideas in a small space and use varied rhythms. Unfortunately, these poets may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that they might only read their simplest poems to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best work.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this approach has its challenges. It is unrealistic to think that a person's story is a perfect reflection of their past. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final result is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may affect how the informant shares their memories. Historians must recognize their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories may be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings of nostalgia or resentment about their past. These emotions can make the testimony seem more convincing, but they may not accurately represent the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence that behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs studying a few species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these two areas are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. For example, trying to explain how a bird builds a nest by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge: they must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on different parts of social life, uses specific methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius defined architecture as involving order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provided Greek terms for some of these concepts, likely based on earlier Greek writings that we no longer have. While utility and function are not part of his definition, Vitruvius does discuss the best designs for different types of buildings later in his work. Initially, he emphasizes the artistic side of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early buildings were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural ideas. Despite how elaborate classical temples may seem, they essentially started as simple, single-room huts."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled of sulphur. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week. They planned to leave early in the morning and return by midday so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her worries, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted that Mui didn’t trust her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily even passed a couple of slow cars with great skill, which made Mui keep quiet. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street near the sea that had many empty spaces. She wasn’t sure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. 

Lily noticed her sister’s worried face in the driving mirror. She thought it was better not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don’t worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily told Chen he was ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too proud. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee, their son, to look at the grey sea. He held Man Kee close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers, which he struggled with, and to grow up to own many restaurants.

As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and happiness while thinking about Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship shining in the sunlight. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he finally spotted it. It was a small, old tramp steamer. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special ship for people like us. It may look small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily and Mui joined them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I once read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket away from the wall. As soon as it was free, I fell into the well. I hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I felt dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say.

You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle’s main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. My mother and father appeared with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming, and my father was shouting for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a mix of excitement and fear.

Then I noticed the drops of dirty well water I had left behind, forming a small pool at my feet. I looked back into the courtyard, where my father was shining a flashlight down into the well. I couldn’t believe no one had seen the drops. My mother was now screaming in a way I had never heard before, and it shook me. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank was turning into something that could lead to serious trouble for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 

Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I took a deep breath and said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat. I claimed I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father appeared in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed, and I realized I was only making things worse. I said the secret passage had collapsed after me and that the well was dangerous. I looked into my father’s eyes and felt like I was looking into a dark tunnel with no way out. 

He said, “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” with more disappointment than I had ever felt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, looking troubled. He didn’t feel sorry for me because I had a scary adventure, but because he could see through my lie. He worried about what kind of person I would become if I kept lying. His pity hurt me more than my father’s words. It made me realize that both my actions and my father’s reaction were serious, and I couldn’t ignore them."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The moving van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, with his big fingers, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that looked over a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there felt present in the air, like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, being bossy and insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan was not crying and said, ""That's something."" Curious, Susan asked, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You'd be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They are fine once they get to the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""

Susan could understand that feeling. If she had been alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' job to notice any problems. The piano was now the last item to be moved, sitting proudly in the best room of the house.

Sitting on the bottom stair, since all the chairs were gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours to get it up. Little Robert watched in excitement while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't!"" They had to find a way to get it inside because Francesca was meant to be a concert pianist.

Eventually, Peter, her late husband, solved the problem. They left the piano in the garden while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. Then, a crane was borrowed from a local farmer to lift the piano through the window. The children were overjoyed to see it come in, but it cost a lot of money, and they had to wait months to have it tuned.

""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children became too busy to visit on weekends, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and how the banister rails were still not fixed perfectly. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but now it was too late. 

Suddenly, Fred asked, ""Are you all right?"" He reminded her that the piano was the last thing to move. Susan felt nervous as she moved away from the stairs. Robert and Francesca appeared to watch. Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Susan was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. 

Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing together, relieved that it was over. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that became available to everyone: literary criticism. 

By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions and rate books with up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This helped Amazon fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, instead of just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.

Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted every day, making it hard to check them all. A team of editors looked for reviews that followed Amazon's rules, such as no one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to misbehave.

For example, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive ones anonymously to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews.

Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a special link. Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments were really from the authors, except for well-known writers. 

When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press. But many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as good for business. 

Amazon monitored reviews closely, especially for bestsellers, to ensure they followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping* inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, but such silliness was rare.

Most reviewers on Amazon took their writing seriously, and their reviews often provided a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This shows that making literary criticism available to everyone is a positive change."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say that some artists have gone too far, claiming that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these opinions for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to always be new and different. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes and methods that are still present in today’s art.

We expect artists to be different from ordinary people, with special talents that make them stand out. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work on their own and sometimes get frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I want to describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book that talks about the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then simply states, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This may sound childish, but stay with me. 

After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and then to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the text on the canvas in a simple way, without any fancy designs. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in plain black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: is this finished piece a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find success in one style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep producing similar work, and if they try something new, it can upset the audience. Gallery owners prefer to play it safe, and perhaps art buyers feel more comfortable with familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully broken this rule. 

Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying to change his style. He is moving away from the still lifes that made him famous to focus on the London Underground. Rimmington finds the railway fascinating. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore what happens underground. His new exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique charm of this hidden world designed for people on the move.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old woman who comes from the village each day to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories.

I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The true comfort of my work as an artist lies in the fact that, in the quiet moments of painting or writing, I can rearrange reality and show its deeper meaning. Our everyday actions often hide the true beauty of life. For artists, creating art allows us to deal with the pain and challenges of daily life, not to escape from them, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice with him, had just picked me and my trunk from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford."" 

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you are good at talking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 

""Be that as it may,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart is not in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I could see many career options, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the talent - the brains, the courage, the vision."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice hated the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I had taken care of him since we were kids. It was not hard because I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and went to parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businessmen - and our home was always lively with good conversations. 

""I tell you what,"" my father said, continuing our talk. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" 

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 

So it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 

In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 

But then my father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last important task for him, the biggest project the family business had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my time. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell my father didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever how focused and determined he was, how he approached his work with energy and control. In his way, he was a kind of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important. 

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning a house that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had been successful at work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency two months after having twins and received a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. She strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a good address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Lois felt that even saying the name of their old flat lowered her status.

Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport. Since her office was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to travel by tube. The crowded journey made him feel resentful and unhappy. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. He remembered the smell of dinner and how his grandmother cared for his grandfather after a long day at work. She was a supportive lawyer's wife, always present at legal events and seemingly happy with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were essential for their lifestyle. Their home, the au pair, and everything depended on both of their incomes. Now, their hard work could be ruined by Venetia, who seemed to be in a bad mood.

Venetia must have come straight from court, and she was furious. Someone had pushed her to her limit. Simon blamed himself for not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened. He remembered every word of her angry accusations. She said, ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he bribed three jurors. You did nothing. Is that true?"" Simon replied, ""He's lying. It isn't true."" She continued, ""He also said he gave shares in his company to your fiancée before the trial. Is that true?"" Again, Simon insisted, ""He's lying. None of it is true."" His denial felt instinctive but unconvincing, and he felt guilty. The shock on his face turned to shame, reminding him of the fear he felt in his headmaster's office. He looked into Venetia's eyes and saw her disbelief.

If only he had been prepared. He now knew what he should have said: ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. He will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who made Venetia the judge of their legal practice? Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was unsure of what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t care about the worn-out rented houses, messy gardens, or old furniture. However, I was wrong. People in the shops, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some herbs to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive.

“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She is a writer with several unpublished stories, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness sake! In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies, then continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. She knocks on my door. “So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you.” She sits in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should’ve gone into teaching. Writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither.

“So, what are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel overwhelmed by the empty days ahead. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum, walks to the shops, and sitting alone in the park. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” My heart races as I ask. “Of course I will,” Jaz says, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction.

“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my work so far?” Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning her manuscripts. I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, surprised. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good. A little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz replies, acting like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say. My advice sounds a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but then I suddenly remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She used to wink at us and say, “I’ve had my moments.” We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, we also have a need to learn about our broader history to understand our future, both as individuals and as a nation. Heritage helps us feel a sense of continuity; knowing about the past can give us confidence about the future. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being. It influences our customs and material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these oral traditions have been lost. Now, we often look to places and buildings to understand our past. It is very important to preserve these connections as a way to honor our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England called the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people asked me why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about this area. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed flat and empty, which provided a good setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not really flat or empty. They are uniquely English but also strangely different. It is surprising that there is a place in the middle of England that many people find unfamiliar, especially since many other areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, seemingly simple yet deeply mysterious. While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively, as I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict facts. However, trying to imagine the Fens is important because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant just putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility should mean more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and create emotional connections. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and they have started offering similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects, not replicas. They exist to provide a genuine experience with history. They show items that were used and had meaning at some point in time. This is their strength and what makes them different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that meet this challenge and create exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by increasing interest in real historical experiences.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and on a large scale, affecting many people. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of our towns today and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more likely to value preservation than earlier generations because stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not a problem if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity', which are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experiences. 

Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thinking, a revolution that started modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer description of the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won awards because we thought they would be boring. Our mother often criticized us for this attitude, but our father would give us small coins as rewards for reading better books. He would also include some interesting books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we thought most of his choices were 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some good short stories and, once, to a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous.' This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad. Early humans, who lived in dangerous places with wild animals, made desperate noises, and some of these sounds are still present in words today, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" and the Latin word 'mors' meaning ""death"". 

Many people avoided discussing the origin of language because they thought it was a topic for odd theories. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. There are strict deadlines and limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only read for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Often, both the public and the writers believe that people only write reviews because they need money. Another reason might be that writers cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book, so they do reviews instead.

However, writing reviews is a skilled job that requires different abilities. Writing a short review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a longer review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine, which is about fifteen hundred words, has challenges from both short and long formats. 

Reviewers must also think about their audience. Some readers may only skim the review, while others may be very interested and want a detailed analysis. Additionally, a reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.

The American novelist John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews when he is not working on his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in those reviews.

I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been in academia, and most of my serious books are academic, which professors are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study. It is common for the same people to do both. The time has passed when other academics criticized professors for writing reviews, thinking it was a waste of time or not dignified. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking away their opportunities are also less common now, partly because there are many more reviews available, so almost anyone can write one.

I believe this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about, and professors benefit because writing reviews helps them stay connected to the public. It also reminds them that they need to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may use complex language when talking to each other, they should make sure to be understandable when addressing a wider audience.

In conclusion, despite its importance, reviewing is usually a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes hit him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. 

He thought he should worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, looking either independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. 

There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were intact and nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened. From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. 

Once he left the busy office and started his bus ride home, he no longer wanted to be alone, even though he often thought he did. Sitting at his desk, he craved solitude and time to himself, but when he finally escaped, he felt empty. He suspected that the work he did, which didn’t suit him, was changing him and pulling him away from who he really was. 

As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he began to wonder for whom he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and his thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself but found that he only wanted to get by. 

He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they rushed toward their goals, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He went to one job interview, feeling grateful, but didn’t think to question the job itself, which was a vague editorial position at a local newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he was surprised when Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied. Ralph took this as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It was not as fancy as regular racecourses, but it was similar because people lined up on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. It was a challenge to keep a few selected goats in line, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our flashlight batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. We realized we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. We kept moving forward.

**How to be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and my confidence? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many leaders are expected to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help you think of difficult questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will just get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some things can be done faster, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math in your head. But other things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need results"" can be unhelpful, just like trying to get a good night's sleep in a short time. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are sayings that reflect this: ""He who hesitates is lost,"" and ""Look before you leap."" Both are true.

Generally, the mind has three different speeds of processing information. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to help me stay safe. It was only after that I realized what had happened. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also does not have time to think about their next move. This quick reaction can be called our ""wits.""

The second speed is thought itself. This involves reasoning, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this type of intelligence, which we often call ""intellect."" People who are good at solving these problems are seen as ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and can be playful or dreamy. In this mode, we think things over or reflect. For example, sitting on a rock by the sea, listening to the waves, or being half-asleep puts us in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ones. Allowing our minds to wander is not a luxury; it is necessary, especially when life gets busy. We need both the quick mind and the slow mind.

Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some complex issues can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that slower, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complicated situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday is usually straightforward. But when we are unsure about what to consider or which questions to ask, we need to use our slow mind. 

If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it may be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less direct ways of thinking. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than quick thinking."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. We form a close community where everyone helps each other. My school French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details of the language, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a big problem for me, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, and I felt anxious when I spoke. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes from losing the social confidence I used to have when I could speak easily.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely but did not want to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, he sent me a note asking me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting. Instead, he focused on the photography and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people react to the film itself, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made well, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius craftsman who loved to hear the audience scream. He did not deal with guesses or complex ideas, and he did not explore his characters deeply. He focused on film itself and the precise beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment that you can buy. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we create almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities 50 years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with trails from airplanes that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do, options to choose from, and opportunities available. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology makes everything change faster. New products come out quickly, and before you know it, another one is already on the way. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in our economy, having too many choices can cause stress, take up time, and make life more complicated. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" – the simple things that bring meaning to our complex lives. However, simplifying life is not easy in a world with so many options. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we really need, and more software updates and plans than we can keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. We are a special group of guests at McAndrews: old-fashioned and perhaps a bit snobbish. I dislike the bad manners of shop assistants today, which some people think is fair treatment. I also don’t like the overly friendly behavior of waiters who seem to want to treat guests like friends. I know the names of many other guests because, like me, they have been coming here since childhood. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings and nothing more. This respect for privacy and dignity is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is a mistake, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include the one where Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to feel emotional during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the deep interior, life does not exist—except for a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the coming years.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the search for knowledge is important, and we want to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to focus on whether what scientists do is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very important and satisfying. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and put them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or a tin of soup. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can make a tasty dessert in just five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your food with others. Sharing meals is important to our human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would want to discuss business over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he would organize them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and journals were close to new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and neatness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and seemed to think, ""No way am I going in there."" She went into his apartment, which was her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson thought he was someone from another world, not from her familiar streets of Brooklyn.

**KAREN**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story and identity. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The golf club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small blessings, she realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to know something important in a small community, where her life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sadness for Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly throat problems. Miss Fogerty believed his best quality was making patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, which earned him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be impressed by her performances. Watching her play the piano with great skill is exciting. However, at a recent concert for kids, one small boy surprised her. After watching her play many different styles of music, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This request made Joanna laugh. She realized that, to him, she was not a real pianist until she played that song. Of course, she played it and enjoyed the moment.

Joanna is different from many famous pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published a beginner's piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She managed to write this book despite her busy schedule, which includes many music festivals and collaborations with other artists. 

Many people are surprised that she took on the extra work of writing a book. Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. She thinks that most people are not interested in becoming great musicians but just want to enjoy music. This idea is what drives her to help children learn.

Joanna has a lot of experience teaching beginners. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many children how to play the piano. She also grew up in a home where her mother taught piano, and many kids came to learn. This experience taught her that music should be available to everyone, not just those with special talent.

She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speaking a little French. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to perform like the talented children they see on TV.

Joanna worries that some parents use music to push their children to achieve, instead of letting them enjoy it. She thinks this pressure can make kids stop playing because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.

When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good enough, Joanna is careful with her words. She does not want to criticize others. Instead, she believes her colorful and engaging books are just one option among many that can help children enjoy learning.

To make her books interesting, she includes stories and music on CDs. This way, children can have fun while learning. For kids whose parents do not play the piano, the music is recorded on the CDs. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. She encourages children to improvise and explore the piano.

As children progress, they need to learn to read music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. 

She knows it can be hard to get children to practice, but she suggests that they should have clear goals. Joanna also shares tips for practice: play through the whole piece, even with mistakes, and mix difficult pieces with easier ones. 

In the end, Joanna wants to help children enjoy music and learn to play the piano in a fun and engaging way."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find that the time they spend fixing mistakes on a computer is about the same as the time they would have spent writing by hand. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, many people now write love letters through email, which is a positive change. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often do not realize the power of writing and may exaggerate their messages. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and carefully handed him the disc. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be played to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people believe that electronic text is a change as important as the invention of printing, but they forget that real changes in how we think take a long time. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often a frustrating experience, so most people do not do it. Computers encourage people to read only parts of texts. Some people claim that this leads to new ways of storytelling, but many books have always been read in a non-linear way. What is new is that computers do not encourage reading a text from start to finish.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered it from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being put away. Twelve years of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work.""

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He could not imagine a computer or any other machine in this space, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had discussed this many times over the two years they had known each other. She could never understand why he resisted technology, even though he was skilled with computers and had published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard, she could create new software that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot things because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being overwhelmed with work and struggling to find a parking spot in the mornings.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by commissioning books from him. Ian was known for being unpredictable, and Lancelot felt that he was becoming even more difficult to work with.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, Ian's manuscript would not be ready anytime soon. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that Ian was known for, and it felt like it had lost its original purpose. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, but in that case, the payments were small amounts that had never been given. Ian had received a huge advance, which went against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.

Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed less motivated than them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. For some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew even more. At the height of his influence, he was already known to be difficult to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but it only created stories about how much he was paid, which kept increasing in hopes of getting him to produce more work.

At editorial meetings, Ian would criticize others' ideas sharply. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for important events. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new idea in England. You rarely find descriptions of breakfast in medieval literature. There are some mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone, not just the rich. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal first thing in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For example, a casual reader of a newspaper usually understands the photographs printed in it. However, instead of just accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly shows what the scene looked like at that moment. Does it express the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal and put everything else aside. Sports can be tough, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve personal success, but you should always remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot to enjoy these benefits.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory so clearly that they become special moments we remember well. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a beautiful musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying a stunning live performance. I reacted with joy as I listened to its incredible variations until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether they love, fear, or admire them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports.

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Some see the wren as a sign of something important, while others think it is just a bird that is lost. Both ideas could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction a wren flew could tell them about their luck. Today, wrens are still seen in art and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about them have faded, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels empty and sad.

This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way of understanding the importance of different animals. However, these beliefs can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once admired in London for taking bread from children. But soon, people saw them as pests and they disappeared from many areas, except Wales. Now, red kites are valued again and are being protected and reintroduced to help them thrive.

Our connection with birds goes back to the early days of humanity. The first birdwatchers paid close attention to birds because they could warn of danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected people to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, and our interest in them reflects our own identity in nature.

Some people think our feelings for birds are outdated and no longer useful. But just like certain body parts, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be difficult. This is why birds are now seen as signs of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we might lose these birds but also because it represents a loss of culture. Birds carry deep meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize different kinds of love and magic. Many people feel sad about losing these birds, especially those mentioned in famous poems and stories.

However, the loss of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. Folklore is important because it includes stories and legends that connect us to the past. These stories create a stronger bond with birds than scientific facts do. They evoke feelings that are often hidden in our busy lives. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to describe, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their significance.

The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a rich history, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps us curious."""
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring was more about how easy it was to travel through the land than about the actual distance. 

Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often just as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not always show true directions. 

In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or simple symbols, and their size showed how important they were. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and location, so it is important to understand the specific style used in early maps.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and the amount of information included on maps. To achieve this, cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences. For example, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, they began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.

As explorers learned more about the world, they tried to create maps of what they knew. Astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to better mapping techniques. 

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land for military purposes. This led to the creation of contour maps. Later, archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had their own specific needs for maps.

Today, cartographers create maps that show various types of information, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has led to a new era in cartography.

It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change, with old ideas sometimes existing alongside new ones. Cartographers have often had to wait for better tools before they could use their new ideas. Since it is easier to copy old maps, and because map publishers can be resistant to change, we should not blindly trust maps as the latest knowledge.

The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide a valuable record of human history, which makes studying historical cartography both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on nice wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting school. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the famous composer Richard Rodgers. 

I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. If I had failed, it might have felt like a big deal, but I didn’t think it would be life or death. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. 

As he played songs from the many shows he had created at school, I remembered some of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist, and I didn’t have much to show him except for my praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written with an unknown pop group. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but I thought I had met someone special who would succeed in musical theatre very soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. 

The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I felt about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs, but it was likely I would finish my exams and become a lawyer by twenty-five. My father believed I would grow out of pop music by twenty-one, which worried me because that meant I only had a few months left to enjoy it. But I thought it would be fun to see Andrew again, to go to a musical with him, and to write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. 

I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I often doubted things. His talent was clear, and he claimed to have many important contacts. Soon, I was back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t excite me much. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's famous show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music was contagious and somewhat justified. 

What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for many years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place, there is room for another. We could be the second hamburger place. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which were likely thought up by his school friend who had tried writing before. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of lyrics for the musical. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that day marked a change in my career."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species that has a special ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so important in human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a genius spider and does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly caused by the air around us, greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. Climate can strongly influence the appearance of landscapes. For example, warm and wet conditions all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things. The daily weather patterns that create the climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement happens because the air rests on a spinning Earth. Since air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, the sun is a more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days training to make coffee, learning a lot about how to clean and maintain the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making a perfect, rich cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was not as easy as it seemed, and I thought I might have to go back to simple tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for the camera because it can show the entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are very few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of these arts. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he has almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art style that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to go at your own pace. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is known as ""The Sailing Capital of the World"" for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. However, many cyclists find these bikes too expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for regular cyclists. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell bike frames.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community than a traditional business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a reasonable price. 

As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create solid joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with thicker bamboo, then move on to the thinner parts for the seat and chain. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process requires careful cutting and technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help and check our work.

Many participants are engineers, and the chance to build the bike themselves is a big draw. Ian reassures us that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s okay to try again. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, allowing us to focus on the bike's design, choosing from plain bamboo, black, or mottled finishes.

On Sunday, we spend time building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique. James and Ian believe that the individuality of each bike is important. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. 

When I test James's bike, I find it light, stiff, and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James says that while some people enjoy building the bike, the real joy comes from riding it. Bamboo bikes are light and fun to ride, and they cost less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-Help Books**

Diane Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I looked at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very wealthy, and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's small book about improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry. This industry tries to meet many people's desires for self-improvement, but it also creates new desires and supports the publishing industry in New York. 

In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many books that are not very good, but there are even worse ones. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected because they are too similar to others or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often not a priority. What matters most is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions. She admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

When someone writes an autobiography, there should be an understanding between the writer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this understanding is often not fully respected. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They might feel ashamed of certain actions or thoughts, or they might think some things are not important enough to share. 

Sometimes, writers may feel that they can express the truth better by inventing stories rather than sticking strictly to the facts. They might call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe they are reading true events, even if the story is mostly fiction. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Students of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A detective story often symbolizes deeper human feelings like lust or greed, and solving the crime represents restoring order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt and false. 

In his tales, the detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. The detective understands the criminal, and they share a strange connection. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. He is both a criminal and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels guilty about his role, and this can make him more determined to punish the wrongdoers.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best science writers today. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable in such a fancy place. Gould said he couldn’t write well in such an environment. He believes that understanding the culture is essential for a successful writer. Science is its own world, and only those who are part of it can explain it well. 

One of Gould's main ideas is to never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language but must never change the main idea. If readers feel that you are talking down to them, they will lose interest."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To handle the unusually high temperatures this summer, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic. This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It has become a common part of our lives, showing how we can control the climate, or at least change it. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can make a big difference and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming more interested in sundials, which are tools that tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were very important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just decorations in gardens. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago. There, serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with careful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this experience, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure did not mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they did not question the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, when they learned they would be staying in the hotel for their entire holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""And we can take a boat to Interlaken."" 

Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds..."" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake,"" Keith repeated. The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 

Dawne then said, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen at Gatwick. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" 

Again, Dawne mentioned the travel agency and described the bald clerk. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 

Keith was impatient and wanted to speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" 

""I counted you, although you probably didn't see me,"" Mrs. Franks said. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 

""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But that couldn't happen."" 

""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems kind,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked very old. She said they had the best night's sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 

""That's nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that it was ironic they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people when the whole point of their holiday was to escape from the needs of older people. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the Endurance are being published, and the American Museum of Natural History is preparing a big exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and find lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become an example for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workers have to be let go."" While it may seem hard to connect Shackleton's survival skills in extreme cold to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership qualities. Shackleton had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, including their lives.

One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" 

From the diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. He thought things through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans if something was not working. MacGregor says they have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's story that clients can relate to without feeling criticized.

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical strength, and patience. MacGregor notes that one of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to be patient, especially in America, where people often want quick solutions. For example, if you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it is better to wait it out rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, if a new product is not selling well, it is important to change plans instead of continuing to sell it.

Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another time, during a 1905 expedition when they were near starvation, Shackleton offered to leave a biscuit in the snow instead of eating it himself, saying it was worth more than money.

As Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare today. He stands out as a genuine example of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye. Its way of finding food is similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker dig into wood to find insect larvae. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although scientists first described the aye-aye's unusual feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the logs with food, chewing through the wood without needing to see the holes. This suggested they might be using their sense of smell or hearing to find the mealworms. However, further tests showed they did not rely on these senses either. They could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent.

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they could sense the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and moves its large ears forward to listen closely. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye is using a method called echo-location, where it listens for sounds that bounce back from the hollow spaces in the wood. It can also hear the movement of insects when they are disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously, just like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? The few diaries we find give us only small pieces of information, and family stories are often only partly remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but these are still just images.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. Her work focuses on ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of their past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who really wanted to share their interesting lives. They often say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they enjoy the process too.""

The promise of privacy helps her clients feel comfortable sharing their stories. One 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure in business, said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful memories, like my divorce."" He wanted to share his story with his family so they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let his adult children read it yet. He feels there are details that might hurt them, and he prefers they read it after he is gone.

Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their childhood experiences. ""It’s amazing how much people are shaped by their parents,"" she says. ""The messages they received as children can affect them for their whole lives. They often repeat the same patterns in their relationships, either marrying people their parents liked or choosing partners as a way to rebel.""

Many people express regrets about their past. Even after many years, they still feel unresolved issues with their parents. If someone had problems in their youth, they often carry those into adulthood. Some people live their lives trying to impress a parent who never showed approval, and when that doesn’t work, they may feel the need to say, ""I can’t stand my mother.""

Hannah listens more than she asks questions. ""I’m not here to judge or pry,"" she explains. Sometimes, people share something and then worry if it should be included. She usually includes it, allowing them to remove anything they don’t want in the final draft. Most people want to be honest about their lives.

This is not about showing off or saying, ""Look at my interesting life."" Life is moving quickly, and we often forget our history. Writing these stories helps people connect with their roots. Many people want to leave a legacy for their descendants.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to write the life story. She organizes the material and writes it well. The final product looks professional and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. She receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the high cost stops many people from using her service. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I’ve worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted in the past."""
CAE_24,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures in the world, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to know that none of the sculptures are real. All the sculptures are accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are many: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

**B. Cambridge Darkroom**  
Cambridge Darkroom is a photography center with community darkrooms and a gallery that shows a variety of photography and related media. We regularly offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows all members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (ages 12 to 16) to improve their skills through our Young Members program, led by our resident photographer. We sell photography books and magazines and have a full range of photographic materials.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and parts of the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, created by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and took care of the Woodward collection. Throughout his life, he greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to see the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern uses.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs across Great Britain. These photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human activities from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with any questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These copies are made to order and typically take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, making it one of the most unique tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. The brass plates were an alternative way to remember the tomb statues and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have been lucky to spend 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding my baby, which is what being a father means to me. I feel very fortunate with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become more of a friend than just a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have sometimes slapped my children in anger, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am available if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me first. If I start asking them why they haven’t contacted me, it makes them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities quite annoying. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected to what was happening. Because I was busy building my business when they were young, I missed some important events like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with many of our friends and join us at parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting and glamorous.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for our children, but as I became more involved in politics, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my kids can come with me. If I didn’t do this, they would feel left out. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their children to work. Maybe we are all realizing how important it is to include our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about fatherhood than I might have otherwise. I worked hard to stay connected with my children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents from the Seventies, I think I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate recently said that we were too lenient. I believe I could have set more rules and structure. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach, and I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your children never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice house, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter Betty has helped me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. It is a humbling experience. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but just one smile from her makes all the irritation go away. A baby's smile is the best way to make you feel better."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other plane. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the inside was very different. It was a long white tunnel with few windows and lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.

For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring up and then diving down. The pilot would turn off the engines at 3,000 meters, allowing the plane to rise higher for a moment before gravity pulled it back down. During the few seconds of weightlessness, the students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.

The flight started smoothly, but the students quickly realized this was not a normal passenger flight when the pilot made the plane climb steeply for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and the students felt the blood rush from their heads as they were pushed against the cabin floor. Then, the engines stopped, and they experienced weightlessness almost immediately. 

For 20 seconds, they floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. They could move in any direction, but it was confusing because up and down no longer made sense. After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, and some students landed hard.

After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of ""space time"" for their experiments. The Dutch students studied the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to find out how cats always land on their feet. They released their device, which floated upside down, and one student managed to turn it right side up using a remote control. 

Another student almost landed on it during a rough return to gravity. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joints changes without gravity, which could help in building future space stations. A team from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They believe that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, the students felt a mix of excitement and instability. Most felt exhilarated rather than sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which I enjoyed because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is suitable for planting trees.

I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I think my family became enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember it as a happy time since I was often wet and cold. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for the next planting session. I would come out of the Land Rover, warm and dry, but then face the rain, with my jacket still damp from the day before, my boots soaked, and my hands struggling with slippery laces. “The brain starts to think about many strange ideas and reflections about life.”

In that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very useful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it’s heavy, and it only gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line. These poles help you plant in a straight line. Once you are lined up, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the fewest movements needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You train your body to do a series of standard moves, making it much easier. You develop a regular process: taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it was interesting. My brain started to think about many ideas and reflections about life. A lot of my thoughts about nature and our place in it began during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984, alone for three months. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. In many ways, it is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth. It is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**BRINGING UP BADGERS**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they often die from hunger without being found. 

These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still trying to suckle. I could see the cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth first to mimic their mother’s licking. This helped them to go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, although a bit unsteadily. They were happy with each other’s company and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed weak, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet discovered that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it is important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can go into their lungs. In Willow’s case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, especially for such a small cub. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two cubs. 

Then, six days later, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return because the area was too disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon found out why his mother had left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle’s teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. 

By the time they were nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, my badgers started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would get excited and chase each other’s tails. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with bruises.

During these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food because their own areas were not providing enough. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive, so we were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs. To protect them, we covered the gate with sheet metal. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and we started a campaign to build a sett for them on the farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside.

As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and their bedding than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline helped fund part of it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a proper home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle down. Half an hour later, I returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep.

Now, my walks with them are less frequent, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding declination was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley was one of only two people in England at that time who were paid to do scientific research. He set out for the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic, but his first trip was cut short due to problems with the crew. He later made a second voyage that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.

Dr. Clark, who enjoys sailing, wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting the journey, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him.

Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous work, *Principia Mathematica*, which is the basis of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with more advanced tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.

Dr. Clark explains, ""We usually measure the strength of the magnetic field, but not its direction. To measure direction, we need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use global positioning satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the journey. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.

Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian to be appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. 

Does Dr. Clark have the skills to make his journey successful? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's passion? ""I am ready to dedicate eight months to this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior puzzles scientists, including Charles Darwin, who wondered how such a showy feature could help birds survive in a competitive world. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, where the strongest and smartest survive and reproduce. However, he thought that the peacock's tail was a burden and suggested a different idea called ""sexual selection."" This means that females might choose males based on their beauty.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed with him. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be a reason beyond just beauty. Wallace thought that the tail might signal some hidden quality that helps the males survive.

Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to answer these questions. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live in a natural environment but are used to people, making them easier to study. Marion Petrie and her team are investigating two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most beautiful tails? And do these males have other advantages, or is it just about looks?

The researchers have observed that the hens seem to prefer males with the most eye spots on their tails, which are also longer. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free from parasites, and their bright feathers could show this. However, Petrie and her team have not yet been able to check for parasites in the peacocks at Whipsnade.

This year, Petrie is studying the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the children of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that the females' choice is practical.

There is also an interesting theory from the mathematician and biologist R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will prefer long tails. This could lead to a situation where males with the longest tails have the most mates, and the preference for long tails continues to grow. Modern computer models show that this process could explain the evolution of the peacock's tail and support Darwin's idea that females might eventually choose beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He showed this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is filled with beautiful yachts that have the latest technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although she was designed last year, she looks like she is 100 years old, which might make you think her owner is a romantic. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.

My boat uses the best parts of traditional boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, it is important to note that advanced technology often keeps sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing. I am not saying that sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if everything is done for you? Dealing with a sail that flaps in the wind is part of being a sailor.

Why should we change the steering position from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot near the front? The sad truth is that this makes the inside of the boat feel like a big house, with a bed larger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said she had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over time, I learned how true that was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I ever sailed.

However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care because they are old. When I hurt my back badly, I realized I could no longer take care of her. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing good, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are skilled with computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before using a computer. After creating a model, just like boat builders did in the past, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the water, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This might be because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. This traditional method works well. In her calmness, she shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. So, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes, yoga, and other activities. The instructors are very well trained. I was surprised at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, really makes you feel refreshed. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I will definitely return. This is a perfect getaway for busy working women. Save Room 5 for me!

The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, including an examination of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem found during the check-up was quickly shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You can enjoy a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not pretend to be one. It is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after enjoying the food. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens in the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a famous restaurant, has amazing dishes. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about all the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments. Cliveden has all these options if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a problem if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best sleep I’ve had in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would like to take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences. Genetically, we are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the things that make us different from animals are very recent. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other unique human traits come from just a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for a few genes.

Recent studies of animal behavior show that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for warnings like 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings suggest that there are not many absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. We only have clear evidence of human art from around 35,000 years ago, with famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we believe that our recent burst of creativity makes us different, we need to consider how our art is different from animal art. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is made for enjoyment, and it is learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, like defending territory or attracting a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by enjoyment. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during the breeding season, suggesting they do not sing just for pleasure. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris, but people can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs, even if they have never heard them before.

Human art styles change quickly. For example, Roman authors wrote about geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. However, human art evolves so fast that even casual museum visitors can tell that a painting from the 20th century is newer than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when and who painted a work, but they might confuse two mid-20th century artists named Congo and Betsy. In reality, these artists were chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment, and he got upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These paintings by our closest relatives blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not created for practical purposes; they were made for the satisfaction of the painter. You might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend to communicate with others, while the apes did not care about sharing their art. However, this argument is not very strong, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. In the past, children's stories featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. Today, such characters are rare in stories and in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, which means ""once entered, you never come out."" Local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have cost everyone their lives and made the expedition very difficult.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back since no one had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.""

Anyone reading his amazing story will be surprised by the word ""kind."" The team faced terrible challenges: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn't experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn't mean we didn't struggle the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do this now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet, when I think of my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. By that measure, the desert does not compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We were motivated by a sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,"**Text: Life Without Gadgets**

Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful devices that make life easier and save us time. However, this belief can be misleading. For example, using our fingers does not use up energy like our machines do, and doing things by hand does not harm the environment. 

After a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost a lot to fix, Susan began to think that gadgets are often not worth the money or the hassle. She started to let her household gadgets break down naturally. This made her question what ""time"" technology really gives us. Does it just allow us to do more things that require even more gadgets? 

When her broken machine started making strange noises, she decided to leave it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys not being tied to a noisy machine and can take her time with her sewing. Although she appreciates some gadgets, like her washing machine, she found joy in living without others. 

For example, they returned their rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped them spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. Susan has taken up sewing by hand since her old sewing machine is now just a table for plants. 

People often think they cannot live without their gadgets, but Susan believes that life can be better without them. She enjoys sewing while listening to the radio or talking with family. If the task is simple, she can even watch her favorite TV shows while sewing, which makes her feel less guilty about watching TV. 

Sewing by hand is not as hard as she once thought. It is relaxing and satisfying to see her work improve. She finds that things get done quickly, and she can enjoy a slower pace of life. She also enjoys washing dishes by hand, which allows her to daydream. 

Now, Susan looks around her home and wonders if they really need all their gadgets, like the freezer or microwave. She realizes they could save a lot of money by living without some of these electric devices."
CAE_62,"**Text: The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst**

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes a living by creating beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, which is located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is hard to tell if he is really in a hurry or just acting tough. Looking around the workshop, I see that he is indeed busy, with many pieces of furniture and wooden planks in different natural colors.

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a good reputation. His order book is always full for several months ahead, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right person to contact. 

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, as the craft is still alive in the countryside. However, it is harder to find a cabinet-maker who focuses on making well-crafted furniture with clean, simple designs. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people call themselves furniture-makers."" He has high standards and is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He criticizes mass-produced items and craftsmen who make poor-quality pieces. This desire for perfection is a big part of Hurst's success, along with his talent. He is confident in his skills and says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things.""

Hurst learned his craft on his own. He explains, ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up."" Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return to him for more projects. He enjoys doing complete jobs for their homes, but he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want until it is too late. He prefers clients who are clear about their needs.

Although Hurst is proud of his work, he also recognizes the talent of others. He says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He is critical of craftsmen who take too long to make one piece and of students who focus on making fashion statements with their work. He believes that furniture should be practical and useful, not just a statement.

Hurst may be confident and direct, but he is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and help us feel better.

The second theory focuses on learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It says that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted rules of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and strange habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the editor about various topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality. 

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism is the desire to be unique, while conformity is the desire to fit in. For many people, the need to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out. 

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests or concerns. The key word here is 'common.' They seek others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group can be comforting.

Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be different. Even when we follow the crowd, we may feel the need to show our individuality. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" or a new acquaintance might declare, ""You must take me as I am."" 

Anyone can choose to embrace their individuality at any time. Many successful people have done this. For instance, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it without giving up, you will surprise many people."" However, this self-assertion is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is that it is natural. 

Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. A true eccentric does not care much about what others think. They act according to their true selves. This makes eccentrics different from enthusiasts, pranksters, clever criminals, show-offs, and recluses. These people are aware of society and often react to it. Some want to impress others, while others want to escape from society. But eccentrics live their lives freely, without concern for what others think."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet many important people in this field. One of the most significant is Barbara Ward, a small and delicate woman who has greatly influenced environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these complex topics. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" However, I believe her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" Although its title sounds old-fashioned, it focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a powerful call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book beautifully explains the interesting world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see that their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's simple yet effective paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to an exciting career in conservation. It defined my love for the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, reading this book made me feel hopeful again. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some people think humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living beings as a family, connected and inseparable. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered so much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five important British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people say they buy a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more relaxed about bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own feelings about a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a problem with not enough attention given to paperbacks, which many people read. Weekly reviews often do not cover enough books, and even original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several positive reviews.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books. Most of our books are not by famous authors, so we rely on literary editors to give us space in their publications. Good reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can help launch a book and even a writer's career, but they need to work together with other factors like recommendations from readers and effective marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the United States, it is straightforward: a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for people to notice a good writer. Interestingly, some poorly reviewed books become bestsellers. The situation is unpredictable, but non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than on the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would pay attention. Today, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

Making weathervanes is an old skill that dates back to ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special item just for them,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something special that reflects the man's job or hobbies.

Graham's work is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked the surprise gift he made for his wife and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he explains. 

Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change their roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available because they are still very popular. ""People like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They want something a little different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something almost lifelike,"" he explains. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds that more people are moving to the countryside and want to add special touches to their homes, which helps crafts like his.

Graham is now busier than ever, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world. He has noticed a lot of interest from buyers in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a tough time. A film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He felt disappointed and worried because he hadn’t earned any money in two years, and the film was his only hope to calm his angry bank manager. A sensible person in his situation would have found a job, maybe returning to television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel.

Although this decision seemed impulsive, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. He had met a farrier on Dartmoor who told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive. The horse's owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These special people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans, who initially wanted to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after his disappointment with the film industry, he decided to write it as a book.

During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He later reflected, ""It was a strange time. I was observing people, but I felt very alone and like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and worried about how to support my children.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from the bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked about the potential advance, he suggested Evans might get $30,000. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had at least two months of work left. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with the summary, to seven UK publishers just before they went to the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""You what?"" The agent replied, ""It's OK, I just feel something big is happening.""

What happened next is now famous in publishing. Within a week of intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans said, ""We couldn't believe it; we just sat there in shock. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don’t know how it got there."" They also didn’t send it to Hollywood, but soon major film studios were competing to buy the rights. Evans's UK agent wisely involved an American agent, who called to say, ""I think we can get $3 million."" They all laughed in disbelief.

As they agreed on this amount, the studios wanted to present their ideas to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called one after another, hoping to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me while we enjoyed coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It’s been like a fairy tale so far. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very hard, and I don’t want to become just an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much money. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become more of a young person's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. He won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, he is 49 years old, out of practice, and not in great shape. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time, or they lose the game. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This increased pressure favors younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30.

The way chess is played has also changed. Much of it now happens off the board. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially because computers have changed the game. A small computer can store one million chess games and provide quick access to many games of an opponent. In recent matches, players have used large teams to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can be the key to winning.

Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense situations, players must act quickly and decisively, similar to athletes.

At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess masters must be ready to compete again the next day. Most tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in 1984 had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10 kg during that time.

Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game seem strange. However, it also made him a legend. If he has returned for the money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.

**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" Nick is very talented, but what is surprising is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it can cause. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was copying him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always meant to succeed. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid doing homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes serious. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but I just want two people to buy it and be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt really down, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won many awards and honors, more than most people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and realized I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more words that could be bad. My main goal is to avoid just producing work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn’t want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance stories and is looking for the right man. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired,"" similar to the dramatic pace of early silent films.

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart but shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon features a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the gentler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with old stores, classic cars, and radio shows.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife’s first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife’s ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author untangles these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a fun and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters and become deeply involved in their lives.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a great American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make up for it, he becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor while dealing with everyday life. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international volunteer work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work has a big impact on development. While volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a lot of money to participate in these projects. This money could be better used if donated directly to local communities, as it could pay for more labor than one volunteer can provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have the necessary skills or experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are truly motivated by a desire to help others or if they are more interested in improving their own careers. However, these projects can help develop people who may act ethically in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and greater participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help create international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the overall benefits can be greater than the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and local communities. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may only benefit them and not the communities that need help. Those who volunteer may continue to gain advantages while using local organizations and communities for their own growth.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that is more about helping wealthy Westerners than the communities they visit. It can also provide important technical assistance for development. When done well, international volunteering can benefit both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the sharing of skills and experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and commitment to fighting against poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the growing trend of wanting to help others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially in a time when people are skeptical of big governments and businesses. However, this focus on individual charity can ignore the need for democratic solutions and can reduce development to simple acts of kindness, which may not change the difficult situations faced by poor communities. While volunteering is a good act, when it is promoted as a solution for sustainable development, it can weaken the true understanding of development issues. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from the real problems of global inequality and poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and we often need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group that included me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges tested five different models available now.

One model has a 'dual alarm function' that lets you set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. However, it does not let you snooze and then wake up later as I first thought. This model costs about the same as another one we tested, but it has a cassette player, which is a nice feature. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to a quiet morning. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was a problem; it was as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can easily tap it while still half-asleep. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which caused some confusion when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out, which we all liked. But we found it difficult to set up, even though figuring it out made us feel cool and sophisticated.

Tom Granger thought another model, which has a built-in lamp, was 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was hard to position, and you couldn’t read by it since it only lit up the clock, which was already bright. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, which made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people, with its bright colors and fun design, which appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said, 'I would choose this one because it stands out more than the others.' 

The traditional controls made this model the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual says, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time.' Paul Bridges laughed at this idea and said the model was 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space,' and it had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, 'It's easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed all the buttons correctly, so you can’t be confident it will work.' He agreed that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All types of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked, which makes their spines point outwards. This is a good way to protect themselves, but it depends on how many spines they have. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines. Because of this, they are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using their rolling ability only as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs will stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is difficult, even for men, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competing take up a lot of time, leaving little room for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's a wonderful feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well, or the weather is bad, but I just keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside of skiing because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally - it’s a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing since I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not because I am a great cyclist. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because very few schools offer it. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Also, coaches often change, so the women’s team lacks stability. But I enjoy it and love being fit, plus there is a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how big it is! I felt trapped in Britain and wanted freedom. Each walk has been different. Walking across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with very little sleep and had many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, men think they must beat me, so I have had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are joining racing every year. I love saloon car racing because I always aim for perfection.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before a race, and I really push myself during the race. I often wonder why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the articles focus on the men’s events, and only 10% mention the women’s. The prize money is also not as good. But we have created an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to improve this."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could recognize Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have approached him if my friend hadn’t encouraged me. Nervously, I introduced myself and asked for his signature, and to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of my sketchbook and then added some lively lines below. These lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a conversation, but since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was not great either, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. Still, I told Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend what I had. He noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and encouraged me to go back and talk to him again. 

So, with my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided not to ask if I could draw his portrait, as I was afraid he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, set up my pad, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled and made it hard for me to concentrate. He acted out funny faces and gestures, making it a challenge to draw him. Even though it was difficult, I felt he was testing my determination.

Eventually, Picasso relaxed and let me study him without distractions. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were full of life. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed to be in his own world, quietly focused on his thoughts.

When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with just one lively line. 

I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks. I thanked Picasso and asked if he could sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he was not going to give me another one! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? This article explains the tricks that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**  
Supermarkets know that customers like fresh food. They often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store feel fresh. Some stores even have bakeries that fill the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are also chosen to make customers think of fresh produce. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**  
The way products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas of the store customers visit the most. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are more likely to be bought, so manufacturers want their items placed there. Special bins with discounts attract bargain hunters. Stores also place related items together, like desserts near ice cream.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, customers pass by more expensive items on their way. Stores may also put popular products far from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and see other tempting products along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from the idea of selling many items cheaply. Instead, they create a boutique feel by showing fewer items, making them seem exclusive. Their success comes from good store design as well as stylish clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**  
Food shoppers often pay more attention to the total cost of their shopping than to the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with more expensive items. They sometimes sell staples at a loss to attract customers, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They also get low prices by buying in large amounts or by promoting products prominently.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**  
Customers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and notice prices more. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft by making staff ring up sales for small change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores pay attention to lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh foods look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**  
Many chain stores use different types of carpet to guide customers through the store. The main paths are often marked with one pattern, while sales areas have another. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use nicer carpets in sales areas to encourage customers to explore.

**I. In-Store Promotion**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see large pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and can increase sales significantly."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, 58, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*, he called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing techniques, and Robin could show Chris how to sail. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to shore to practice climbing.

The climbing route was challenging, but Chris was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. When they reached a steep drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. After Chris finished, Robin politely asked if he could climb down using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while Chris wanted him to use his legs. Chris was not very happy about it, but Robin managed to lower himself down safely.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin formed a strong friendship. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a big step from their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked for everyone's opinion first. Most of the time, people were too afraid to give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making.

To be honest, Chris found sailing difficult and boring. He preferred the excitement of dealing with problems, but he struggled with spending many days at sea. He was not a natural sailor like Robin, who enjoyed fixing the engine and other tasks. Chris sometimes felt useless and found it hard to be so close to the other crew members on a small yacht designed for four people, but they had six on board.

When they reached Greenland and it was Chris's turn to lead the expedition, he felt nervous about being responsible for Robin's safety. There were times when Robin could have fallen and taken Chris with him, so Chris had to be very careful. He underestimated how hard it would be to climb the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain. Robin was not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin trusted Chris completely and just followed him. When it became too difficult, Chris knew they had to turn back, and Robin accepted this decision. 

Chris also knew that Robin was worried about their boat and whether it would be safe in the ice. Still, Robin wanted to try climbing the mountain again. The only time they had a serious disagreement was on the yacht on the way home. They were taking turns to keep watch. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his shift, but Robin decided not to wake him, thinking he could handle it alone. Chris had almost fallen asleep the night before and felt that Robin did not trust him. He expressed his feelings, and Robin quickly reassured him that he had misunderstood the situation.

While they enjoyed their trip to Skye, they did not truly get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. Chris discovered that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for a very long time, with many different types in various colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this important part of our history.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored dried apple halves for the winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we eat today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and this knowledge was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but many did not grow well in Britain. After the Norman Conquest, new apple types became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became common in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known for its pear-like shape, was a popular dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century. However, due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, apple production decreased, and more apples were imported. In the sixteenth century, King Henry VIII sent his fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many new apple types, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them. Captain Bligh from the Bounty brought apples to Australia, and Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa. The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower also carried apples to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple nurseries across several states. He was seen as a kind man and became a part of many stories.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa found a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. When he showed it at a fruit event, a judge tasted it and called it 'Delicious'. In 1895, this apple was sold as 'Delicious' and became very popular worldwide.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was the daughter of convicts but chose to live a different life. As a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales, she took care of her family’s farm. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She moved it, and soon she was harvesting green apples that became famous worldwide. She said, ""It’s just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, from India to Africa. However, most apples come from only a few varieties, chosen for their appearance or how well they travel, not for their taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as it reduces the different types of apples available. While some gardeners in the UK have kept old apple types alive, many varieties in the US have been lost. However, consumers are starting to want more variety. We cannot rely only on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity; we must work to protect and value the natural variety of apples and other foods for everyone’s benefit."

It’s hard to describe Explore Worldwide because each trip is unique. We have divided our adventures into 8 categories, each highlighting special activities. These highlights, along with unique places, local customs, and personal experiences, contribute to the enjoyment of your holiday.

**Cultural/Adventure**

Most trips have a strong cultural aspect. Some focus mainly on local cultures, ethnic groups, and historical sites. For example, trips to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Greece, India, and more offer rich cultural experiences. Short walks of 2-4 hours to visit less-known sites are often included.

**Wildlife and Natural History**

Our wildlife safaris take you to some of the best game parks in the world, allowing you to see animals in their natural habitats. In Africa, you can explore the wild on foot, track mountain gorillas, or go canoeing. Most safaris involve camping, but some offer hotel stays.

**Ethnic Encounters**

A highlight of our adventures is meeting ethnic or tribal peoples, such as the Tuareg of the Sahara or the Maya of Mexico. Many of these cultures are at risk, and we aim to promote understanding and respect while minimizing cultural and environmental impact.

**Easy/Moderate Hiking**

Many trips include easy walks through beautiful countryside, often staying in rented accommodations or hotels. Some involve village-to-village hiking, where you might stay in local homes or simple huts. Your main luggage is transported separately, so you only carry a small daypack.

**Major Treks**

We offer a few challenging treks for experienced hikers, sometimes at high altitudes. These trips may include staying with local people or camping in famous mountain ranges like the Himalayas or the Andes. Support vehicles and porters are usually provided.

**Wilderness Experience**

Exploring remote wilderness areas is an exciting adventure. You can discover the beauty of places like the Amazon Rainforest or the Sahara Desert, offering experiences few people ever have.

**Sailtreks/Seatreks**

These are relaxing holidays where we use local boats to explore. We sail through Upper Egypt, travel on wooden yachts in Turkey, and cruise the Galapagos Islands.

**Raft and River Journeys**

Our river trips can last from a few hours to several days, ranging from easy paddling to thrilling whitewater rafting. No experience is needed, and safety skills are taught quickly. These journeys provide a unique view of the landscapes and wildlife along the rivers."
CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner from Britain, visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is located ten miles south of the equator, on a beautiful mountain track that leads to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. For the past three years, Nerurkar has trained in this area during the winter, but he had never trained with Kenyan runners before. On his fourth trip, he decided to change that. He participated in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race.

Training at high altitude helps runners produce more red blood cells, which improves their ability to carry oxygen. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. Nerurkar's first race in Africa was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, but he felt he had done well.

Nerurkar believes that Kenyan success is not only due to the high altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple and relaxed approach to running, and they genuinely enjoy competing. However, the most important question is how they train. During his time at the training camp, he learned about their training routine. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The living conditions are basic, with athletes sharing rooms in dormitories.

Each day, the athletes follow a strict training schedule that includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Their day starts at six in the morning, and they cover about 40 kilometers daily, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. 

Life at the camp is simple. They prepare for breakfast with just a splash of water and a quick brush of their teeth. Breakfast includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After training, they often go to bathe in streams that flow from Mount Kenya's glaciers.

By the end of his stay, Nerurkar gained a deeper understanding of why Kenyan runners are so successful. Their achievements cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. He believes that the simplicity of their mountain lifestyle, their hard training, and their passion for running are key reasons for Kenya's success in distance running."
CAE_7,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem started in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The decline in advertising is happening all over the world. The main issue is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For big items like cars, you might only buy one every three years, and many people get their cars from their jobs. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even if you include all the other products and services you buy, it is likely that you do not purchase more than 400 different brands in a year.

Now, compare that to the 32,500 brands that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend very little on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are analyzed by Media Register. The average person buys only 400 of these brands, which is about 4 percent. This means that a large amount of advertising is wasted. When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. Most people find that only about 6 percent of the ads are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent of the ads are likely wasted.

You might think you are different and that you do not respond to advertising, but most people feel the same way. The truth is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always some waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. Many ads have shown that they work. Advertisers need to reach a large number of people to find the few who will respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested.

Even with careful targeting, advertisers cannot avoid all waste. For example, even the best direct mail campaigns do not get a 100 percent response rate. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every person they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all; they could contact those people directly.

Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is considered successful. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be very happy with a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can attract 2 percent of the population is very successful, even though that is a small part of the total population. While mass media can be a cost-effective way to reach people, advertising needs to be more focused than ever to succeed again."
CAE_43,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Greenest Home**

Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting features. First, it is home to Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral famous for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen. Second, it has the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is known as the greenest home in Britain.

The Vales have created a house that uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost for the garden, and heats the house using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located about 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's older buildings and received approval from planners, even though it is in a conservation area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Once inside, you must take off your shoes, as Robert insists on this. The atmosphere is calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow, as the house is designed to be draught-proof. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to also avoid using mains water. They designed special toilets that compost waste, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.

Robert explains that they want to show people it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness. The only medieval feature of the house is its design, with a hall that includes the fireplace and staircase, reaching the full height of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.

Soon, they will install solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden, which will help the house generate more electricity. While they will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances, they expect to produce extra electricity, enough to eventually charge an electric car. The only heating source is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they only use during the coldest winter days.

When Charles visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but Robert said it felt comfortable because there were no draughts and everything was at the same temperature. He noted that people in the past were comfortable at lower temperatures due to their clothing. He suggested that those living in older homes should consider going back to how people lived before 1900, although this idea may not be popular.

The secret to the house's success is its simple design, which means there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were sourced from local builders and installed by local craftsmen, making it affordable to build—costing the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are not keen on this idea."
CAE_51,"**The Camera Never Lies**

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational and scientific man. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof of these tiny creatures. He published the photos with an article where he accepted fairies as magical beings. 

It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the simple trick showed that a basic idea about photography is wrong: that the camera cannot lie. 

In fact, the camera can lie, and it always has. Today, we often use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured the human imagination, and blacksmiths, the people who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were made by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron features. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with manufacturers of gates and balconies often calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks with extra decorations.

Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and several events in the coming weeks aim to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are now more aware of the craft. 

Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it more easily. Dawson explains, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces are on display, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork.

Dawson has created an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow into shape when it’s hot, saying, ""It's like drawing with metal in space."" Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it’s very soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable.""

Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by dark castles often seen in horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another resembles a Celtic cross. She loves how steel feels cold and hard, and how it seems to last forever. No other metal can provide as much visual pleasure or a sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used for decorative purposes for many years to come, as long as we don’t have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying for me too. 

The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn’t plan to stop smoking, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, and I still do. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session in Birmingham called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop myself; it wouldn’t be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, and I thought it was reasonable to expect that their method wouldn’t work on me. I really enjoyed smoking; it made me happy.

The counselor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge, the idea of quitting began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that was just for me. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it wasn’t a problem at all. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing things at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I am starting to think that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—like eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. Georgina Ferry has been testing her friends to see if they recognize Hodgkin. When she tells them she is writing a biography about her, she watches for their reactions. If they seem surprised and say things like, ""Isn't there already a biography?"" they pass the test.

Hodgkin deserves to be known because she achieved something very special. She won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964 for her work on important substances like penicillin and vitamin B12. She was a remarkable person, and her life shows the changes in the 20th century, such as the growth of women's education and the global nature of science.

When Georgina started her research, she wanted to read biographies of scientists. A friend suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of Hodgkin and also won Nobel Prizes. However, when she went to the bookstore, she found that there were no biographies of Pauling available. This surprised her, even though Pauling was a very important chemist.

Many people, including scientists, think that biographies of scientists are often boring. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, once said that the lives of scientists are usually dull. This belief makes it hard for publishers to sell books about scientists. Most biographies in bookstores are about famous artists, writers, or politicians, not scientists.

It is not true that scientists have less interesting lives than people in the arts. Some scientists are careful about how they present themselves in public. For example, a well-known geneticist said he would not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This attitude can make science seem less inviting to young people.

Fortunately, things are changing. More scientists are appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives out awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help people see scientists as real individuals, not just researchers.

The world of publishing is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and often ignored the personal lives of scientists. However, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" have shown that scientists can have interesting and funny stories. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are shown with their flaws, making them more relatable.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her work and also had a family. She had three children and a husband who was often away for work. While her personal life may not seem directly related to her scientific achievements, it shows how she balanced different parts of her life. 

Hodgkin's passion for science was a big part of who she was. Communicating this passion is a challenge for biographers because many readers may not understand complex scientific ideas. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that many educated people do not recognize the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Farmers whose wells have dried up often ask for her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground is called dowsing. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One of the most believable ideas is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers believe they can sense these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

Recently, during dry years, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers include people with remote cottages or barns that are now holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. There are also golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She says, ""You can't drill a well if there is a risk of waste getting into the water supply. The water we find is in cracks of solid rock, and if we bring it up correctly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, there are many minerals, so we have to be careful about iron.""

Electricity is also needed to run the pump, but it can be too costly to bring power across long fields. So, it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. After considering these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. It will swing when she is above an area with water.

Once she has identified possible locations on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick. The stick is forked and equal in length and width on both sides. She says, ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is very important to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret's husband also checks the same area. Usually, they agree on where to drill, but if they disagree, they will keep looking until they find a spot they both agree on.

Margaret is not alone in her abilities; many researchers and writers have been interested in this mysterious skill. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard for her family to continue their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? It might be fun to try something completely different! We arranged this for four people. Here’s how it went.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda is 23 and a mother of two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant. 

Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. It was very different from her hometown, and she felt nervous. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when Amanda tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and told her it happens to everyone.

By 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers outside, and Amanda felt even more nervous. She worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was done with a computer system. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to her, she had to say, ""Pardon?"" which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and just wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, and Amanda realized how tiring waitressing could be. She thought it was an easy job, but it actually requires a lot of energy and a friendly attitude. Amanda is quite shy, and she knew she couldn’t handle the busy Saturday nights. She was also disappointed with the tips she received. In the end, she was happy to return to her children, as being a mother felt much easier after her day as a waitress!

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy, who is 30, was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She had heard that Amanda's daughters could be cheeky, but she thought she could manage. 

When Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have three hours of peace. But she was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded her that she still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry. 

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. But when she brought Sophie home from school, things got chaotic. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and screamed loudly while playing. Cindy thought they would tire out soon, but she was mistaken. She tried to get them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun began! The girls kept asking for glasses of water, which was just a trick to get them downstairs to watch TV. Cindy realized how tiring it is to take care of two small children. There was no time for herself, and the responsibility felt overwhelming. Still, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary is 42 and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a primary school teacher. 

On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt great! She was unsure how to dress for school and hoped she wouldn’t stand out. At assembly, she faced about 400 students and hoped to blend in. 

In class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from Rosemary's school days. She helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There was a lot to do before classes started again. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which she enjoyed, and then a French lesson where the children practiced on her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, Rosemary was exhausted, while the children still had energy. Speaking in front of the class was the hardest part for her. Although teachers have more holidays, Rosemary decided she prefers farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! Rosemary's farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell.

Hilary spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice cream. It was hard not to taste everything! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are not helped quickly, they can die, so they need daily checks. 

After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! Hilary found the day lonely and missed being around children because animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of farming is that there is no time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, making it hard to plan vacations. Rosemary only gets about three days off this year. Farming may seem romantic, but the reality is very different. The income can be unstable, and Hilary wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is surprising how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by forgotten composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces.

When you meet him, he looks younger than his age and has a bright and friendly personality, just like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a television program featured his work and development, filmed in both London and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo, and his music career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to buy him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played the trumpet all the time. His mother found the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra and convinced him to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, quickly recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher from the beginning, someone who loved the trumpet and sought out players worldwide.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and build a relationship with them. From the start, Hardenberger had a talent for finding the right balance and making that connection. He says that even as a child, his unique sound was already recognizable.

Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also avoided orchestras. Hardenberger collected all of Andre's records, and his parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.

At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson wanted him to go to America, it was considered too far and dangerous. Instead, at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud agreed with Hardenberger's view that playing in an orchestra was not for him, comparing it to digging in the garden. Hardenberger knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience.

Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but made it to the second. Fortunately, he already knew most of the pieces for that round too. However, in the final, he faced a concerto that intimidated him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even though he felt he played poorly, people were still listening.

Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what makes his communication special, saying, ""You risk destroying it by trying to explain. The power of music is that it can always move people."""

CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical day looks like for them.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and arrive at work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. There are times when I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed during surgery, but I sometimes worry about the next day. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it is successful, it feels amazing, even if it doesn’t always work. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see outpatients and explain the surgeries. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to patients. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with only a small part for design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they agree, we create budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to ensure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people, and good communication is very important. When their work arrives, I put everything together and send it to the printers. Managing several projects at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always close, and my day is never the same. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to the pub. If a client likes my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be later. I find it hard to relax, especially when I’m busy.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on some days, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which helps me plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude, but most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each place. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local café for breakfast. In summer, I might work until 10 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I have an office at home, so when I return, I check messages and calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually set up a meeting in the evening. We focus on using old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes clients have strange ideas, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. It’s hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows me to be creative.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. I am the assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site workers and solve problems. The contractors start at 6 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we check the contractors' work, it can create tension, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by going through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these are very important to the artists, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, choosing songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also share my vision for the album with the marketing team. I manage budgets and spending. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm, and most evenings I go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule to see if we have any clients visiting that day. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and helping them buy furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000, and we buy from auctions and private clients. Many items need restoration, so I work with restorers and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business. I also visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I usually go home at 5:30 pm, and it takes me about an hour to relax after work.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. I work for about an hour and a half at one station, then take a break and switch to another station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I often read about new air traffic rules between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. This job can be stressful, so I take sick days if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by getting the electronic sales system ready. I make sure someone is watching the cash register and coordinate lunch breaks for the staff. In the morning, I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to quickly gather many books for them. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new book titles with them. I need to decide how many copies of a new title we might sell. I ensure that new titles are delivered on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, and then I close the store and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for multinational companies, warning clients about potential problems in other countries. I provide three services: an online news preview, a security forecast for the next six months, and a travel security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will cover. My first news preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly. I write the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax in the evenings; I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps create change. Leadership is not about being tall or smart. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is very important. A good leader should be able to express their ideas clearly and confidently. Dixon says it’s about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Discovering Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more potential for leadership than they think. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for good management.

**C. Comparing Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first boss led well, while the second just managed poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes that a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a struggling organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different leadership styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead instead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to achieve them. Look at your job and identify areas where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career.

**F. Developing Leadership Skills**  
- Leadership does not just happen; it develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don’t assume everyone will immediately accept your leadership style. It might even push some people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your leadership is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller called ""Abyss."" It tells the story of oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud and his team, remind us of tough heroes from older films by Howard Hawks. The film has great production design and special effects, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of James Jones's novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different take compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is poetic and mystical, Marton's film is more traditional but stays closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has some strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
This film is loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel and is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain, while Vincent Perez is an energetic hero, even if his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, who plays an acrobat-turned-swordsman, might be too serious for this light-hearted film, but he has his good moments. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama elements with so much humor and charm that it works well.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film tells a serious story. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the historical details and not enough on the dark themes of the story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skills. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement back. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic features ""forty-eight international stars,"" according to its promotion. With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened soldiers wait for news about the invasion, are slow and drag on for both the audience and the characters. While it is impressive in terms of logistics, it is best experienced on the big screen. Watching it on video does not do it justice."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed very interesting. The story is about a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the outcome is uncertain until the very end, with a surprising twist in the last pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a strong beginning and follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the rich during the Italian Renaissance. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church secrets, and serious crimes, but we always believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated, and the book is a bit too long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who seems ready to investigate when a strange man suddenly dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, brave and adaptable Leah proves to be a strong character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, who helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thoughtful discussion than usual. Parker always provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, as they investigate an attack and robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and attention to unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book combines romance, money, and violence to create an exciting suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw shows actor Philip Fletcher in a new role as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not how he wants his career to go. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the shift from dark comedy to farce is not his best work.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this book stand out from typical detective novels."
CAE_57,"I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. I have traveled before; after university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I came back, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, I realized I was sacrificing my happiness for my job. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 

I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of my freedom, if only for my friends! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and I’m already behind schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” 

Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m putting it off because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is possible: “People who always say ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are now understanding they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.”

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I come back, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!” 

For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change my approach to live well as a civilian.” There are many reasons for people my age to travel, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today, we have a more flexible workforce. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Some companies even have career-break policies, knowing that if they invest in training someone, that person will return instead of going to a competitor.

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job—and many people aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t forever. Travel allows you to step back and think about your life.” 

Is wanting to travel just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he’s not running away. “I’m running towards something. I want to grab the things I want for myself.” But he also feels nervous. “I’ll miss my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ‘hi’ to everyone, and having coffee.” 

I share Ben’s worries about leaving behind a stable life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult. Jennifer Cox points out that this is common. “There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel.” It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll be proud to have taken this step. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. In this passage, she shares how she changed her home into a productive workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was lost due to technology. A quick look at my resume showed that I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. I felt that no one would trust me with a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was known as the family technophobe; even calculators confused me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to act quickly to fill the gap in my career. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

The children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous, thinking I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I was not very skilled, I learned the basics. It was logical and easy to understand. With practice, I improved a little each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

So, how has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always messy, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track my income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the kids are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment, but also for convenience, avoiding the daily commute to the city.

As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum look very different from the historic city of Edinburgh where it is located. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You cannot miss the new Museum of Scotland. It stands out on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings that look like cheese wedges, topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more cautious or even negative. Now, as the inside is almost ready for visitors, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.

The museum tells the story of Scotland through many interesting displays. It has a timeline to help visitors understand the history, but it does not force them to follow a strict order. The museum also showcases important national treasures, like the jewels of Mary Queen of Scots and silver from Holyrood chapel, without overwhelming visitors with national pride.

The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that visiting should be a fun and visual experience. The museum is designed for everyone, even those who know little about Scotland's history. However, Dr. Clarke is strict about what is displayed. He does not want to show imaginary scenes from the past, as he believes it is important to present the truth.

Visitors will see what experts know about the objects on display. The challenge is whether the stories of these objects can be told clearly using explanation panels, captions, and multimedia displays, with only about 30 computers available in the museum. With less than three days before the opening, it is hard to tell for sure.

Some things are clear, though. The views of Edinburgh Castle are breathtaking. Inside, the layout of the museum is striking. Galleries connect to each other in different sizes and shapes, with pale walls that look like large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light comes through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space where visitors can enjoy each item on display.

Thanks to a group of 12 young people from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. They wanted to create a fun way to explore the displays. Although they did not get to ride through the exhibits, they succeeded in creating a hands-on center for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition area. The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change every three years and features objects chosen by Scottish people that have had a big impact on life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is entertaining, it may not address more serious topics.

Overall, Dr. Clarke is right when he says that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in its location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"**The Future of Print Newspapers**

The end of print newspapers may take a while. The word ""transition"" is nice and calming. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving from the present to the future in a smooth way. However, the change for newspapers to go online is uncertain and uncomfortable. It might not even be a real process.

Many believe that this change will happen eventually. It is well-known that print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.

This might be true, but there are some things that don’t fit this picture. If print sales have not fallen much, maybe the crisis mainly affects newspapers. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries fell, Asia's sales increased significantly. News and current affairs magazines, which are expected to struggle in the digital age, also saw a 5.4% increase.

In short, while some magazine areas are declining, many are growing quickly. A similar trend is seen in books. Sales of e-readers like Kindle are rising sharply this year. However, when booksellers looked at the sales of physical books over the last six months, they found only a small decrease of 0.4%. This shows that people are buying both e-books and physical books.

The idea that young people are completely giving up reading newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries in Europe have different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

These different trends suggest that the situation is more complicated than what many believe about the digital revolution. In the past, American media analysts thought that online advertising would help newspapers succeed online. However, digital advertising on newspaper websites is now decreasing, making those earlier beliefs seem outdated. 

Currently, 360 US newspapers, including many well-known ones, have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital access together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. Print advertising also earns much more money than online ads.

However, maintaining both a website and a print edition is challenging and expensive for newspaper companies. Despite this, print newspapers still have a strong presence, while being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The camera can also change how people behave.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of the camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. Avoid having the subject look away from the camera, as this can make the picture less interesting.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the photo. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it gives the viewer a sense of observing a moment. Candid shots can be very captivating, and the subject's expression is important.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they are a quick way to communicate feelings.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more context. When including a background, avoid distracting details. Make sure the subject stands out against the background, which can be done by using a wide-angle lens.

**H. Interaction**  
Photos of people interacting, like talking or laughing together, often make great pictures. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams can create appealing shots. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a friendly gesture.

**I. People and Places**  
Many pictures of people are taken during trips. To improve these photos, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or landscape. Position the people close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. A slightly higher camera angle can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met on holiday, a clear posed picture is good. However, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, creating better memories for the future."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work unless someone asks them to, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting magazine interview. She admits, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she even gets nervous when asked to be photographed.

After a little time, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and entertaining conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she spent two years drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not satisfied with illustration and decided to work with a well-known decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that sparked her interest. She left to start her own career, not knowing exactly where it would lead, but feeling hopeful.

Sarah's ability to observe details, which she developed through her illustration work, is very important for her art. She often gets asked where people can learn trompe-l'oeil, but she believes it cannot be taught. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she explains. She is always learning and believes that if you think you have mastered something, you should give up.

Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math, especially when she had to measure for a large project on a chapel ceiling. She thought to herself, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" This self-doubt makes her view her talent in a unique way. Sometimes she talks about her work in the third person, saying, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""

Her trompe-l'oeil art is exceptional and stands out from others who have tried to copy the style. She has completed many important projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can enter two more rooms at the end of a hallway.

However, there is a challenge with trompe-l'oeil art: once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. Sarah knows this well. She says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination. That is the most important part.""

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal to the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas about what they want, while others do not. She emphasizes the importance of listening and understanding the client's vision. Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working on their projects. 

Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" 

While this may be true, you could never really get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be more widely recognized, and I am willing to take the risk of making her uncomfortable by praising her."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman looks at the important 'people skills' needed to succeed in your career.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged by a new standard. It is not just about how smart we are or our training and skills, but also about how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly used to decide who gets hired and who does not, and who gets promoted. It helps to identify who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future job opportunities. They focus on traits that are essential for success, which are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not as important anymore. The new standard assumes we all have enough intelligence and skills to do our jobs. Instead, it emphasizes social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are the 'people skills' that make up what we call emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For many years, these qualities were called different names, such as 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills'. Now, we have a clearer understanding of these human abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence'. This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others, and to use these feelings to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice', but sometimes it requires being direct and honest, even if it is uncomfortable. Emotional intelligence does not mean expressing all feelings freely; it means managing feelings so they are shown in a suitable and effective way, helping people work together towards common goals.

C. More businesses are realizing that promoting emotional intelligence is an important part of management. The more complex a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. A lack of these skills can limit a person's ability to use their technical knowledge. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that encourage collaboration have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer focus are important, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.

D. While a person's IQ does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we go through life and learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and add these skills to our toolkit for success, especially now when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, nor does it guarantee success. However, if we ignore the human aspect, nothing else will work as well as it could."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed how people take and share photos. Now, journalists often look to social networks for images during fast-moving events. However, some reporters have used content created by users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, but people still debate if this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take photos or videos of a news event, which means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure that people are fairly rewarded for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health issues, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**A. What is it about?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller meridians that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. Acupuncturists use very thin needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.

**B. Over three hundred points**  
The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine that provides electrical stimulation. Acupuncturists believe this sensation means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less frequently.

**C. Science explains how it works**  
Even though many doctors do not accept the ideas of traditional Chinese medicine, they agree that acupuncture can help relieve pain. They have found scientific reasons for its effectiveness. For example, it is thought that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some scientists believe that acupuncture points can release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.

**D. What types of pain can be treated?**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. Commonly treated pains include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern use of an ancient treatment**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture has real benefits. Today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries in China, from tonsil removals to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. While some people report little to no pain, experiences can vary. Many might find the idea of being awake during surgery unappealing, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of traditional anesthesia, like nausea, and recovery is often quicker.

**F. Effectiveness**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is challenging to conduct clinical trials for acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate. They understand that it may not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement can be felt after just two or three visits.

**G. A different approach to pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists look at their patients as a whole, not just focusing on specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues with the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect the pain, such as weather conditions. These details are important in deciding how to use acupuncture for treatment, which is not something most medical doctors would typically consider.

**H. Traditional or not?**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional Chinese medicine is necessary for deep healing, which can be hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."
CAE_35,"P. D. James is a well-known crime writer, whose gentle appearance hides a deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she has a strong presence that makes you think she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school if she hadn’t become a writer. However, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in solitude. She needs privacy to write and can do it anywhere as long as she is alone.

Although she is often called Britain’s best-known crime writer, she is too humble to agree. Her 12 detective novels are read by millions around the world. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James often reads books by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she believes were the best novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, who was a university student. She chose Cambridge as the setting for one of her books, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman. 

Her life has not always been easy. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill. She had to work long hours to support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she had little time to write. Thankfully, her husband’s parents helped take care of her daughters during those tough years.

While working full-time in the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She managed several psychiatric clinics and later worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in the Criminal Law section. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she loved the challenge of writing crime novels. 

P.D. James always enjoyed reading detective stories and wanted to be a writer. She didn’t want to write about her own life’s difficulties, so she found writing detective stories to be a great way to learn how to write serious novels. She realized that within the classic detective story format, she could still create meaningful stories about people. For her, writing detective stories is a way to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is valuable, even if it is difficult. She believes that nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can play a big role in deciding if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 

More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and as a part of interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not convinced about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. 

Marne says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental ability and whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a tricky or open character."" She believes graphology can be especially useful in identifying possible criminal behavior. She notes that criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which can be poorly shaped and childish. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and show emotional issues, which can be seen in their handwriting.

Marne claims she can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable workers. She observes that young male offenders often have very high letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can also predict if someone might become violent, if they are under a lot of stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even help predict potential suicides. 

She explains that heart and lung problems can also be reflected in handwriting. ""You can't make a diagnosis from just one sample, unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if the handwriting changes over time or becomes disconnected, it could mean something serious has happened."" A major emotional upset can also change a person's signature temporarily.

Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect in a ""thread"" style may be clever but devious. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting, which differs from standard styles, shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often indicates a person who is a loner. Very small signatures can suggest feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter ""i"" show a desire for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can indicate intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Marne believes it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific field, and she believes this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a person's entire history, including their emotional struggles, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite these interesting ideas, there is little strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical of them. They argue that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the type of writing taught, and that it has no other important meaning."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It’s surprising that this space works, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to what they do at home. This may be the key to their happiness: they have created a comfortable working environment without too many rules.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and creates bad sitting positions. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule, which helps reduce fatigue and boredom.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoys the variety of work and the office size. It is small enough to know what others are doing but large enough to focus on personal tasks. The office feels attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, partly because of a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs and lighting are good. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with plain grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve by arranging desks to make sharing information easier.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, with many people around. Despite some smokers, the air quality is surprisingly good.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and uninspiring. The desks are just okay, and not all chairs are suitable for computer work. The setup for computer screens is outdated.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. There are many awards on display, but the wood paneling and brown carpet make it feel a bit dull. The office is busy with activity.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and many people do not have enough desk space. It is also very dusty.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than an office. Many chairs are old and not suitable for people who are shorter. 

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old brown chairs and dirty carpets. There is a lot of room for improvement. The place needs cleaning, and individual achievements should be recognized. The air conditioning needs to be fixed, especially since there are many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations, and everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, does not belong to any social class, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks of it every day. This ancient habit has turned into a big business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed the resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic to chew, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the chewing gum market expanded, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, live a difficult and dangerous life. They travel for miles to collect sap from sapodilla trees in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One of the most concerning is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the ears and nose of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros can climb a tree quickly to cut the bark and collect the sap in a bag below. They then carry the liquid to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is made into bricks.

Life at the camp is also hard, with a boring diet mostly made of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though this work is tough, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the entire Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.

As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. At the same time, gum producers are finding clever ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress (soldiers in both world wars were often given gum). The biggest claim is that it helps reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid forms when we eat, and our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, which protect our teeth. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The hotel has basic facilities, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - Hermitage Hotel, Mount Cook**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After being flown near the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we had to walk down. When we reached the bottom, I was surprised to find this hotel in a stunningly beautiful and wild area. After a tiring climb, it was amazing to relax in luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter music.

**C. MAURITIUS - Paradis Hotel**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel goes along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are found. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find peace along its nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, you can hardly see the hotel among the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - Ladera Hotel**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most beautiful views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and located 1,000 feet high, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel has a colonial style, with mahogany furniture and four-poster beds covered with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - The Splendid Hotel, Istanbul**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is a great place to escape the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very peaceful. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings. The Splendid Hotel is all made of wood, painted white with red domes, and is inspired by a hotel from the French Riviera. Although it is a bit old, it still has a lot of charm.

**F. FRANCE - Chateau d'Etoges, Epernay**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with two swans, the chateau has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, plus complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - The Fairview Hotel, Nairobi**  
The Fairview Hotel is a comfortable place in Africa that avoids unnecessary luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers resting after a safari and planning their next adventure. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and rooms, and decide to stay longer. There are even apartments for those who want to stay for months. The hotel is set on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, making it a great spot to enjoy the African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - Hotel Splendido, Portofino**  
The Hotel Splendido was first signed by the Duke of Windsor. Since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart.

CAE_47,"**Simplified Text:**

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from a hotel with three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.

Before they even enter, Sue feels something is off. The entrance from the car park is through a door with a buzzer, and the long, empty corridor leading to the hotel does not meet her expectations. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" It turns out that most of the hotel’s 15 rooms are empty that night. The only available room is on the top floor, but Sue does not like it. It feels stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

When Sue started her career, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and did not think she was very tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge, saying there might be a blocked drain.

Sue suggests that he should not let guests into that lounge and instead guide them to another one. Greaves listens and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and seems unsure about Sue’s advice. However, not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, for their good service and knowledge about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which makes Greaves hopeful. He asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.

Sue’s job is to tell the truth about the hotel, even if it is uncomfortable. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served her apple pie with his fingers. Some letters she receives include false claims about her attitude or demands for bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says. 

Sue must share her findings with the hotel owner verbally and also write a full report. The hotels pay for her services to help them improve. Fortunately for Greaves, Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in two months to check if the problems have been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While climbing Mt. Everest, Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, which Doug found odd since they were alone. He thought it might be due to low oxygen levels. Doug began talking to his own feet, which were getting cold. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug remembered their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is known as one of the most dangerous mountains. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized how big their task was. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new route to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a new approach for this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was soaked, and they were both suffering. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude. Finally, they reached the summit and celebrated their success.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro after getting a free ride. They got lost in the jungles at the base, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found arrows painted on trees that led them to a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who suggested they join his group to climb a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to take the standard route instead. The wind was strong as they reached the summit, and they camped outside a refuge that night. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, which made Doug consider this goal seriously for the first time.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, and the atmosphere is very refreshing. On December 7, they set off for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was very low due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg and traveled to Elbrus. They had to pay a fee to their guide for bringing foreigners into the area, but it was later waived. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, they climbed, and the weather improved. Two team members went ahead while Doug and another member climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"
FCE_15,"**Style Merchants**

Style affects many parts of our lives today, from clothing to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares some of the fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful and romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the overly frilly look, and instead choose simpler styles. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to cut and make clothes. You don’t have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a timeless navy-blue suit, which has been a staple in women's wardrobes for most of the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many celebrities seek her unique pieces. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Lily Grimson has quickly made a name for herself in the competitive fashion industry. After just four years and a basic art and design course, two of her bags were chosen for a major design exhibition. Her handbags are handmade in the UK and are not just bags; they are glamorous accessories made from high-quality materials like calfskin and silk. A Grimson bag combines style and care, making it special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His unique approach ensures that his clients do not look like they just left a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, and there is a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing people to achieve his styles at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and works as a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain. She also shares floral ideas with top restaurants. Despite having no formal training in floristry, she left her teaching job ten years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements should be simple but strong, with fewer large leaves. For wedding bouquets, she advises that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin has been created after a lot of research into what customers want and nearly two years of work to convert four large 18th-century houses. This approach has allowed the hotel to use the latest technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses the hotel’s computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special services for returning guests, which is important for a five-star hotel. Although the system cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He appreciates its efficiency and the services it offers. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will find the technology in their rooms especially useful. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has brought traditional business center services into the guest rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing them to replace them with newer models whenever needed. DVD recorders can also be upgraded as necessary. Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann says they have worked hard to make sure guests do not feel overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are spacious, well-furnished, comfortable, and welcoming.

The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who already had two Michelin stars for his Dublin restaurant, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change has allowed him to design a new kitchen and improve the dining experience. The hotel also offers better parking than his previous location. For the hotel, having a successful restaurant on-site brings many benefits without financial risks.

With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_24,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path that goes through the garden are full of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan loves. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 

Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" She and Danny got along well. At first, he would say some of her ideas were not worth it, but when she told him she wanted to paint those plants, he understood her vision. 

Susan likes to focus on detailed studies of individual plants instead of painting the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants together, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set the whole thing up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the way flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem boring, but they change all the time.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked like fake ones sold in some shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem just as happy in her garden as they do in their native lands like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t cause serious trouble.

With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects to paint right outside her door, Susan has found it hard to spend time in the garden lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"**Title: Changes in Brackham**

Many trees in the Brackham area were damaged in the strong storms last March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change upset many residents who liked the town's traditional look. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, he was too sick to notice. 

Pelham, a large and healthy man, was seriously ill for the first time in his life with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. He thought the police needed him too much, so he ignored her and tried to keep working. This made him forget things and made him short-tempered. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor because he was too weak to argue. 

After visiting the doctor, he got antibiotics and went home, where Molly sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, he could hardly believe it. Later that evening, he asked if the house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then pulled the sheets over his head. 

On Saturday, after the antibiotics started to work and his temperature went down, he got up and realized that the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room's appearance. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. They had paid a lot for it, but Pelham had no regrets. The garden had given them privacy. 

Now, without the tree, the living room was too bright, showing the old furniture they had brought from their previous home. The view from the window was not nice anymore. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, now stood out with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. ""That's what I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But in the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really trouble us much. The real threat was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by a series of dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling up and getting close to a dangerous level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls as the water rushed over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water rushed down towards its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, angrily pushing against its banks. For three days, we prayed that it would stay below its limits. Luckily, our prayers were answered as the dam held strong and the water began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and appreciate the great power of the river without fear. Thanks to the dam, we feel that our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviews of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. Tom hired him, but he was not mainly a journalist, so he was not very careful when choosing his team.

At first, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover different art forms that did not need special knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to make it more enjoyable. At that time, it felt like a dream to be part of a new newspaper in a busy market. Mark even thought it was unlikely that a millionaire would want to help him personally and pretend to employ him, showing his lack of confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground with one of his reviews, he felt very shy.

However, Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out as planned. They did not meet as a group, so they communicated by phone instead. It turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so Mark decided to focus on film. Without Tom's initial support, they would not have developed the current system where he writes a detailed weekly article about one film. This way of working suits him well. He would not have liked the usual role of a film critic, which requires watching every new film. That routine would make him feel bored quickly. He imagined himself sitting in a screening room on a Monday morning, sighing about having to watch another bad film.

The freedom he has allows him to expand his arguments or, during a dull week, to create something interesting from little material. But what is his role in the public eye? He believes that people choose films based on stars, advertising, or the director. There is also a tendency for people to stick to what they like or avoid what they don’t. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a critic's opinion.

So, if a film review is not really a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark does not feel he has to be ""right"" about a movie. He does not think there should be a specific number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present an argument. He does not see himself as a judge, and he does not want to be one."
FCE_46,"**Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun.""**

**Teenager with a passion for endurance sports**

**WANTED:** A sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. You should be very interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (a love for 100km rides is helpful). You must be able to do all three activities without taking a break.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. This is exciting for the audience, but what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? Why would a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes use when asked similar questions. She explains, ""You swim 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike while still wet. Of course, you get cold. After the 40km bike ride, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you are tired. But it’s really fun, and it’s all worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would end, but I’m afraid that if I stop once, I would want to stop again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, while most people stop when they realize they can’t go any further. She just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That’s why I’m working hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it’s a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

But there is a cost. Her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she says. ""I’m not a party person. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times and achievements.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, isn’t it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about collecting and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults shares this interest. Collecting is a world full of passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember this: only collect things you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They were attracted to the shapes and colors of these pebbles, which were their first attempts to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells just for their beauty.

I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote, cold, and windy part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these items. 

Surprisingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults enjoys this hobby. People collect for many reasons, and one idea is that it gives them control over something in their lives. For me, it is simply something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and pieces of Oriental china. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned more than 4,000 paintings. However, you do not need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many different items, like tulip bulbs and china cups, with great determination. 

I remember the day I convinced another tulip collector to sell me a special one for my collection. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Sadly, this collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall and saw the remains of my furniture and my collection. I was not sure which loss made me sadder.

I have always been interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet gives value to items traded in markets. As small objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. Unfortunately, I threw away both the boxes and the toys!"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work**

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic and talk to important people to understand the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to display. I also create interactive displays, workshops, and theatre to help the public understand the exhibition. I work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, learning how to make the journeys. They find the most direct routes, using one-way streets and making the right turns. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different route because the road is closed. This helps them think of alternative routes.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, and I run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out on a boat to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views, as it is very different from making decisions on a computer. I feel lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. However, I work for a charity, which means I always need to find more money, and I cannot do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I ensure that our publishing program meets market needs and that we keep around 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a motivated team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**No Title**

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. 

The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not a good experience because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it is a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms we would stay in. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles repairs and decoration.

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling widely, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel like we were more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that the others felt our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good.

Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey. 

In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every way."
FCE_67,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. This is her second year as a chalet girl. Sarah, 24, is from West Sussex and works in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated from Oxford Brookes University last summer, where she studied French and History of Art. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a career. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. ""They get a full breakfast - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.""

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower first, but she does not sleep. ""It's not good if you do,"" she says. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great - breakfast this morning was fun - but some weeks are not as good.""

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start at Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe Dick's T-Bar at the end of the night,"" she says. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""when you don’t want to cook breakfast with a headache.""

On Sunday, work starts earlier because breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything - clear breakfast, strip the beds, and get ready for new guests."" If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. ""I think the mountain air affects them,"" she jokes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she has a drink afterward, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press each glove using hot brass hands that looked like they had been flattened. As a little girl, she called them ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" Rita said. 

""Well, you should visit one if you want to write about leather. I can help you arrange that. They are old-fashioned places. The technology has improved, but it’s still similar to what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries in the world. They found 6,000-year-old tanning tools in Turkey. The first clothing was made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is an expert on leather; you should talk to him. If you start a conversation about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers really love their work.""

Seymour then asked, ""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" 

""I can't say I have,"" she replied.

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" he asked.

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child,"" she said.

Seymour laughed. She was innocent and eager to learn, which reminded him of Marie. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but Rita had a similar bright intelligence that filled the house when Marie came home from school, excited about what she had learned.

Seymour said, ""Let’s do something fun. We will take you through the whole glove-making process. Come on! We’re going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""
FCE_71,"**Is It a Tough Job?** 

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss. However, she has one small problem: she hates flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is back on the ground, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning trips, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job. A chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her working behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because golf is his passion. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which usually totals between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You’re not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge about the game, and try to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, and they made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are important for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to taste food at the best restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it’s their choice,"" he says. ""I’d rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in my guaranteed income,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It’s not easy; I have to work hard for them,"" he says. ""I usually write in the mornings. I don’t wake up at dawn, though. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning, using one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help with that."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Outside, there were large piles of soft sawdust. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too.

The other boys looked down from the roof, scared but curious. One by one, they jumped and landed safely in the sawdust, smiling with relief. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes. Eventually, one of the boys suggested, ""Let’s go back up to the roof and jump down again."" They were not very excited, but they climbed back up and started jumping off again, determined to have fun. Soon, only Michael was left on the roof while the others called up to him, ""Come on, Mike. What’s wrong?""

Michael wanted to join them, but he hesitated at the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. He wondered why the jump had not seemed so scary the first time. For a while, the others thought he was just joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but he couldn’t. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, but still didn’t move. The boys began to laugh at him, getting tired of waiting. ""Come on, you’re a coward! Do you think we’ll sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn’t jump, they started to walk away, still teasing him.

Michael called after them, confused about why they were leaving. He stayed on the edge of the roof, staring at the ground for a long time. He felt alone as the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust. He lay there for a long time, and the yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been too scared to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone.

When he got home late for dinner, his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you can’t, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair, always patient. But Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, hardly listened to her. He was still thinking about the boys laughing at him on the sawdust pile."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job seek help from a careers adviser. First, you will write a short history of yourself and then take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will receive a summary of the results, along with suggestions for different careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest organizations that provide career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school during science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that it wasn’t about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometric tests would show an accurate picture of me. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, but I was a bit disappointed to learn that I did poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are glad I never became a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean making a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager at a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts for help. Donna said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to step back and look at my career. I wanted to rethink my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But in the end, I had to think about the cost of retraining in design compared to my financial situation,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I decided to use my existing skills and move into a job that suited me better than insurance. I am now a Public Relations officer. I believe I would have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me understand what I really wanted to do. I have sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.""

Some people feel they would not have made important decisions without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services helped 26-year-old Juliet Greene make life-changing choices. ""After working at a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,"" she said. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I listened carefully to the test results and decided I wanted to study geology. I plan to start a degree course later this year. I think the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the cost. I feel much happier and more positive now.""

However, career advice doesn’t work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either meant a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself. You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To help with this fear, he has tried to create a friendly environment. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This idea is surprising for many people who usually think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome explains, ""If people feel relaxed, entertained, and well-treated, they will forget their past bad experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. Patients wear the headsets during their first check-up, sitting comfortably on the blue couch while watching a film about underwater wildlife as I check their teeth. Then, the headset shows them a special camera view of their mouth.""

Most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit. Another interesting detail is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome wants people to notice with all their senses that this is not a typical dentist visit. He says, ""The smell of surgical spirit can make people nervous if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the pleasant smell in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he takes his work very seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the most important thing. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it is not painful at all.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. He explains, ""I found that when you make things easier for the patient, it also makes things easier for you."" He believes that his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a change towards a less formal style in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like a beautiful salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which comes from South America, is now a huge global business worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, which is about eight percent of all chocolate sales for the year. Only at Christmas do people buy more chocolate. 

Although chocolate production became large-scale in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a name that comes from a spelling mistake in the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it tasted better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another hundred years for the recipe to reach the rest of Europe.

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made by melting solid blocks of chocolate in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids, leading to the creation of milk chocolate.

At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. Then, in 1905, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy image of milk from the English countryside, making it a strong competitor to rich French brands. 

Currently, British people eat about four chocolate bars each week, which has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One new idea is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are turned into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something different.

However, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, remember the challenges faced by those who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master in his craft. He still wants to try new things, like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he focuses on creating beautiful objects from shells. ""Tell me if I am boring you,"" he says as he shows me his work in his apartment. There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is definitely passionate, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them so much. I never planned to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so more people could see my art. They even talked to a gallery owner."" This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened yesterday. The prices for his work are high, around £2,000 for some decorations, but Cooke doesn’t mind giving up space on his wall for them.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Cooke says he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

Cooke wishes he had started this work earlier in life because he believes he could have created even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels limited physically compared to when he began. However, his work is very different from the common shell crafts found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, small pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own methods and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue bought in bulk, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he explains, but the detail and color in his work show that it is not random.

Cooke searches for beautiful, tiny shells not just on the beaches of Norfolk, but also in places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and responds to people who accuse him of damaging beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people walking on them much faster than I can collect them. The ones left behind are broken by the sea. I would never take shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is strong, especially considering the beauty he creates from the shells he finds."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who is both a model and a student. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she is studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about Kira.

The receptionist at Kira's modeling agency told me, ""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late."" I thought to myself that I hoped the bad things I had read about models were not true. Words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent came to my mind. I worried about how late she would be. Would she be an hour late? Three hours? Or would she not come at all? What if she chose to go to the hairdresser instead of meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to talk.

However, when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and accompanied by her mother. She was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. She seemed friendly and down-to-earth, not at all selfish. Kira explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, and her mother looked proud of her daughter.

Kira seems a bit confused by her sudden fame, which is understandable since it was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should join,"" Kira recalled. ""I said no, but she sent some photos anyway."" When Kira learned she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen gave her the confidence to continue, and she performed very well. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work right away.

Now, Kira finds it challenging to balance her two lives as a model and a student. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not kind. ""They say I think too highly of myself,"" she said. This must be hard for Kira, as she is not a self-important person. She explained, ""They think that because I became a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that has changed is that I am more confident, not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The Select agency can call her at any time to offer her a job for the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll join them because I don't know my plans for the next day. I can't really make plans, and sometimes they get canceled, but my friends understand. They don’t complain that I am always busy with modeling.""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career ahead of her, and not many people can say that before finishing their school exams. As I was about to end the interview with this remarkable girl, I asked her what she would like to do if she didn't have her beauty. She paused and said, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the hot lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

They have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to explore. After clearing away plants and finding pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running out of money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a bit deeper to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it looks doubtful, but we have a few people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys, the excitement of gold began to attract the attention of local people as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and residents are cautiously hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are right, it would bring more people here, but I hope millions won’t come and damage the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It’s adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I’ll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots."" They are used to being in such a small space where they cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and then three hours to return to the surface. If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, but Rachel thinks it would not be a pleasant journey.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, they found a large area of underwater volcanoes that were releasing black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This smoke comes out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

Rachel recalls a frightening moment during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. She felt a huge bang as shock waves hit their vehicle and thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before."" Rachel studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD, and when she finally saw them in person, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by different train schedules, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I returned home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month.

Sleeping in a train corridor is very different from sleeping in a regular bed. The movement of the train rocks you to sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree way of traveling is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be forgotten along with your paperback book and socks. All you need is one of those tickets in your hand.

A ticket that lets young people travel through many countries in one day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize how much we could do with this ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling non-stop was too exciting. There was always one more country to visit, and it didn’t cost us anything extra.

We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We planned our own schedule and focused only on the sights we could easily see. This was a chance to avoid guided tours and do something different. I was proud that in many places, all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like most other Inter-Railers who shared the train corridors, food, water, money, and music with us.

The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles can you really understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not let you discover new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is large, and Inter-Rail gives people a great chance to explore it, even if it doesn’t happen right away for everyone."
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck wearing clothes that are not suitable for the weather. 

Airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, but it is common for travelers to be separated from their luggage at some point. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it is impossible for any airline to guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially if your journey includes one or more flight changes.

Here is how the system works: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which gives enough time for luggage to go through the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to transfer between two flights, and these times are also extended to help with luggage transfers. Normally, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause flight delays, which can lead to issues with the baggage system. 

Human error can also happen, such as when a destination label gets torn off. These problems can be worse at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to transfer between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights).

Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The chance of losing luggage when changing planes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when transatlantic passengers connect to flights in Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers.

If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a calm atmosphere like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, almost like a flash of light, and it is gone in an instant. However, its image stays in your mind, and its beauty is surprising for such a small bird.

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He feels a strong connection to this little bird, but he cannot explain exactly why. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a bird that was once a moon goddess. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this story. Even though kingfishers have many shades of blue in their feathers, they do not have any blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. Their beautiful colors and the fact that they can be watched from a distance make them fascinating. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just one meter away. However, it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream where kingfishers lived. Unfortunately, school took away some of his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But his passion for this widespread kingfisher, which is the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant to the editor and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, Charlie wants to make the perfect kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than what his work can show."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from New Conductors**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant and was later asked to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I have always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after trying twice before. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and a role as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being known only for the competition: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried."" Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. If this doesn't happen, his career could suffer.

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says, ""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me."" He began as a musician in an opera house and worked with talented conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's *Agrippina* from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to achieve that. People respect my skills as a musician. I learn from every experience I've had, both in musical style and performance. Now, I will do whatever people ask to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall quickly found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to manage some relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best result. Many orchestral musicians I’ve seen don’t seem to need advice from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express what I want. If people see you’re worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are thinking about taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try out some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and nicer scenery. But the staff were very helpful, and we found it clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The park is beautifully designed, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There is something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still felt there was more to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is also a lot of fun for younger children. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they found out they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides isn’t boring. It is very clean, and the staff are great. When I couldn’t sit with both girls on one ride, a staff member kindly went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit of a coward, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it a little boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we definitely felt that way. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is the main attraction, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even worse! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older kids went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine moved from London to the countryside when her children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Since she had experience with computers, her husband suggested she start a design business. It was hard at first and required a lot of money. Christine was careful with her spending and kept the bank manager informed. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if she wants. Her business is small, and most customers come to pick up their work.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after getting married, she moved to the countryside where such jobs were not available. So, she started her own business and now makes 50 different greetings cards that she sells to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. Maggy does not advertise; her business grows through word of mouth. She is cheaper than other artists, which helps her get work from London. Although she misses sharing ideas with others, she finds more benefits than drawbacks in her situation.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing. In two years, her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000, and she employed six full-time workers. However, due to a decline in the economy, she had to let them go, which was difficult because jobs are hard to find in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. Delia has learned to lower her prices when needed and to look for new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the area. Tessa enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she often takes calls at unusual hours. The challenge is staying disciplined and closing the office door when needed. She publishes children's books from different cultures and collaborates with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because all her professional experience was in London.

E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home. Interested in health, she began making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. Requests from friends and family led her to send cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, and now she has a baker and an assistant. Meg no longer bakes herself; she focuses on managing the business. Her biggest challenge has been the financial side, as she did not have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their dad makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, but found it too expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years. 

After trying to make violins and violas, John finally made his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers that it turned out really well. John made another cello for him later, which Paul used until a few months ago. John has now retired from teaching and works full-time as a craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. He was very proud to sell one to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul began with the piano: ""As soon as I could reach the keys, I played,"" he recalls. He also tried the violin because his dad played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. However, Paul preferred the cello after being inspired by a cellist in his dad's group. 

Huw, now 22, says their parents were supportive but not pushy. He felt encouraged by Paul's success rather than threatened by it. Huw is now starting to make a name for himself as a pianist and composer.

Paul has achieved a lot with the cello his dad made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. He played his father's cello until last year, but now he has a new cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 

Paul jokes that his dad's cello might need 50 to 100 years to sound as powerful as his new one, which is already 304 years old. Soon, Paul will perform on television with his new cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. However, he won't be able to watch himself because he will be playing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. ""You are always dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies,"" he explains. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. 

Gareth says, ""It helps that I still farm with my parents. I can understand farmers and their problems. They can't trick me!"" His farming background also helps him handle the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was younger. He now realizes that farming has changed the countryside. ""It's not the farmers' fault; they were just following government advice,"" he says.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. Both sides wanted things done their own way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. ""We are at a point where we can bring them together,"" Gareth explains. 

Gareth's work includes conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. ""My job is to make sure tasks are completed efficiently and without problems. I enjoy seeing projects finished, but I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork,"" he shares. 

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys every moment, especially talking to the public. However, he finds some visitors frustrating. ""Some people come in, demand everything, and leave as if they own the place. It annoys me to be nice to them!"" he admits. But Gareth believes that common sense is key.

If you have common sense and enjoy outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. However, don't expect a job to open up in the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, which is normal for her as she prepares for the World Championships next month. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket parking lot. 

I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on what I'm doing—my movements and my feet—that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slowing down out of the corner of my eye, but that’s it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships. I have a strict schedule to get fit."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra knows the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose. But once the game is over, we become friends again.""

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It’s important that we all think and train like world-class players. As captain, I need to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my team.""

Kendra explained, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned everything carefully. I decided a while ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents help a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be difficult to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents may not realize their child's needs until they show frustration through difficult behavior. While most schools can help children who excel in academic subjects, musically talented children need special support that may not be available in regular schools, especially if music is not a priority there. 

Children who are musically gifted, or whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established recently. These schools provide a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend about one third to one half of their day on music activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their first and second instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program that focuses on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. However, students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with small class sizes and a high number of teachers compared to students. Most children at these schools live there full-time, which allows them to spend their formative years with others who share their interests and goals.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; fees for boarding students range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, each school tries to help parents of talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They emphasize that their goal is to help children become well-rounded individuals.

It is clear that separating musically gifted children from a young age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, all specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help when needed. 

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic program, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met. 

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before considering a specialist music education. Children who are also academically gifted may do well in a regular school with a strong music program or by combining a normal school schedule with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, as well as opportunities to play in orchestras and chamber music groups. However, this option may not be possible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path that goes from east to west are full of colors, shapes, and structures. This beauty is partly because of the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the way flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they keep changing.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked like fake ones sold in some shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects to paint, she has found it hard to spend time in the garden recently. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. This is her second year as a chalet girl. Sarah, 24, is from West Sussex and works in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University, where she studied French and History of Art. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. ""They get a full breakfast - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.""

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because she says it would be a mistake. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks are not as good for various reasons.""

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, Sarah does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""when you really don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired.""

On Sundays, Sarah starts work earlier than usual because breakfast for the guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. ""We just clean everything - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get ready for the next guests."" If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. ""Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions. I think the mountain air affects them.""

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_12,"**Changing Lives with a Stranger**

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper who spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. She found it hard to choose what to wear because she usually wears a uniform at the zoo. Her day started in a photo studio and then she went to press previews before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and she felt rushed at the magazine when she could have been quietly cuddling an animal. Some people on the fashion team seemed stressed, but Mandie’s job is not very stressful. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, she laughed at the thought that she would normally be cleaning cages or handling rats. She is interested in how magazines work, but she loves her job at the zoo and wants to stay there.

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. She arrived wearing leather boots and dark blue trousers, but the zoo gave her a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because she got very dirty. While petting an elephant, she thought about Mandie probably packing clothes at the magazine. By five o'clock, she felt dirty but had a wonderful day. She could see herself working with elephants in Africa after she retires from fashion.

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the team from the gardening show Ground Force. She was very excited to meet the team, especially Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter. She enjoyed being outside because she sometimes doesn’t see daylight due to her shifts. Although the work was hard, it was fun. She thought she was strong, but felt weak compared to the team. She realized that landscape gardening involved a lot of physical work and planning. She is more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so she doesn’t plan to leave her nursing job.

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener from Ground Force, spent a day at Hammersmith Hospital. He made beds and handed out medicine. He thought he might faint during some tasks, but he was surprised that it didn’t bother him. He enjoyed the friendship among the nurses and felt it was very different from his usual male work environment. He felt that his job was not as important as nursing. Although his day at the hospital was not easy, it gave him a great sense of satisfaction.

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, worked with Ryanair as cabin crew for a day. When she put on the uniform, she felt different and noticed that people looked up to her. Before the flight, their supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which she already knew from her fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, she handed out magazines and felt self-conscious as everyone stared at her. On the way back, they had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn’t sit still, and she wished she was back in the gym with one sensible adult.

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. She was nervous about this swap because she doesn’t exercise. She was surprised by how much attention trainers give to one person. In her job, she meets 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, she noticed that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. She wouldn’t change her job for this, but it inspired her to join a gym and try to be healthier."

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past some of the most beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning views.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and was sent to stay with an aunt. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am very grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was wonderful as we traveled through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but that’s not true for me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old train line that volunteers had kept in good condition. That’s where my love for steam trains started. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"**Trying to Get Published?**

If you want to publish your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Where should I send it?"" One of the first things you need to do is research the market and learn about publishers while also improving your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world.

No matter what type of writing you do, you should learn about the markets you want to reach. The best way to do this is by reading as much as you can about relevant topics. Visit your local library, bookstores, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

As time goes on, you need to keep updating your knowledge because new publications are always coming out. Editors change jobs, and magazines can change their focus. Publishers are always looking for new writers, so you need to know what they want.

At first, you might not be sure what you want to write. For example, if you think you want to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories. This market is quite limited these days, so get as many recent copies of those magazines as you can. Learn about the types of stories they buy and who their readers are. These readers have specific expectations, and the editor wants to meet those needs.

Writers often ask me, ""This story has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I never want to discourage anyone. However, it is likely that the work is not ready for publication. I try to give honest feedback while staying positive. The problem is that many new writers are too eager to send out their work before they are ready. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. This almost never happens. When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been in publishing or journalism for several years before achieving it.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, start writing more stories while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. This will help you become more confident and fluent in your writing. Instead of giving up on your stories, work on improving them. 

I also recommend not showing your work to others, especially in the beginning. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before finding success. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby, or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."
FCE_4,"**No Title**

On the last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I expected. The usual clean and bright feeling of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had their bags all over the floor. 

A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought it would be nice to talk to her. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

""Well, I'm going north,"" she replied, ""but to Philadelphia? No, I'm going to New York."" 

""Thanks, anyway,"" he said and moved to the next bench. Now I was really paying attention. 

""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said she was going to Wilmington, he just walked on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform as if I was focused on the train. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me, but I understood why he didn’t. He probably thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. 

By now, he looked very stressed. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five, older than me. She looked like a school teacher. 

""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 

They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them like pets. Then I heard the man talking. 

""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do."" 

The woman nodded sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet and waited to see where this was going. 

""So I told her to stay put in the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" 

That sounded suspicious! Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? 

""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" 

That seemed like a weak excuse to me. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one, the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Be careful, lady, I thought silently."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes that everyone gets a chance in life. His chance was to run a restaurant, and Gary's chance was to cook.

When John first saw the restaurant, it was in very bad condition, but he thought it was perfect for his plans. This experience reminded him of his childhood. He remembers being sad when his mother went to work in a factory and he was left alone. Because of this, he wanted to make sure his family had time together. His wife took care of the children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made time for family meals. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become very confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.

Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into the corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he had a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and would wake up even before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John was happy to see Gary working.

Although Gary was not very good in school, he was excellent in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would work in catering because he had a natural talent. When Gary needed to do work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told Gary that he needed to achieve his goals by the age of 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped all his vegetables and sliced the meats. He even helped his classmates. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that if you want something, you have to work hard for it because nothing is given for free. Gary has recognized the opportunities he has and has taken full advantage of them.

As parents, we talk to our children as they grow up, and even if they only remember a little of what we say, we should be happy. John sees that Gary listens and learns from him, which makes him proud."
FCE_7,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult. The best way to find one is through personal connections. If you know someone who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have those connections. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. For her, Dublin felt very unfamiliar. She felt nervous when she took the train to start her new job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave her small town. They all wanted to escape and experience life. Some of her classmates had moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm because they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn’t know they were still talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her job at the post office and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.

There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. 

""Desperate place,"" she told Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt."" 

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up. 

""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, looked like a punk. Jo had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 

""I'm Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. 

Nessa said they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs: one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" 

""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of dolphin populations.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with dreams of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been supported by TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today.

The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected by laws and cared for in special marine areas. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a major wildlife disaster.

There are forty different types of dolphins around the world. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are seen in small groups. We know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen often near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were once found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, including the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, like skin injuries.

It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is a major problem, as it reduces fish populations and threatens local fishing industries. Porpoises and dolphins need to find food quickly. If fish are removed from one area, they may not have enough time to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died after being caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also store harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in their fat. Female dolphins produce milk that contains these poisons, which can harm their young. There has been at least one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which can disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might be tired of reading about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.

Exercise helps improve your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries. You can see quick improvements in areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Additionally, exercise is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits many times, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can help you sleep better. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If you’re not convinced yet, just remember that common sense tells us exercise is good for us. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. If you’re unsure about what exercises are right for you, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. If you have poor posture, it can make you look and feel less energetic and can lead to health problems. To improve your posture, imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head up towards the sky. This will help you lift your chest and breathe better, while also making your body look slimmer.

Stretching your muscles is important because it improves flexibility and helps you move easily. It also helps you maintain good posture and prevents injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, and you should do it slowly and carefully.

The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their comfortable homes for months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it can be very hard to find them. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost constant rain. This has caused many unexpected problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their teamwork has produced some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a popular film about leopards. While that film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.

Traveling film-makers have been exploring the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we usually get over them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they both understand the animals in a similar way. 

""When we are moving, we have to set up our tents each night. But now we are working from a fixed camp. We leave at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that they heat and serve. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can sometimes be stressful,"" Newman said. 

Their life can be tough, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would often go off alone, but when she returned, she would greet all the other lions and eventually come to greet their car too.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in one location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. 

Newman said, ""Amanda and I built a good working relationship from the start because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is much better than just making them think."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, which was normal for her as she prepared for the World Championships next month. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to learn about her training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus so much on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships. I follow a strict schedule to be as fit as possible."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but she knows they will be a tough team to play. ""They have a lot of talent,"" she said. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years Kendra has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive now. ""You don’t train hard to lose,"" Kendra said. ""But after the final whistle, we become friends again.""

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. ""It’s important that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explained. As captain, she believes it’s essential to have a strong mindset and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes, knowing her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, Rachel says, ""The space is so small that I can touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

""If there is a problem and we need to get to the top quickly, we can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but I don’t think it would be a pleasant journey.""

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space.

Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. ""We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There is a large area of underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. This is where the Atlantic Ocean is very active. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""

When she is not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

""The only time I was scared was during my first dive with the Americans. We were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we were so relieved - we were still alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel amazed. I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D., and when I finally saw them in person, it was an incredible feeling."""
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone of voice, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believes it is important to be on time. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that candidates who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People often say that what matters is inside, but in an interview, you should try to present yourself in the best way possible. However, many people overlook the importance of a professional appearance.

For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Body language and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% comes from our voice, and a surprising 55% comes from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview. She was offered the job immediately. However, she reacted with too much excitement. Once her boss saw how happy she was, he knew she would accept the offer, so he gave her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated for a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can affect the success of an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can provide information about the company’s activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can show your interest in the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and highlight important points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer exciting. It became very tiring, and no one was having fun anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel that has one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and I’m still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He says, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very helpful. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent. It was a big change for us. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky that our friendships have lasted, and many of them come to visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were terrible. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. Since I work in fashion, I have to keep up with collections and trends, so there is always a lot to do. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one who gets the blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He says, ""I worked in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work satisfying. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I decided to resign and travel for a year. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life. That is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports**

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s fun there because the facilities are great and the nightlife is exciting. However, I have to be very disciplined. If my friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn. To succeed, I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I do enjoy sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it is worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a big win, I always celebrate, and if I win money, I like to go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship allowed me to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I am a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my teammates, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and always celebrate our wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childish when we celebrate, but we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than in our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to come back and hang out with friends who do different things. You can’t focus on the sport all the time; it’s not healthy. I am known in the sailing world, but I am rarely recognized in public. I wouldn’t want to be a celebrity. I do receive nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is part of why we broke up. It was difficult, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. I try not to let it bother me too much. I want to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and when I give in to their requests, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make their own choices. It’s a tough situation.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a key place for this advertising to work. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about how bad sugar is for their teeth are not convincing when compared to the fun and emotional ads they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. However, Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to convince people to buy products. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests. ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they are sometimes inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less when their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for any lost sales."
FCE_20,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin has been created after a lot of research into what customers want and nearly two years of work to convert four large 18th-century houses. This approach has allowed the hotel to use the latest technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses the hotel’s computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special services for returning guests, which is important for a five-star hotel. Although the system cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He appreciates its efficiency and the services it offers. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will find the technology in their rooms especially useful. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has brought traditional business center services into the guest rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, so they can easily replace them with newer models. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed. Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann says they have worked hard to make sure guests do not feel overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are spacious, well-furnished, comfortable, and welcoming.

The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who already had two Michelin stars for his Dublin restaurant, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move has allowed him to design a new kitchen and improve the restaurant. The hotel also offers better parking than his previous location. For the hotel, having a successful restaurant brings many benefits without financial risks.

With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need to be challenged and learn new things. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing, which is very energizing. If I'm bored, I feel drained. Doing something meaningful, even in a small way, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a burden. I need enough sleep to feel good. When I only get six hours, I feel tired. Exercise helps me feel energized, but I have to find the motivation to do it! I take a yoga class once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't eat perfectly for energy; I think my enthusiasm and positive attitude help. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many lively young people, which energizes me. I enjoy taking photos and writing lyrics for fun, which helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in being positive about life. I enjoy working with kids because they are full of energy. Smiling at others can create a positive feeling. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""I love creating gardens from empty spaces. I once turned a concrete area into a garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also gives me energy. I enjoy exploring nature, even if it means sneaking onto private land.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""It's important to have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don't enjoy drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found them exhausting. You have limited energy, so focus on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron skates appeared in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the wealthy people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie showed a more athletic style, making skating very popular.

Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are very important, and you can only go faster as you get better. Your body position is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. 

Relaxation is crucial in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot while making a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you practice this for a while, you can gradually make bigger movements as you improve. 

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed to reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel and then stand up. 

Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. It’s best to start with figure skating and then learn basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn the basic moves, and soon you can practice turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed and smooth their movements are. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise program. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens your body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates a great fitness program for overall health."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can bring tears of joy. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges of their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder, 15**  
Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Right now, the training is very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it day by day. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes your body stiff.""

B. **Annika's Mother**  
""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen some parents push their children, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika’s level takes a lot of time and energy, so she has to want it herself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""

C. **Sarah Stokes, 14**  
Sarah started show-jumping at age 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents love show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement of show-jumping. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I am determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team, and my big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's Mother**  
""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she had found her passion. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living area of our horse box. Sarah is very organized and is happiest when she is on a horse. Watching her succeed at something she loves is amazing.""

E. **Jane McShane, 10**  
Jane is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about being arrogant; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's Mother**  
""Jane played her first chess game at age 5. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it right away. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. I’m happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is talented. If she has this gift, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are starting to lose the effects of many years of poor diet, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are beginning to reach our true potential. We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Most of the world's green areas have been taken over by farms, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories people eat today. This limited diet has harmed human health and growth. 

Over the years, we have mostly eaten soups, porridges, and breads, which have left us underfed and not fully developed. In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly and underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Some anthropologists say corn was not a blessing but a health disaster. 

Despite this, farming spread because one piece of land could support ten times more people than hunting could. The problem of poor nutrition has only recently been addressed, even in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing companies are constantly changing their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. There must be a limit. According to Robert Fogel from the University, this limit could be around 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. 

However, scientists have a warning. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. Since the climate has warmed, we seem to have become thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. As the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""

Many believe that studio audiences are the least important type of audience. Some people in television even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I thought studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract various types of people for different programs.

People who prefer to watch television at home often wonder why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit through hours of boredom just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on television for a moment. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason is that people are curious to see how things work behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you do what the signs say. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte liked feeling involved with live television. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors; I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For most people in the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,"**Favorite Places**

**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes that are untouched by people. I find the human element important. This is also true when I travel abroad. I am attracted to beautiful villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape from school. I loved exploring the bare hilltops, the sheltered valleys, and the old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn’t cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey that I always look forward to - when our small train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers get to see people in their homes, making tea, washing dishes, or setting up a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people’s lives. It’s the ordinary landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me look more closely and search for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and full of rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to enjoy the beauty of the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there and not many visitors either. It’s a quiet and remote area, and I love the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is the place of my dreams. It is a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, the wind, and the birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals of all kinds. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank ready for animals like this, so we could admire it and look it up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling some water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, the white mouse I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the kids who were waving their arms.

In the chaos, I tripped and fell. As I thought about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat were jumping around, making a lot of noise. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over.

I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and pulled the wet, unharmed mouse from his mouth. Interestingly, that same mouse was caught by Domino three more times in its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged, I looked at the snake to find a way to catch it, but it seemed impossible. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, hoping to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, but it still looked suspicious.

Carefully, I slid my hands under the snake and stood up. I walked to the end of the garden and pointed the snake towards a tree, giving it a chance to live freely. When I finally let go of its head, I expected it to attack me, but instead, it wrapped around my shoulders like a colorful shawl, as if it wanted to stay with me.

As the sun began to set, my four children, the snake, and I stood together. My oldest son, DJ, broke the silence and said, ""Mum, you’re nice and warm, and the shed isn’t."" I asked the kids to help encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"**Drop Me a Line!**

In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by any other way of communicating. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who it is from, and pleasure in reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back to me. Sometimes my father wrote, and I loved receiving his long, funny letters. Most of the letters from home shared everyday news about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch through letters. Instead of hurting our relationships, writing letters seemed to make them stronger. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than by talking.

I enjoy the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a whole year’s worth of news! I especially love receiving letters in airmail envelopes with beautiful stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There’s also a lady in France who writes to me. If we hadn’t talked in a restaurant on the way home from a holiday, I would never have been able to write to her. Luckily, she replied, and now we have a regular correspondence. I can practice my French with her since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited her twice, and she has stayed with us.

My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our friendship lasted so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it on the front page!

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not survive for future generations. The mountain is believed to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include images of cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer,"" he explains. ""The drawings are already polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look newer.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, the director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees with this idea. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is very strict, and while it may be effective, it will likely upset local residents."" He adds that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect it.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't perfect. Our department believes the best solution is to let people visit the site, but it is hard to stop them from causing damage because the area is so large. I would prefer that everyone could see it, but the main problem is money. We do not have enough funds to hire enough guards. We may need to think about charging an entrance fee, as there seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—since tourists can now avoid a long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to close off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't happen because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and when I give in to their requests, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make their own choices. I just can’t win.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a key place for this advertising to work. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about how bad sugar is for their teeth are not convincing when compared to the fun and emotional ads they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. However, Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to convince people to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests. ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they are sometimes inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we are buying double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It also depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less when their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract enough extra customers to make up for it."
FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

In the past, climbers went to the mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. A crowd watches in excitement as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall. The ability to have these events is thanks to new and quickly developing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid getting bored.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls using special bricks that climbers could hold onto. One of the first climbing walls was built by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Many similar climbing walls were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had some problems. These walls could only be straight up and down, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French manufacturers also started to make climbing panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for making overhanging walls without a lot of construction, but steel frames could be built anywhere. This system of interchangeable holds gave climbers many new options to try."
FCE_61,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**

If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably mention that it is a risky career. Acting is indeed risky because there are many more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some of your closest friends might think you are making a bad choice, while others may support you. Everyone will have different opinions, but this is a personal decision, and you are responsible for your own choices and dreams.

There are no easy paths to becoming an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee that you will succeed in the profession. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors and fresh talent, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes good rewards.

Many people ask what talent really is. I think talent is a combination of natural skill and imagination, which is hard to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. 

Where does the desire to act come from? It can be hard to explain why you want to act. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform.

If you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they might not have a clear answer. They understand their own skills and techniques, but they know that their success can change quickly. Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role, but even if you want the job badly, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid talking about their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. No one likes to be rejected, and this fear is present from the moment you start auditioning professionally. You are saying that you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. Ultimately, if you don’t care enough about your acting career, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are starting to lose the effects of many years of poor diet, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are beginning to reach our true potential. We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories people eat today. This limited diet has harmed human health. 

Over the years, we have mostly eaten soups, porridges, and breads, which have left us underfed and not fully developed. In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Some anthropologists say corn was not a blessing but a health disaster. 

However, farming spread because one piece of land could support ten times more people than hunting could. Many people relying on farming are still poorly nourished, but this issue is only recently being addressed, even in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. Although people are getting taller, the standard bed length has stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Also, legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing companies are constantly changing their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

Experts believe there might be a limit to our height, possibly around 193 cm, which we could reach this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by global warming."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer exciting. It became very tiring, and no one was having fun anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, not much has changed for me: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He says, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very helpful. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are grown, so we didn’t need to support them anymore. It was a big change for us. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky that our friendships have lasted, and many of them come to visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were terrible. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even longer hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. In the fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He says, ""I was in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work satisfying. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year instead. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life. That is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Onto a Winner**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and enjoying their childhood memories. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played the game and, as Dave says, ""had the best time ever."" 

Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico, but they did not forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he made from old wooden crates. They continued to play regularly. When visitors came over, they were often curious because the game was unknown in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed that their old pichenotte board was cracked and decided to make a new one. The new board was beautiful. A relative saw it and wanted one, and then a friend wanted another. 

To see how much interest there was, one night the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But then they sat down, and soon they couldn't get up from the table!"" When people asked about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found that the game likely started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game was adapted into 'squails' in British pubs, and British people brought it to Canada a century ago. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks.' They flick the pucks across a round board using their middle or index finger. Getting a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

When the brothers saw how popular the game was at the bar, they made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Soon, championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start a pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and began making boards. So far, they have produced more than 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12 kg, and is 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable because they need to handle a lot of use."" 

The boards are available for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers believe that one day their garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this was a piece of waste land, flat and covered with brambles. For many years, it was seen as useless land. However, with careful planning and hard work from one man, supported by his wife, this area has been transformed into the beautiful place you see today.

During the construction of the village, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. Although machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of hard work was also done by hand. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. 

In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants were carefully chosen to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by hand over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to resist all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how to choose materials that would last. Soon, he became an expert himself.

You will notice that all the models are built to the same scale and that great care has been taken with even the smallest details. This was achieved through patience and special building techniques. The Model Village has become a very popular attraction, known for its high quality and maintenance. The methods used to create these realistic models have been used in other model villages in England and even taught in some college courses.

All the buildings in the village show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can take a long time to repair. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations, as we are constantly updating them.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don’t forget to tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. While some pop stars do pose for paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle such problems. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel—a place where people expect privacy—she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation on its own. It should also look into a recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on this and other unacceptable stories?

At first, this seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and shown on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide behind trees waiting to take pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" it would face several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an investigation? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still did not want to act, should the PCC proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and they could be upset if it wasn’t. 

The role of the PCC is very big. How could it realistically monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy has been violated, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Many people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. They could be hiding a worse story from the press and fear that it would come out if they complain. In this way, the PCC might even become an enemy. 

One British comedian faced problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he complain later when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Many college graduates receive advice when starting their first job. This article focuses on what to consider when moving to a second job. We are not talking about those who are looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those who leave a job they don’t like after a few weeks. Instead, we will discuss how to take a real step in your career. Now that you have some experience and skills, you need to think about what kind of job you want next.

Your choice of job should depend on your long-term goals. Ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher responsibilities, or explore a wider field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully, as you should plan to stay in it for two to three years. Future employers will look closely at this job when you apply for your next position. It should show that you are serious about your career and that it helps you grow and take on more responsibilities.

If you feel the urge to travel, this might be a good time to do so. You can work temporarily when you return and then find your second job. Employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are ready to settle down.

FCE_17,"**Text: 'What is the Secret of Confident People?'**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but most will say it is a skill they learned because they needed to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was nervous, but I did well, and someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school changed my life and helped me in many other areas.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive at first. I thought that was what being confident meant, but I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel unconfident, so I often talk to myself to push those fears away.

**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but the calmer I seem, the more scared I actually am. I had to learn to look confident because it is very important in TV. Interviewing people has shown me that many of us feel nervous in important situations, but we feel better when we talk to someone friendly. The best advice I got was from my mother when I was worried about my clothes as a teenager. She said, ""Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves."" I remember this often. I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked in the restaurant, but not everyone will like you. You have to accept yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers many training courses, which have helped my self-esteem. They also encourage us to set realistic goals. It is helpful to see that you are achieving something instead of trying to do everything at once and ending up with nothing.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up, even when I disagreed. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I first worked in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, ""Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too."" I also found it helpful to write down a few notes to refer to, like a comfort blanket! I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional - if the line breaks, finders keep it... and anyway, I have plenty more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All of them were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat down in the shade of the whispering trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and looked out at Malaysia's biggest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a line of nervous competitors held the lines of their kites, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each competitor had entered four different designs, which would be judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying ability. 

""Flying kites isn't so difficult,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how it's done."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he asked me to come back the next day to start rebuilding his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started, it would have been good to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and a few bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many living things moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a fantastic view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the big drops. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 

No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their questions were friendly. Kelantan might be famous for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of its people."

I don’t often buy things for myself, and when I do, I feel guilty and don’t tell my husband how much I spent.""

C. **Juliet, 28, Personnel Manager**  
""I only shop for what I really need. I dislike shopping and only go when I have to. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and I won’t settle for anything else. Shopping is tiring for me, and I would rather be doing something else.""

D. **Anita, 35, TV Producer**  
""I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to get in and out quickly. However, I do have some clothes in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m careful but sometimes make mistakes.""

E. **Lizzie, 41, Secretary**  
""I really don’t enjoy shopping. I dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or get help. The shops are too noisy and messy, which makes it a nightmare for me. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often because I usually get them as gifts. For food, I go to the supermarket once a week and do it quickly.""

F. **Lisa, 22, Actress**  
""I’m probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my friends to look around the shops, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have something specific in mind, but if I see something I like, I’ll buy it.""

G. **Suki, 26, Art Gallery Assistant**  
""I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy a lot. I usually know what I want and don’t go overboard. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often regret spending too much.""

H. **Ann-Marie, 29, Nursery Worker**  
""I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I consider myself a careful shopper. I have a good idea of what I want and I don’t rush into buying things. I like to check other shops to find better deals, which takes me a long time.""

I. **Linda, 32, Restaurant Manager**  
""I don’t like shopping much, maybe because I work in the city center and the shops don’t excite me anymore. When I have to shop, I go but don’t try things on because it’s too much trouble.

Children will be guided to 14 surprising paintings and will answer different questions about them. The quiz sheets will be available from March 25 to April 9 during normal gallery hours.

**New Picture**  
The Gallery now has a beautiful still life painting by the Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for certain flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was kindly given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on March 15. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this period: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until May 31.

**Lecture News**  
A series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On April 5, Lizzie Barker will talk about Melendez's work. On April 12, Sarah Symmons will discuss Luis Paret. On April 19 and 26, Juliet Wilson will speak about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often tell a story through their pictures.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery is happy to announce that the restaurant has improved and expanded its services. With new kitchens, the restaurant now offers a wide variety of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Information for Visitors**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery are available every day at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (except Sundays). These tours introduce some of the Gallery's greatest paintings and showcase a wide range of important European art from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."
PET_24,"**Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where kids can have fun and learn to make good food.

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. At first, I was happy staying at home and wasn't very interested. But now, I'm really glad I decided to come.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to make food for themselves when they leave home."""

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are types of money, similar to how a gram or a kilometer are units of measurement. The main difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for honey from Mr. Hive. This was a simple exchange between two people, each with something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of money, called 'currencies', to make trading easier. Eventually, different currencies started to connect, which is why today we all use a national currency."
PET_46,"**Write a Winning Story!**

You could win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky winners will receive a cheque for £100. We are looking for people who can write good stories. The judges include Mary Littlejohn, a novelist, Michael Brown, a television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything you like, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, many stories were about love, family, and problems with friends. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so that people want to read them. Write about everyday things in a new and surprising way.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your descriptions are accurate. If you write about a town or how a jet engine works, be sure you have the correct information. Only write about things you are sure about.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A bad ending can ruin a good story. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the ending.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using good words to describe them. 

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country. This is a new rule based on popular request. Your story must not have been published in any form, such as on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.

You need to pay a fee of £5 to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to us. The closing date is 30 July, and we will inform the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist known in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare because most women at that time had few chances to study.

After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She quickly became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. Although we do not have her books, we know she wrote several important works on mathematics. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to assist her work.

During her time, many rulers were afraid of science, and people involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. Grass is the only type of flowering plant that can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way.

Grass can recover quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil instead of from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing fresh food for them."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion. She recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.

After finishing university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to many industry events but could not afford the designer clothes she liked. To solve this, she started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. 

Kal then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes became very popular, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. 

Kal's parents were supportive of her decision to change careers, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels grateful for her journey and says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

The hotel is located on a main road that leads to the town center. It is about a 20-minute bus ride from the center of town, and many buses stop outside the hotel. Guests should avoid buses with a blue ""Express"" sign, as they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 comfortable, centrally-heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are located at the end of the corridors. The hotel also has a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are eight pianos available for guests to use. There is parking space for cars in the hotel driveway. Daily newspapers are provided for free, and guests can buy stamps at the office.

Guests who stay for a long time must pay for their rooms weekly in advance and give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests are given priority for rooms.

Meal times are as follows: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. For those studying or working late, dinner can be requested until 11 pm by writing your name on the late list or by calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices available for breakfast and dinner.

If you have tapes or CDs, please keep the noise down, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. Guests are advised to take a taxi to the hotel if they arrive by train, as we are a bit far from the main railway station."

Tom Cruise is one of the most successful actors in movie history. However, his life has not always been easy. As a young boy, Tom was shy and found it hard to make friends, but he loved acting in school plays. After finishing high school, Tom moved to New York to find work. He got a job as a porter and also took drama classes. In 1980, the film director Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. Ten years later, he became very successful and was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, earning millions of dollars for each film. Today, Tom still acts in movies and remains very popular with his many fans around the world."

The driver found her after he had driven over 500 kilometers. It was the end of a long day, and both the driver and Bo were hungry. He gave her some milk and started to ask questions. He called his last customers, but they had not lost a cat. Since it was getting late, he took Bo home for the night and the next morning, he took her to an animal hospital. Bo's owner was also looking for her. After searching everywhere, he remembered the furniture van that had delivered to a neighbor. Luckily, he remembered the name of the company. He called their office, and soon Bo was safely returned to him.'"
PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway took a train journey from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train travels across Australia, from the warm northern coast through vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late.

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s, with a line built from Adelaide to Alice Springs. However, heavy flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just a few months before my trip. The railway was designed for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is very good.

Originally, the railway was built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to southern Australia through Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent. It is rare to complete a transcontinental railway, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south railway.

As I waited to board the Ghan, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian retirees, and they were eager to get on the train. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip in the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop their journey there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But on the third day, at dawn, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was ending, and even though the train did not meet all the promises made in advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high, probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the ""Carries,"" which are large bowls cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes on Ben Nevis because the snow can be very hard, making it feel like walking on ice. 

Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.

The path quickly became steep, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest member of the group, so I had to take more breaks. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. Unfortunately, we were not lucky that day because a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we took turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top!"
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood to build it, just like our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The school took many months to build, and we watched the process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but it also meant that some nice open space was lost. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms that are very big—much bigger than the old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and large changing rooms that we can't wait to use when our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from everyone inside—the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders put it there after finishing the roof because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for the lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that you can see it from far away! We took some pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being finished. For example, we are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

PET_2,"**No Title**

A month ago, I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now, as I looked down at the river far below me, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place where we stayed was not great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we were not sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing. We switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally got out—covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."
PET_23,"**Letter to the Newport Evening News**

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I didn’t know what to do. I am 72 years old, far from home, and I felt very worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what had happened. He kindly gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He told me they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me.

I was amazed to get my handbag back with everything inside still there. I want to thank everyone who helped me that day. I really appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"**Sharks**

Sharks are some of the most frightening animals in our oceans. They are very good at hunting underwater because they can see well and feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.

Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly ever sleep. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to study sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting creatures."

PET_53,"Joining the Kirov Ballet

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came up to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and then they started talking to me in English, so we could understand each other. 

Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I can understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mom stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home one night because I felt lonely. 

The classes in Russia are much harder than at my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This helps me feel confident that I can meet the school’s high standards. In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. 

Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy. 

Right now, we are getting ready for a new production, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very lucky to be here."
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice by themselves. By the end of the 1980s, people started to see the dark and cold winter as a good thing. 

In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous around the world.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from many countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December, and each week after that, a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully finished. Because the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the completion date can change depending on the weather.

In spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing like warm overalls, hats, and gloves as part of their stay. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks. They should choose shoes that are a bit larger than normal to fit the thick socks.

If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items along with your booking, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the shop. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer who was called to the shop said: ""The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The shop quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them. Another problem was that there was a long line of cars trying to get to the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the shop. This blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: ""I waited in line for three hours, and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice because it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without help. A year earlier, she had dived deeper but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the first woman to break a world record previously held by a man.

A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive from different depths. After some serious accidents involving other divers, some people say free-diving is too dangerous. However, Tanya believes that safety is the most important thing, followed by training. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya keeps the same training schedule no matter what she is preparing for. Two-thirds of her training is done in the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking to build her fitness.

When she practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive. It is important for her not to get tired, as this could ruin her preparation. When she is not training for an event, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects and films.

Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, where she loved swimming and exploring rock pools to see sea life. She says her life now feels like living her childhood dreams. Because she is well-known in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she talks about environmental issues. Looking to the future, Tanya, who is now in her thirties, plans to keep breaking her own world records. Since she started free-diving at twenty-five, she is eager to continue in the sport for many more years."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, many in the film industry thought cartoons were only for children. However, a few directors had original ideas that showed cartoons could be fun for both adults and children. 

Not every cartoon film was successful, though. For example, *The Black Cauldron* did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first role on television. 

""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. 

Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me to say they were planning to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised at first, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. 

Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends about the filming, but they found out and thought it was amazing. It was a wonderful experience, and I feel very lucky. 

After university, I definitely want to make acting my career. I am not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. 

When filming ended, I didn’t know what to do next. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I am going to Greece for the summer with friends."""
PET_8,"**No Title**

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, my main goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a fast-growing international company. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is in this book. I believe our company has valuable lessons about running a successful business while staying true to our beliefs.

This is not a typical business book, and it is not just about my life. The main message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with love, and it can help others. In both business and life, I want to have fun, feel like I am part of a family, and be excited by new experiences. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.

Now, this book shares my ideas with the world. I hope to show that there are no limits to our 'family' and to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."
PET_4,"**A Journey Along the Beautiful Douro River**

Jules Verne operates a 'hotel ship' on the Douro River in Portugal. The MV Lady Ivy May can accommodate 160 guests in double cabins, all with outside views and private bathrooms. On the ship, which has air-conditioning, you will find a sun deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop, and library.

**Itinerary**

**Day 1:** You will leave London Heathrow in the early evening and arrive in Oporto. A guide will meet you and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.

**Day 2:** After sightseeing in Oporto in the morning, you will return to the ship and sail to Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey takes four hours.

**Day 3:** You will continue up the river. In the early evening, the ship will stop at Peso da Regua, known for its port wine. At dinner, you can enjoy delicious local food and drink.

**Day 4:** After breakfast, you will travel by bus to the ancient town of Lamego. You will visit the cathedral, several churches, and a museum that used to be a palace. The museum has a great collection of paintings, tapestries, and sculptures. After the visit, you will return to the ship and sail to Tua.

**Day 5:** The Douro River becomes very narrow here. Depending on the river's depth, you may take a smaller boat to the Spanish border at Barca d'Alva. You will return to Tua by coach, enjoying the sights along the way.

**Day 6:** In the morning, you will drive to Sao Joao da Pesqueira for one of the best views in the Douro Valley. After lunch on the ship, you will take the Douro Valley railway for a scenic ride to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be waiting for you.

**Day 7:** You will visit Vila Real before returning to the ship for lunch. Then, you will sail down the river to Oporto and spend the night on board the Lady Ivy May.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with enough time for sightseeing and last-minute shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey.

In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey so much that they used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve athletic performance. However, honey is not just food; it can also help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"**Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it an important center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it received a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years, becoming wealthier and famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days in a year. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing number of students and its success as a commercial center (it is the largest center for insurance services outside London), Norwich now offers many entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and various arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's new attractions is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the middle of their city while builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with beautiful water features and many trees. The local people are happy that the old open market still exists in the city center, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, which lasts for nine days each year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to join the event at its new location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots communicate with each other using radios, and they all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This event is called ""balloon glows,"" and it is a great chance to take amazing photos. To see the glows, you should arrive just after dark or before 5:30 am. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, with some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, as well as popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it!

In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies that offer rides. Another option is to ride the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a great view of the festival.

There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloon flying. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler winds at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival. Wear several layers of thin clothing because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, don’t forget your camera. If you use film, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and night photos."
PET_51,"The Eden Project

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. More than 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid because of a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone soon."
PET_11,"Some people have said they do not like this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I don’t understand why. It is amazing to have 500 pages of original writing for just £6.99. Most of the book is fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable pieces by well-known writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have written mainly about food. I recommend you avoid reading Jane Harris's Those Nails right after eating, as it has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset you! 

The collection also features great work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are excerpts from novels that are still being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Additionally, there is a small amount of non-fiction, including a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and an extraordinary piece by Ursula Owen about her life. Overall, this is an exceptional collection, and I am excited to see what next year's edition will bring."
PET_14,"**The Best Age to Learn the Violin**

Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher, believes that the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. She says this is when children are discovering the world around them. Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she sometimes makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds.

When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children’s five-year-old friends. Margaret teaches her students in groups. Each group has about twelve students, and they have lessons for one hour every two weeks. In addition, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents are also required to attend the classes because it is important for them to be involved in their children's learning.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play music by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how well they can play and how well they can read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not meant to create great violinists. She often suggests that students who do very well should leave her class and learn the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to their previous CD, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has also joined the band as the new drummer.

From the first song on the CD, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is moving away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford has a chance to show how talented he is, hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded these songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets does not need to worry, as all the concerts will be rescheduled as soon as Rob recovers.)

On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create great music in different styles, from the slow songs we know to the dance tracks that make you want to move. However, I felt that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as good. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."
PET_36,"**San Francisco**

San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land, not by sea.

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The wealthiest people were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

Today, many tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the old prison there."
PET_6,"**SAMUEL PEPYS**

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting look at everyday life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys writes about important events of that time, such as diseases, an enemy navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his mistakes—like often falling asleep in church or looking at pretty girls. 

He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they made up, as well as his worries about her health. Besides reading, he enjoyed music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. Pepys was a busy man with many important jobs; he was a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work with the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not think much about whether shoes were comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but we also have shoes made from materials like silk, plastic, and cotton, depending on current fashion trends. 

It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. 

In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, while some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines helped the shoe industry produce many more shoes at lower prices, making them available to more people."
PET_20,"**No Title**

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women get into running, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to help them feel confident about it. So, I started a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with how some race organizers think. They often say there are not enough women in running, but they also use this as a reason not to provide separate changing rooms.

I put up posters, and 40 women of all ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don’t think they had thought much about running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn’t see it as a chance to chat and smile while running in beautiful places, like by a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about healthy eating and staying fit from other runners. I wanted to do something for women in running, and it has been a joy to see their progress—almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people came to Alaska hoping to get rich. New towns were built quickly, and one of these towns was called Iditarod, which means ""far, distant place."" In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

In the summer, supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it hard to reach them. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog teams pulling sleds. These teams delivered mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at ""roadhouses"" where the drivers could sleep and eat, along with their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams as the main way to transport goods. However, in 1925, the dogs became famous again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the closest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and no one was sure if they could fly in such cold weather. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away on a trip. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine instead.

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty dog teams completed the trip in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to find the way through the heavy snow, and Togo proved to be a great guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further and saved the team from falling into icy water. Thanks to their efforts, the diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""
PET_45,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite the cold, 6,000 tourists visit each year to see one of the most unique hotels in Europe. In this hotel, everything is made of ice, including the rooms where you eat, drink, and sleep. You can even have a wedding there! The bar is also made of ice, so it is not a good idea to put hot drinks on it.

The bedrooms are about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to keep warm in the cold. If needed, they can also get suitable outdoor clothing. The hotel lasts for only six months because it melts in the summer, and every winter, it is rebuilt. Building the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."
PET_29,"**Maria Mutola**

In 1988, Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized that she was very fast.

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" But Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful and that this could help their family. They agreed to let him take her away to train.

In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were amazing, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs, and for most of the year, she lives happily in South Africa with her mother."
PET_57,"**The Skywalk**

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and mostly to enjoy the view. The view is amazing, and it is even better because of the Skywalk. The Skywalk is 1,219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass, so you can see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. The Skywalk opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of people have visited it. You must wear special covers over your shoes to protect the glass. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air, like a bird."
PET_9,"**THE ROCKIES**

The Rocky Mountains stretch almost the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest and are only a few hundred miles from the center in the southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are still very beautiful. There are many roads that go through the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. 

You can start your journey from Vancouver, which is one of the most beautiful cities in Canada. This city is located by the water and near the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. 

In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you will see some of the best views at night."
PET_42,"**ZOOS**

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years. The first big zoo was called the Gardens of Intelligence, opened by the rulers of China. In the past, animals in zoos were trained to perform for visitors, but this is no longer done. Now, the main purpose of zoos is to let people see animals behaving naturally.

Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with zoos. Supporters believe that zoos help us learn about the natural world and allow us to see wild animals up close. They think these experiences would not be possible without zoos.

On the other hand, some people do not support zoos. They believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also argue that in poorly managed zoos, animals may live in dirty conditions and eat the wrong food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like my band to bright T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of our playing was amazing, especially since we are all so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but it was even better when my band played!  

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half of the students. However, anyone who is eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I have been to a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not challenging enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel connected to its history, as you play on stage like great jazz performers did before you. My school is very lucky because we have great teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we would not get far with our music!"

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain at any time between November and March. However, it does not rain often. When it does rain, the city's water pipes cannot handle the sudden floods, which can turn the streets into rivers. Many winters have been dry recently, so when it finally rains, the local people are very happy.

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain. Instead, they get water from a system of underground channels that were built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year round. Places that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases.

Further south of Marrakesh, travelers reach Skoura. In Skoura, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels, and people use these squares to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas mountains in winter create a beautiful background for this area."
PET_32,"**Gareth Ellis**

Gareth Ellis, who is 13 years old, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always wanted to be a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. 

""People laugh when we tell them,"" says Kath. ""But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found jobs with a famous circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and go home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away.

""I can't say it was easy,"" says Kath. ""There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving our nice house behind. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""

""People ask about my education,"" says Gareth, ""but from the beginning, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I use the same books as everyone back at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates.""

And what about the future? ""It was a difficult decision,"" says Kath, ""but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day,"" he says, ""maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to important national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet and work on projects together. We plan to open more centers in the future. Since we started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined us. Sophie is one of them. She says, ""I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age didn't matter; we were trusted to do stories on our own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share their skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who go with them on these trips.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. These flights take you over Antarctica and then back. The exact flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to a different date if needed.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is also a camera next to the pilot that shows you the view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an end-of-row seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' to give everyone a good view from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans approved. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the satellite images of the clouds and chooses the direction with the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all types of cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"**Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where kids can have fun and learn to make good food.

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to make food for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill, and ice can be hidden under melting snow, making it easy to lose control of your car. A car coming towards you might slide across the road unexpectedly.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick or rough movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. You can think of it like driving with a full cup of hot coffee next to you—drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to pay attention to what could happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you realize. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times that distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law but decided to go to art school instead. He found the traditional drawing classes hard, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art, and he became interested in early Italian artists. This influence can be seen in some of his paintings. 

Aitchison loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there. He wanted to capture this light in his artwork. He painted by layering colors from light to dark, but he admits he never knows how it will turn out. He said, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.""

Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it sound easy. He believes anyone can use colors because they can be bought. He focuses on how colors look next to each other. Unlike some artists, he does not make drawings before starting a painting. He thinks that if he draws first, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he often changes his paintings many times before they are done. 

He prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their pictures while he paints. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it."" Since moving to London, he has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still inspires young British painters."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we did not like the idea because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the beginning. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members started coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skills—after all, I did not expect my parents to like the same music I liked when I was a teenager—but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main worry is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but this has not happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is certain: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. This college offers students important life experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to study for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from all over the world, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in useful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is that its students come from many different backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are £20,000 for two years, many students receive financial support. About a quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they get help from the government.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for encouraging international understanding among young people. You learn to live with people and respect them, even those you don’t like. During the summer holidays, my mother couldn’t believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

In summary, Atlantic College provides its students with an excellent education using methods that really work."
PET_47,"**Being an Older Student**

At 32 years old, I have just completed my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly and have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not challenge me. I became unhappy thinking that I was stuck in that job. I envied the students at the local university who seemed happy, carefree, and excited about their future. I wanted to be part of that.

Now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the professors because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is important for getting a good job.

Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends studying rather than going out to parties. I also enjoy the typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas. I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age is a smart decision."
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. When he was fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to create affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which sold for $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_19,"**Rebecca Stevens**

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before climbing the highest mountain in the world, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family to travel to Asia with other climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very difficult. 

""You must carry everything on your back,"" she said. ""You can only take what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I usually like to be clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. Now, she has written a book about her journey, and people often ask her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. 

Rebecca is well-known today and has more money, but she still lives in her small flat in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains!"

KET_13,"**CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds can die if they stay there. 

Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. These young birds had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds won’t know what to do when autumn comes."" He had a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. 

All summer long, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him. When autumn arrived and the weather got colder, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him the whole way. 

Bill left the geese in Virginia and returned home. This spring, he waited for the birds to come back, but they did not arrive. So, Bill flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not find them. 

When he got back home, Bill was surprised to see the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without his help!"
KET_16,"**ESTHER'S STORY**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, but Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make her own jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and quickly made back her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents did not want her to spend her time making jam. They thought she should study and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. But Esther did not listen to them. She continued making jam.

After a few months, she began selling her jam at the local market. Then, she started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where one of her friends worked. After two years, her business grew very large, and her parents were proud of her. She made many types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she needed to hire some people to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them cool.

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters from the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. Unfortunately, it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she decided to make socks. Everyone loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business began.

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers. So, she started sending the wool to a factory, where machines now make all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different types of socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. 

Jenny is busiest during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, she has many letters from happy customers from all over the world."

KET_10,"**BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON**

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave their homes and forget to close a door or a window. 

Inspector Saunders explained that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home then. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it gets dark, making it hard for them to be seen. Many houses are also empty during this time because people are still at work.

He suggested that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. Inspector Saunders also encouraged neighbors to watch over each other’s houses when someone is not home. They should call the police if they notice anything unusual. 

""We will also give you tips on how to make your house safe,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This kind of help is free."""

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming started, people searched in the forest for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move around a lot to find food. About 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and over time, their villages grew larger. Some villagers could then do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers provided food for everyone. However, farming was hard, especially when the weather was bad, and some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it can travel thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes."
KET_22,"**WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE**

Nicola Peet finished school at eighteen, went to college, and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she started working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later joined British Airways as a flight attendant. Four years later, she became a manager. Here is what she said about her job:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time flying. I teach flight attendants and help them with any problems. I also attend many meetings. My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. 

At work, the first thing I do is check flight times on my computer, and then I talk with some of the flight attendants. Sometimes, I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are doing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. 

Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, all I want to do is eat something and then go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""

KET_62,"The Weather People study the weather for many reasons, and it is important for many jobs. For example, the weather is very important for farmers. Many years ago, farmers looked at the sky, animals, and flowers to understand the weather better. Now, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even get weather updates on their mobile phones. Today, many people still believe in old ideas about the weather. For instance, some say that if the sky is red in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Others think that if cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain."
KET_49,"A great idea! Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from the same small town in Canada. They have always been friends and go to school together. Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing and swimming on weekends. However, for the last few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework. They have created a new computer word game. 

The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who has trouble with reading. Kevin learns words better when he can see pictures and hear sounds instead of just reading. His brother wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make this computer game, and now it is ready to use. 

The game includes speaking and pictures. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their game, and it will soon be available for sale around the world. Many schools are interested in buying it."
KET_31,"**HOW DOES THE IRISH POP GROUP 'BOYZONE' LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE?**

Sleeping well is very important. When I go home to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, I find it hard to sleep at night after a concert because my mind is full of music. 

Sports are also important. Before my car accident, I went to the sports center for two and a half hours a day, five days a week. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups every day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat healthy food. I also drink a lot of water because it is good for your health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I don’t always drink that much.

People should not work all the time. I love my job, but I also enjoy other activities. In my free time, I like to listen to music or watch TV. It is good to relax sometimes. I don’t feel tired anymore since the doctor told me to eat better. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day. But I still eat burgers sometimes!"
KET_58,"**Bollywood**

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films. This is much more than the USA, making it the largest film industry in the world. Most Indians prefer watching films to any other leisure activity, and about ten million people go to the cinema every day. 

Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of every movie. Indian films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. 

Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but they often only act for a few years. 

Amitabh Bachchan, who many consider India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films during his nearly 40-year acting career."
KET_37,"Bill Bryson

I was born in the United States, but I have written many travel books about England. I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years. For the last three years, we have been living in the United States. Our children are now learning about life here. I believe they will be happier because they have experienced life in two countries. I like Britain and want to go back, but my daughter, Felicity, will start college here soon, so it will be another four years before I can return.

I recently spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to talk about my new book. Most writers do not enjoy this; they do not like traveling around the country to promote their book. However, I don’t mind it. I enjoy visiting new places and meeting many people. It is very different from my life in the United States when I am writing. In England, people drove me in big cars, and I stayed in nice hotels. It was great because I didn’t have to pay any bills. Everyone was kind to me, and I had a lot of fun."
KET_2,"**Schnauzer Dogs**

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes came to England more than 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer is newer here. The name ""Giant"" is fitting because these dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs to be cut regularly. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. 

Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use them to help with sheep. They are also used by the police because they are very smart. Schnauzers make great family pets. They are friendly and good with young children."

Mary Daniels is a student from England. This year, she had a very interesting summer holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help build a road through a forest between two big towns.

""It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops to buy food,"" said Mary. ""It was also very cold and wet in the mountains. It is one of the wettest places in the world.""

Mary stayed in the mountains for six weeks. It was hard work, but she says it was the best experience she has ever had. She hopes to return next year to do more work there."

**The Long Night**  
This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for many years. The story is about Maha, a nurse in northern Australia who works in a small hospital. One day, a baby is very sick, and Maha has to drive all night to take her to the nearest big city. They face many problems on their journey.

**Hard Work**  
This exciting story is Joanna Jones's twentieth book. ""Hard Work"" is about Sombat, who works with his father, a carpenter, in Thailand. They work long hours making tables and chairs, but they do not earn much money. One day, a man dressed in black buys the most beautiful table in their shop.

**Hospital or Cinema?**  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. Tina is a young woman from Brazil who dreams of becoming a doctor. She goes to London to study English and medicine. However, one day she meets a man who invites her to the USA to become a film star. What will Tina decide to do?"
KET_53,"**The History of Horse Racing**

Horse racing has been an important sport for a long time. It began in Central Asia about 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started in the 12th century when Arab horses were brought to Europe. 

At first, races were long and only involved two horses. However, in the early 18th century, this changed. Races became shorter and included several horses competing against each other. 

Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball. It is also very popular in many other parts of the world."
KET_55,"World traveler Nick Barlow enjoys his job. He is a British actor who travels around the world to make TV shows. ""People welcome me everywhere I go, and when I return home, I remember all the amazing things that happened in each country,"" he says. Nick has visited many places, but there are still a few trips he wants to take. ""I would love to visit South America and go back to Australia one day,"" he adds.

On each trip, Nick travels with a team. They bring cameras and other equipment needed to make the show. Nick does not pack many personal items; he only takes a few shirts and trousers, but he always makes sure to have some books in his suitcase. Nick's wife, Helen, is okay with him traveling for work. She has many friends and stays busy. When he returns, she enjoys listening to his travel stories.

However, sometimes there are problems. While he was in the Malaysian rainforest, Nick learned that his wife was sick in the hospital. ""I felt terrible because I couldn't help her, but she didn't want me to come home. I was so happy when I heard she was better."""
KET_50,"**Parrots**

You may have seen parrots, which are beautiful birds with bright colors and long tails, in forests or zoos. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They usually stay in large groups and enjoy eating fruit, which can sometimes cause problems for farmers. There are many types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet that help them climb and hold food. The largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are very loud, but they are also smart and can learn to talk easily. Some zoos have shows where you can watch parrots perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a lovely village about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier yet, but he is already quite famous in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old.

When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he chose not to spend his money on clothes and CDs. Instead, he used his money to travel to France and eat at good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks—he says he has more than two hundred and fifty!

So, why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says it is expensive to start your own restaurant and much harder to cook for fifty people than for your family, but he is sure he has made the right choice."
KET_34,"**John Pickering**

In a small town in central England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers in a park. Last week, he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television. John is currently the number one singer in Japan. 

A few months ago, John visited Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on his radio show. Many young people called the radio station to ask for his songs to be played again. In Japan, John uses the name Jon Otis when he sings.

Despite his success, John plans to keep working in the park in England. He is not sure how much money he will make from his music. ""I must keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have to pay my bills!"" The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan and have never heard him sing.

John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This will not change the way we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"**Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have started a new hobby called line dancing. In almost every town, you can find clubs and classes for this fun activity. 

""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to make new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. The boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!""

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"**The Rhino**

There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the other types live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough, and they have very little hair. A rhino stands on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. 

Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they eat grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilos when it is born and stays inside its mother for around fifteen months. An adult rhino can weigh over 200 kilos and may live for up to 50 years."
KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, there are police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police at all. A few old men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London was growing. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, so people stayed at home as much as they could.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to stop the thieves. They were like police officers and were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown very large and needed more police.

So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was created with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are paid well, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others."
KET_30,"**Attention Students:**

Would you like to join a camping trip this weekend? We will travel to the forest by school bus and stay at a campsite from Friday to Sunday. The campsite has hot showers, a small shop, and you can rent bicycles. The cost of the trip is £25. It gets very cold at night, so please bring warm clothes and wear sturdy shoes. If you want to come, please let me know today.

KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people come to Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come to take part in the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are filled with music and dance from morning until night. You can even see artists painting on the streets. One of the best parts of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists come to the Festival to watch new films, plays, and listen to famous musicians. This year, there will be over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. The tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be hard to find a place to stay, so why not book your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

First, you break the ice to make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. You put the line through the hole and into the water. When the fish eat the bread, you pull the line up. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! 

Today, I have caught twenty-five fish! It's a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

Hi Anna,  

I'm not having a very good week! Yesterday, my team played a volleyball match, but we lost. The other team was much better than us! Then, my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called with bad news. He can't visit us during the holidays because he got a summer job. Now we can't go camping together.  

This morning, my sister woke up late and took my bike to school without telling me. I'm really angry with her.  

I hope you have some good news! Please write back today if you can.

KET_11,"**Madame Tussaud's**

One very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Here, people can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, made wax figures of people and opened a museum in Paris. Marie helped him with this work.

In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. While in prison, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. At that time, bicycles were very expensive, and only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked quite different from the ones we use today. 

As bicycles became cheaper, more people started to buy them. Many began to ride bicycles to work and for fun. Nowadays, people often use cars instead of bicycles because cars are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to ride bicycles to work. They believe there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking."
KET_63,"**The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14**

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were excited to see the elephant show. 

We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their trainers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. The trainers sometimes gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took away the old one. Slowly, following their trainers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another showed a tree, and the third showed a bunch of flowers. When the trainers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one.

We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats dislike water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot outside. 

Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These groups work together to hunt for food. Lions usually inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and easily track other animals. 

All cats have excellent eyesight, which helps them catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."
KET_36,"Dear Mrs. Brian,

I am sorry, but I cannot come to your class anymore because I have to go back to my country. My sister is getting married next month, and I want to go shopping with her to choose a dress. My parents will prepare a big meal for the guests, so there will be a lot of work in the kitchen.

KET_20,"THE OSTRICH

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few left in the wild. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn while running. Ostriches can run very fast, between 65 and 90 kilometers an hour, making it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"Text: Victoria Jamieson is a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain. She started snowboarding at the age of 20 and has won many competitions. Last week, we talked to her at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland. We asked her why she began snowboarding. She said, ""I have always enjoyed sports, especially skiing, so it felt natural to try snowboarding. It’s easy to learn, and you can get really good in just a few months.""

We also asked her about practice. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because it is so beautiful. But for me, free-riding—doing what you want when you’re not in a competition—is the best part.""

Finally, we asked her what is important when learning to snowboard. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It’s also important to wear the right clothes so you don’t get wet, especially because you will fall a lot at first!"""

KET_64,"**Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are several paths to the top, but the Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. This path takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. 

However, only half of the climbers who attempt to reach the top succeed. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start of the climb, it can be hot and rainy, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow, and the temperature can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"**Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, which allows it to stay underwater for several minutes.

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, and many fish and insects died, so otters could not find enough food. But today, there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again."

KET_59,"**Buildings**

People have always built buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. We also have buildings like museums to display beautiful things. 

Many people work together to create a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures to show their ideas. Engineers ensure that the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof. However, the building looks great from all sides, not just from the top. Another well-known building is the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting structure looks like a tent made of glass."

KET_32,"The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large picture of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. No one knows exactly when the Cerne Giant was created, but it is believed to be a very long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill."
KET_61,"**Gail Rollins**

Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to compete in the 10,000 metres and maybe the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in big competitions. She always smiled and laughed, which made people in her city love her. 

Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with a very good time, the fastest of any British woman that year. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. However, it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him and he cannot keep up.

Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. She always takes a break from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music, and he soon began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years, and then he returned to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German, but he taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two years old, and a year later, he began playing the piano. He gave his first concert when he was six. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef loved music, but he was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now, but one day he hopes to write his own music."
KET_28,"**Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. ""My ten grandchildren don’t live nearby, but they also read my stories and tell me if they are good or bad."" This way, Bill has learned what young children like to read.

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His fifth book is his favorite: *The Sheepdog*, which is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are very clever; they learn quickly."" Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn’t change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of places like beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the pictures are often nicer than the photos people take themselves.

The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards showed images related to current events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these postcards because newspapers at that time did not have pictures."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur because the last one died about 60 million years ago, long before people existed on Earth. We do not know exactly why they all disappeared. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. 

Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were more than 5,000 different kinds. Some were very small, while others were huge. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs."
KET_41,"**BEARS**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can kill a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well, and like most animals, they find food using their sense of smell. 

There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are actually black; they can be dark brown or reddish-brown. 

Many people love the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Unfortunately, not many pandas live in the forest today because it is hard for them to find food."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm areas of the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can swim quickly and also move fast on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat many things, including fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat larger animals or people. There are more than ten different types of crocodiles, and they all have very sharp teeth. Although they lose teeth often, they quickly grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much bigger. They can live for a long time; the oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. 

Over the next thirty years, airplanes changed a lot. In the 1950s, airplanes became much faster because they were equipped with jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world, flying at 2500 kilometers per hour, which means the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. 

Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round and had no roof, so people could get cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, which was by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, talk to their friends, walk around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! 

Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
