CPE_15,"**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we handle rubbish is quite similar. Municipal refuse collection happens regularly, where rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to a local dump. Economists find this system strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, which increases costs for local authorities.

The basic economic problem is that if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to charge households for the cost of disposing of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling points. However, research by economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman shows that this logical approach can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results.

Their research looked at several American towns that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these tags are collected each week. In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman focused on a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 residents. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors found that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of those running the program.

Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people crammed more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfill sites. The actual weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs, only fell by 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. While it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already participating in a voluntary recycling program.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman examined the economics of rubbish in greater detail. They found that while pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish quantity by 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.

This raises the question of whether other factors, such as income and education, are just as important as price. For example, wealthier towns tend to produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the outcomes are not as positive as we hope."
CPE_19,"**Work and Change: Insights from Theodore Zeldin**

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work lives might change in the future. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Simply being successful in your career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even those who are famous often feel bitterness despite their success. In the past, enjoying your work was enough to be part of a lucky few. Now, it’s important to consider how your job affects you as a person, including your mind, character, and relationships. This is a vital question. 

No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you dull and unable to connect with others outside your field, or if you are so focused on details that you lack time for wisdom, creativity, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for this lack of personal fulfillment. I am trying to find ways for work to prioritize personal satisfaction instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, help us discover hidden talents, and foster diverse human connections.

However, changing this system will not eliminate unemployment. This is too simple a goal because as more people become educated, they seek jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. We should view a lifetime of work as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. Even middle-class jobs, which once seemed liberating, now often feel stressful. For example, doctors may feel more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely get to use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values align with those of their organizations.

I have started a study of various occupations to see how they shape and sometimes harm individuals. I have looked at how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am concentrating on finding more fulfilling ways to earn a living. While many experts focus on increasing profits for companies, we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider what kind of people we want to work with.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice? For instance, in the hospitality industry, which employs 10% of the workforce, there is a huge amount of untapped potential. Many intelligent and energetic people endure low pay and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz, which represented a 19th-century idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other.

Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they often have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers that actively connect guests with the city and create genuine relationships. Hotel owners could utilize the knowledge of their student employees instead of assigning them only basic tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would discover many additional services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 

It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and to move beyond traditional categories. For me, work is about relationships. As many people seek more than just obedience in their jobs and view work as a way to express independence, they should have the opportunity to design their own roles and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with minds that may initially seem very different.

Everyone understands the importance of communication, but true conversation is different. Traditional conversation differs from the new kind of interaction that many people feel is lacking today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between participants, allowing for a deeper understanding of one another. It is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Each meaningful conversation we have can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a successful outcome, assuming the right conditions are present. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is connected to two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was closely linked not only to strong economic interests but also to the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly used for public entertainment in the USA and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public places rather than at home, especially in Britain and Germany.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. However, these systems did not pose a real threat to the rise of domestic television. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide audience at home was the most effective way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of a home filled with entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, there was more centralization of wealth and political power, and traditional communities broke apart, leading to new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.

Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently communicate important information to all citizens. It also served as a tool for creating a unified 'imagined community' within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television.

However, it is important to recognize the positive view of broadcasting as a social tool that can support democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries focused on broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed and active participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is natural to want to create a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities, often sending the message that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive advertisements constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all encouraging us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research institutions and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living organisms. Caves are a small but intriguing part of the natural world, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans can. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-experts to understand, and it may seem like there is no place for simple weather knowledge. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is primarily about music, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.

At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching athletes; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate an actor's skill and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though actors frequently get asked how they memorize their lines. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often meet on more equal ground, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question is whether music can learn from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can, especially because I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humor, and intimacy. It connects with the audience not just as individuals but as a group. The traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also interrupt the flow of the performance. 

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. It was a powerful musical experience where the skills and generosity of the musicians were central, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just spectators but also participants.

What I hope for in music is a bit more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in a conventional way, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.

As an enthusiast of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to thrive and for more people to enjoy the pleasure I find in being part of the audience."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I do not enjoy it in its natural form. To me, it is mostly an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can even swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days, you will find sand spilling out of your shoes and making a mess when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than many illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.

**Lock and Key**  
The desire for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. While old wooden beams have been replaced by electronic locks that use plastic cards, the need to keep out intruders remains. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locking systems that use smart cards to control electronic locks. However, people do not seem to like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of using a physical key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I understood more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, the goal is not to analyze art like a school essay but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has never worked for me. The new gallery has tried to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that explain the context and meaning of each piece. Instead of just staring at the art as I used to, these explanations helped me gain a better understanding."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films usually means reducing, condensing, and removing parts of the original story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses. 

In novels, repetition can include reminding readers of character traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help readers understand better. In dialogue, we can often guess who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. Stage plays, which mainly consist of dialogue, mimic real speech with varying levels of style. In some modern plays, the dialogue can become overly repetitive, serving only to connect the speakers without clearly communicating anything.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, people can feel completely immersed in the film's world. This experience allows viewers to escape from reality for the duration of the movie. However, once the lights come on, this illusion ends, and viewers return to the real world. People often do not feel accountable for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality can lead to a lack of serious consideration of movies as an art form. Many from previous generations, including our parents and teachers, viewed movies as mere entertainment rather than art. While they enjoyed being entertained, they did not appreciate the artistic value of films.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios consisted of many different buildings that were confusingly arranged. There were a few recognizable places, like the Script Department, but most of the studio was made up of small, similarly furnished rooms. These rooms were used for both official and unofficial meetings and could only be identified by a strange system of letters and numbers. Finding a specific room without help was quite challenging. 

The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances instead, which made it even more confusing for newcomers. However, there were not many outsiders, as the organization preferred to keep them away. It was assumed that employees could navigate the studio without issues. Through their hard work, they created films that allowed couples like Jane and George, and Sally and Dick, to escape their everyday problems for at least three hours.

**Film-Makers**

It seems that almost everyone wants to make a movie. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and many universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that provide equipment like the handheld camera used by Robert Rodriguez to create his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched his career as an independent director. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to make his breakthrough film before turning 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning the craft by directing low-budget films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to work independently."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western part of the city, with many rows of small, shabby homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the air was filled with a strange smell of sulphur from the May and Baker factory, which was two miles away. One common sight in that area of Norwich in the early morning was a paperboy making a face of disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 

There are also other memories, like my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the towers of a large mansion in Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never fully understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that her personality was unusual. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was not common in our neighborhood. This sometimes led to intense spring-cleaning sessions or her telling us to ""behave properly."" I never fully understood her moral code, which included not wandering into neighbors' gardens or risking their rose bushes while walking down the street. It meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio shows that my mother liked. There were many rules and restrictions.

Over time, other figures appeared in these serious early memories. Despite her loneliness, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that this trio was not good company. They often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I belonged to.

Reflecting on this, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" was on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a strict routine. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and bothered your parents. I remember long, aimless days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats, but my mother usually let me go with other kids in the street.

If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was a vague old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and once there was a charity fair at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" 

My mother often talked about how people had mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she likely imagined it as a fancy post office where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible citizens. I might be exaggerating and overlooking her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. However, there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been taken from her.

To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn’t completely dislike this activity and eventually began to form opinions about the art. I remember one time she stopped in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and said, ""Well, I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small grooves in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I often skated or scooted over.

As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and surprisingly, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents organized their spaces and lived with the lingering smells of the products.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be lifted from trains nearby. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. He explained, ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was difficult to relax or focus on work when everything was visible.""

To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and directed attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also contains sentimental furniture from his parents or items he found at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life and writing are filled with secrets and contradictions, making him a fascinating figure. He was a brilliant and unique writer, known for his first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977. This book changed travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insights of great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction; he often changed details to create a more engaging story or to highlight the idea that travel can reveal hidden histories meant to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam breaststroke, my eyes were just above the water. Each raindrop created a small fountain that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain intensified, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the pool as if it were reaching for the sky. It was during this heavy rain in the summer of 1996 that I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, escaping the frustration of my usual routine, like a tiger pacing in a cage.

Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path and breaking free from the official narrative. A swimming journey would let me explore the parts of our world that still hold mystery, like darkness, foggy woods, or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent studies suggest he was likely mistaken. Scientists now emphasize the social importance of crying, with psychiatrist John Bowlby noting its role in forming the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. The sound of crying seems to matter less than the visual message it sends. Crying may have helped early human groups by fostering trust and social connections. 

There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for someone facing great injustice. Sometimes, tears come unexpectedly, even when we feel embarrassed, such as when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We often cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying is clear, but research on this topic is ongoing."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some understanding of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil.

Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support a population of six billion. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. 

Over the last century, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising gas levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict the current and future situations. 

We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last hundred years. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models simplify reality and have many limitations. Their predictions are only rough estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. 

Despite these challenges, most experts agree on one crucial point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the world we will live in over the next few generations. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15 to 95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas.

These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humanity. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential resources for society. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. 

In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops.

However, many predicted effects of future warming are concerning. Even small climate changes can affect water availability, either through long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to arise first in dry regions and areas where demand or pollution have already caused shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades.

Another negative effect is the change in glacial processes, which will impact ice in glaciers, the ground, and the sea. This will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will happen because warmer water expands and because of melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees.

The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands and for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."

This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. 

It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable, as they will help improve future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences. This separation makes it harder to understand their significance.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of certain artworks create established ideas that can block new perspectives. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When we isolate artworks from their origins and their impact on our experiences, we create a barrier that obscures their broader meaning, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then exists in a separate world, detached from the materials and goals of other human activities.

Therefore, anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts faces a key challenge: to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not separate from the earth but are part of its natural processes, theorists of fine art must show how artworks relate to ordinary experiences.

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion. To truly understand artistic products, we may need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the everyday experiences that we usually do not see as aesthetic. We must take a detour to reach a deeper understanding of art. While it is possible to enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of the interactions between soil, air, water, and sunlight.

To grasp the essence of art, we should start with raw experiences—those moments and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something separate and special that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 

Today, the arts that resonate most with people are often not recognized as traditional art forms, such as movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the mistaken belief that art should be separate from ordinary experiences. In fact, the times when art is most appreciated are when it is closely linked to everyday activities."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a stunning display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows to surround their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be perfect social animals, setting aside their differences to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have a different perspective. 

When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping others at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we would find the answer in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. 

To the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions. It has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the direction of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and loud guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. 

This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as clever songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more emotional tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. 

The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, which is an impressive achievement in an era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. In the end, he bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life.

As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten.

When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. I’m mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these is usually either a junior member of the editorial team or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much power, but they are generally looking for something original. The junior hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced person wants to keep their freelance job.

If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in a meeting. The editor who supports your novel must justify its acceptance based on its quality and potential sales. They also need to consider whether you, as an author, seem like a long-term investment, which you should have assured them of in your letter. Additionally, they will evaluate how marketable you are, as this is crucial for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 was particularly tough: the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, consumer spending dropped on almost everything except essential items, over half a million people lost their jobs, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business suffered, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% decline.

While many people lost their jobs during this time, those who remained in advertising felt especially pressured. They were seen as responsible for helping companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were often asked to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. 

As a result, marketing started to receive more attention from management, and some brands began to be marketed effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals, but it also added to their workload. Marketing was often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals increased. 

The early 90s marked a significant downturn for the advertising industry, partly due to the economic situation. However, there were also deeper changes that would not simply disappear when the economy improved. The recession led clients to closely examine their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies struggled to see the return on their investment in advertising, making it feel like advertising was on trial.

Client companies expressed a desire for better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work on their projects and to be motivated to produce excellent work. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for advertising professionals, it highlights that they faced the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

Several factors made creating effective advertising even harder. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including demographic shifts in the West, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising internationally.

These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those looking to improve is not readily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy managing these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often keep their strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some insights, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. They tend to portray the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Allure of Cooking**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This choice was unusual among my peers. Most of us did not see cooking as a desirable career. On the surface, it seems unappealing. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected my appreciation for beauty. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was an eye-opening experience. I still remember my starter vividly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to kneel and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This inspired me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The swimming instructor at my school was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. On my next visit, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt extremely high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise faded, and I felt surrounded by silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. I thought to myself, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveler**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveler seems both strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through huge waves, and eating insects if there is nothing else available. They can live for months in uncertainty. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we often dismiss it as irrelevant. We can simply return to our lives with microwaves and answering machines, relieved that our own risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be an expert sailor, but he is certainly skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences on the water. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it has changed the way people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented about a thousand years ago, sailors have focused more on it than on observing the waves and feeling the ocean. As a result, the sea has become just a space to navigate, rather than a vibrant environment. Because of this, Raban believes that a sailor can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods, which may be why he has time to carefully observe the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in classic books from the past or from different cultures because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, using words we might struggle to find. What is shy and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed by them, which is even more striking when the work comes from a distant place or another time. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are. 

Through reading and travel, we break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and this is similar to reading a great book, which reveals things we might have overlooked before. Our minds become like radar, picking up on details we hadn’t noticed, such as the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness we didn’t know we felt.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to restore parts cut by the editor, but I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have been endless. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer reflect my thoughts at that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in the moment, unaware of what would happen next, focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it, except for the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label covers everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through Australian gorges. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during those long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to pick it up again when I moved on, and my notes sometimes replaced detailed writing. Worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, I surrounded those sections with many warnings. Eventually, I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace the beginnings of fashion to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with what we wear have also become more complex. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly signifies. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writer**

Media reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. In my experience, especially since I am not on the best-seller lists, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that provide security, even if their books are not quickly published or made into films. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, leading workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the support of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our supporters at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not performing, it was hard to leave home without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our admirers, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, innocent confidence that only people who are usually shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick rise in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 

It is clear that access to music will keep growing, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, music is present at all major state events. For individuals, music offers many formal and informal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments. I believe that there will still be a strong interest in learning instruments. 

The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various jobs, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, there is growing evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one way to measure intelligence. While these findings need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help young children focus better, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to better study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

Looking further ahead, will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages may want to participate in making music, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions. If this future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require adjustments to the curriculum and how progress is measured, making them relevant to a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be essential. They must learn to motivate and teach students of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 

Positively, this change offers a chance for everyone involved in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is vital, but it is often taken for granted. Those in the music profession at all levels need to collaborate actively to ensure this perception changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work and personal lives in interviews. Instead of sharing meaningful insights, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. Discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is often evident in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the character's transition from boyhood to manhood with impressive simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with suppressed anger, displaying both sharp wit and warmth, making him both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.

**What is Acting?**

What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it create something new? This question lies at the heart of theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal method starts with a process called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, when the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a memory, like waiting in line for a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen without overthinking.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It can feel isolating if the people working there seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience, ensuring that everyone feels engaged. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should support the human voice and body. If the space feels too large, it disconnects the audience from the performance. Many theatres built in the late 1800s successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that have a sense of history, like old stone steps that show the presence of many people over time. 

When it comes to plays, you can't please everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want because they often don't know themselves. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older generations. This music opened doors for future rock stars, who listened to it with admiration, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for a whole generation of aspiring rock stars. Just like the young John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Liverpool, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show and was ready to take the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.

**Snow**

I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**

Many books now offer guidance on qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of confusion about how researchers analyze their findings. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insights into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than creating a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 

There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. Technology can be useful for teaching our children, but traditional education still plays an important role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film-making moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, which is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. 

Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to escape Hollywood, wanting to work there but live elsewhere. Still, it remains the main place for anyone important in show business.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a new form of art. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in a long time. This upset many traditional artists. After initially enjoying this new form, art critics claimed that photography could not be considered art because it was too dependent on reality and mechanical processes. 

Despite the criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils—to interpret the world and show nature, objects, and people.

**Book Illustration**

During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was clear that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, although the number of these books decreased over time. The children's publishing industry was active but mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality works, even though the best artists always gave their best effort. 

As a result, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable works, making it a great place for research or casual browsing. Many treasures from this period are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this art form is growing again, and we can expect to see new editions of classic children's book illustrations in the future."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Look where I am,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences.

The internet offers many exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, leading to dreams of wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this online world, we often share personal stories and photos without realizing the risks involved. Eventually, we may feel overwhelmed and lost in this crowded space. It can be discouraging, but there is hope. The path forward has been mapped out by early internet pioneers who explored these challenges long before social media existed.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online on what was then called the ""WWW,"" a space mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his personal experiences. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with links, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking behavior, there was also a unique beauty to his work that many appreciated.

However, one day, visitors to Hall's blog found it replaced by a single, emotional video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, his partner told him, ""Either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall realized that sharing his life online made it hard for people to trust him. The blog was removed, but the challenge of sharing online remains. While sharing can be enjoyable, expecting it to make people want to be close to you can lead to disappointment.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman working in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which cost her the job. Researchers studying online behavior call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary tale about the risks of online sharing, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life wisely. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: just because the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common problem in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. 

One main concern is that ""People need more sleep,"" says a leading sleep researcher. Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic. Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing they needed more rest.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns.

Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator where participants are asked to drive while answering questions. They always come in at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. 

During the simulation, one participant tries hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he falls asleep briefly, causing the car to veer off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

Despite these findings, there is still much we do not know about sleep. It is understood that humans, like other mammals, sleep in cycles. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries.

Scientists have some certainties: women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons for this are unclear. Some researchers even suggest that sleep allows us to ""travel through time without injury.""

Historically, sleep patterns have changed. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This time was often used for reflection or even nighttime activities. However, by the 17th century, with the rise of artificial light, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. 

The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making people work longer hours in lit buildings. Yet, in many non-western cultures, flexible sleep patterns still exist. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, constant noise and the need to stay alert make uninterrupted sleep difficult. It seems that people everywhere are struggling to get enough sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about very expensive cowboy boots—really expensive ones. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I wasn’t one. It just didn’t feel right. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I didn’t belong there. 

I flew in from Denver just after dawn, thinking I might look like an old cowboy arriving from the sky. But that thought disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty t-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a worn canvas bag from the luggage belt. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and walked out without saying a word. 

I thought there should be some clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. Something that would make me feel comfortable wherever I went, instead of feeling like everyone was speaking a different language and moving at a slower pace. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 

I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have a backup plan for when he stops racing. I thought I had some ideas, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. I considered being a commentator at races, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also thought about selling classic cars, but that didn’t work out either. It was a tough year for selling old Ferraris, and I decided to step back before I lost everything. 

Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to listen for a few minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I really miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car, feeling the speed of zero to one hundred fifty miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. 

I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. Being somewhat famous has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to brag that they knew me. Young boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. But now that I don’t race anymore, things are different. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have plenty of free time now. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I noticed some little brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents enjoy walking through the streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best effect in our work, which makes writing a letter feel less spontaneous. True creative artists, who may rewrite their work many times, do not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful and showed his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, elderly people waiting for the opening of a new Superbuy store didn’t care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bouquet of flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the possible reactions of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do well at the box office. It was only when it was shown on television that people started to appreciate it again. *Citizen Kane* is often seen as a film that has inspired many to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went ahead and created the film. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who resembled Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he approached the project with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t really understand. Dermot asked her, “Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?” She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost a waste to spend the day doing nothing.” Dermot smiled back and said, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she replied.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature often leads to amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more appealing or professional job title. If our desire for recognition is so strong that it overshadows our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I was always inspired by how light fell on different surfaces. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect shot, as long as I had film in my camera. My approach was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my way of working for a long time.

Once, I got lucky when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became very popular, appearing in newspapers and magazines worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, but I knew that you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life took some unexpected turns, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I thought was good.

This assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice payment for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showing the beauty of daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. I accepted that some of my best work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.

After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I wasn’t told. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna sounded like a great opportunity.

They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy summer trip with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It was hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. I felt excited as soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs. I was ready to take some amazing pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was determined to let it reveal itself to me. 

A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The overnight snow made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral, which towered high into the grey sky but appeared massive at ground level. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room, and even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed from a serious space into one full of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 

Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for many years, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. These are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering and connecting ideas on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from daily life with its themes of leisure and relaxation. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's lively personality and humor, which make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks depth? 

Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. In response, one could argue that his popularity today might be seen as a negative rather than a reflection of his artistic value. Hockney himself is aware of his limitations and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced concept. 

As a curator, I wanted to create a show that opposed this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse space for an exhibition called ""Window-shopping."" This was meant to showcase individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opening it up and poking around until it broke, creating a flickering display on a monitor. 

These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but I believe they complemented each other through their differences. While I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, I think it is important to recognize that art is often an individual activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. 

Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we are experiencing. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our enjoyment is complex. How we respond to art is influenced by our senses and is shaped by the values of the society we live in. 

While it is essential to appreciate our instinctive reactions to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment comes from a past view that saw art as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. This stone felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold first became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We walked quietly down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the center of St Ives, struggling against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows of the houses by the water were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark clouds gathering, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived during peaceful times or faced hardships are no longer alive. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these digital societies and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys and observed an interesting event. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby, who seemed interested in joining their group. If the stranger succeeded, the current dominant male could lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This made the stranger retreat back into the trees. The dominant male repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, he made a mistake when he called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey conducted in the village of Felmersham, 70 cats were observed over a year, and they caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that this means cats in Britain could be killing around 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, which helps keep bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with great care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who often sleep near their owners, slowly leave their resting place to go to the reed beds beyond the water. They take their time, groaning about the tiring day ahead, until the leader finally steps forward and enters the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are so slow that they go almost unnoticed, but eventually, they are swimming, barely keeping their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on whatever green shoots they can find.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles on scales. Despite being on the slab, the fish appear alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors that create a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes and the chain around one fish add a sense of danger, suggesting an underlying violence in the scene."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activities. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The first pictorial records date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They might have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. It was seen as the peak of Western visual representation, with the camera working like the human eye to create fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used to fix images allowed for the capture of what we consider natural phenomena.

At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had struggled for centuries to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural differences. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as other forms of communication, like language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality?

Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear window into reality. For example, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes of those who use it have changed significantly. This change may be partly because photography has moved into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.

I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, making one mistake can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best advice is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify a point. One effective way to include a flashback is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward without slowing it down. Dialogue is also very useful; it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Avoiding excessive writing is crucial, but being concise doesn’t mean the story should feel incomplete. A short story should maintain conflict and action just like a novel, but every word must be meaningful in a limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Most players make moves without knowing exactly what will happen next. They might see a few moves ahead, but often they play without a clear plan. As players gain experience, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. They start to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies. The same applies to screenplay writing; the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally communicate, as seen in how children talk. However, no child instinctively knows how to write. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human instinct, writing is not. All societies have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily become better. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but learning to write is a skill that requires effort and instruction. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end it with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to share what I know.

To protect the privacy of living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, and long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book.

I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians do by putting words into the mouths of my characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be dull if simply told. I want my book to be engaging, and I think I am justified in making it readable. A thoughtful reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.

Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe we can only really know those from our own country. People are shaped not only by who they are but also by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. These experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you can only understand people from a different nation through observation, it is challenging to portray them convincingly in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general approach. You can give broad descriptions and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen through my own perspective, just like my main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. However, future generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Today, the poetry scene is particularly complex, with many different styles, groups, and opinions about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 

A major discussion in contemporary poetry is the tension between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work in front of an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in various forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students, and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.

The impact of these events, where poets often have to perform publicly, is complex and can have uncertain benefits. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and creativity may become apparent.

On the other hand, dedicated poets, who strive to create deep and meaningful work, may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best writing.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to focus their attention. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes combined with music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this approach has its challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may also affect the informant's responses. Therefore, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from their childhood. The emotions expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may actually reflect later experiences rather than the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a few species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study natural behaviors in wild animals. Although these two fields have different focuses, they are increasingly working together. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. Behavior has its own structure and elements that need to be examined. For example, trying to explain how a bird builds a nest by only looking at individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experiences in social life that may make social sciences seem like common sense, each discipline goes beyond this basic understanding. Each field focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses different research methods, and has its own concepts. These fundamental ideas form the ""logical basis"" of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He also provided Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best designs for different types of buildings. At its core, his definition emphasizes the artistic aspect of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early buildings were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, even going over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, where there was a strong smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that Lily was driving without telling him. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early and returning by noon to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, although Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. Lily even overtook a couple of slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her concerns. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with its small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street with many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. She thought this might ease Mui's worries. 

While driving, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror. She decided not to add to Mui's worries. Lily carefully locked all the van doors and checked each one. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to look at the grey sea. He held his son close and felt a strong bond with him. Man Kee, warm and responsive, placed his tiny hand on Chen's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son in his own way, giving him a good education in business, which was Chen's own weakness.

As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and hope while planning Man Kee's future. He noticed smoke on the horizon and then saw a ship shining in the sunlight. He put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he struggled, but then he spotted it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It's small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I once read that if you dig deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, balanced it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t consider how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not want to just let things happen. You held the handle, helping me as I pushed the bucket away from the well's edge. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, confusing and odd. Later, I connected these lights to the cartoon stars I had seen when characters got hit on the head. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. 

You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I crouched in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. 

Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What was I supposed to do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank quickly turned into a situation that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 

Suddenly, an idea came to me like a lifeline. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, one hand on my forehead, then yelled louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then dramatically collapsed on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was filling in gaps, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone to look for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 

Looking into my father's eyes felt like staring into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing the world from an adult's perspective. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, his tone full of contempt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his expression sad and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my desperate lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, even more painful than my father's words. It made me realize that this was the mature judgment of my actions, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The moving van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was particularly focused on making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, helping in her usual bossy way, convinced that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan was not crying and commented, ""That's something."" Curious, Susan asked if people usually cried during moves. Fred replied, ""You'd be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They feel fine once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""

Susan could understand that feeling. If she had been alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before agreeing to the move. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house, and they planned to move it last.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first item brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, trying to get it up. Little Robert watched in fascination while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't! I'd rather die!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, especially since Francesca was destined to be a concert pianist.

Peter, her late husband, had come home to help solve the problem. They left the piano outside while bringing in the other furniture. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from the quay below, and with the help of a local farmer's tractor, they managed to lift the piano through the window. The children were overjoyed to see it finally inside. However, the whole process was expensive, and it took months before they could afford to have the piano tuned.

""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children became too busy to visit on weekends, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She was out of breath climbing the stairs. The thought of the stairs reminded her that the banister rails had never been perfectly fixed after the move. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but now it was too late. Any moment now, they would discover it.

""Are you all right, love?"" Fred asked. ""Just the piano left, and then we'll be on our way."" Susan moved away from the stairs, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. Truthfully, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless other items that seemed unimportant while they were in place now felt full of emotion, begging for care. She felt she might cry at any moment.

Just then, the piano appeared, being carefully moved down the stairs by Fred and another mover. ""Easy does it!"" Fred called out as they brought it down and out the front door, placing it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What's the joke?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was that it should be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, one area that became accessible to many was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 

Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it meant that readers could see what others thought about a book, rather than just relying on the publisher's description or professional critics. Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This popularity led to some problems, as many reviews were submitted each day, making it hard to check them all. 

Amazon had a team of editors who ensured that reviews followed certain rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that contained bad language, revealed the ending of a book, or referenced other reviews were also banned. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to misuse the system. For instance, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. 

One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive ones under a fake name to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their own books through a special link, but Amazon did not always verify that these comments were genuinely from the authors. 

In one case, a lesser-known writer pretended to be famous author John Updike in a comment, but it was quickly identified as fake and removed. The real drama often came from readers, not authors. For example, when James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press, but many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared after a few days. 

Despite these issues, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as beneficial for business. They wanted reviews to be a place for discussing books, not just casual chatting. Therefore, they monitored bestselling books closely to ensure that all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. 

One classic children's book, *The Story about Ping*, inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, humorously suggesting it offered a good overview of networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare. Most reviews on Amazon were taken seriously by their writers and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying. 

The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have genuine feelings about them. This highlights the importance of allowing everyone to participate in the review process."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these views for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to constantly surprise us. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes, methods, and qualities that are still present in today’s art.

We expect artists to be different from ordinary people, possessing special talents and energy that break free from conventions. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and often become frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This language may seem childish, but bear with me. 

After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas and then to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters without any fancy designs. The sign painter follows these instructions. The question is: is the final product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find success in one style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it can lead to disappointment among the public. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully break this pattern. 

Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world. This has resulted in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating atmosphere of this hidden world designed for people on the move.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to see it that way. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am suspended in a mix of memories.

I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The true comfort of my work as an artist lies in the fact that, in the quiet moments of painting or writing, reality can be reshaped and revealed in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, art offers a joyful way to confront the pain and struggles of daily life, allowing us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Listen, this isn't good!"" my dad said. We were driving back to London after I had just finished my time at a fancy girls' school. My father, along with my brother Maurice, had picked me up and I had received awards for Latin and for being the top student in my exams. After a long talk with my headteacher, we were now heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking. Usually, my dad was very talkative, but he was quiet now. ""You can't trick me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Isn't that useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious conversation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My dad knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I’m not sure about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV dramas."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn't in the family business. You’ll go to Oxford, and after that, I doubt you’ll want to join us."" 

The truth was, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options for myself and wanted to explore them. But, like a coward, I didn’t want to upset my dad. I wasn’t as scared of him as Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 

""It's too early to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you won’t want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It’s a shame because you have the talent—the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father had raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and I had taken care of him since we lost our mother. It wasn’t hard; I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a large house in London, attended good schools, wore nice clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and business leaders—and our home was always lively with great conversations.

""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 

So, that’s what happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, but only a couple of times a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. With only a few weeks left, my tutor predicted I would earn a First Class degree in Law. I felt ready and focused. 

Then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It’s really important for me to do well, and I don’t want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell my father didn’t understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined he was—the clarity and skill with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his own way, he was a genius, and I admired that in him. It made my own dreams seem less significant. 

""Okay,"" I said. ""I’ll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning something that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At the time, however, it seemed like a smart and desirable choice. Simon had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly pushed for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for an au pair. They could have found these in a suburb or a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel like it lowered her social and economic status.

Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of thinking about his dissatisfaction. He often remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner cooking, and his grandmother's care for the tired breadwinner returning from work. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, always involved in legal causes and content with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which depended on two incomes. Now, their hard work could be threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood after court. 

Venetia confronted Simon with intense anger, accusing him of wrongdoing. He regretted not leaving his room earlier, thinking that if he had, she might have calmed down overnight. He remembered her accusations clearly: she claimed that a client, Brian Cartwright, said Simon knew about jury bribery four years ago and did nothing. Simon denied it instinctively, but his denial felt unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty and ashamed, recalling the fear of punishment from his school days. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief. He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then or now."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she recognized it. 

He wondered why Venetia was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. Was her own behavior in court always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if rumors spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,"I chose to live in this place because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented homes were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me, even if I try to stay hidden. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some herbs to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. 

It’s a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window and comments on my gardening. She is a writer with several unpublished works, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. “How’s the writing going, Jaz?” I ask. She complains about how people constantly ask her about her work. “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down,” she says. I don’t want her in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. 

“So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you,” she says as she sits in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, pretending to be young. “I should’ve gone into teaching – writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “What are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel overwhelmed by the empty days ahead. 

“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. My heart races as I speak. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy B and B?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were kids.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. 

“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?” Jaz asks about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses while delivering her rejected manuscripts. I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, those who want to be good: a bit less self-centeredness, more fiction…” 

“Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say, sounding a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She once winked at us and said, “I’ve had my moments.” We were shocked."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. While there may be aspects of our national heritage that we do not like, it is still a part of us, and it is comforting to belong to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. 

In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, modern society has disrupted many communities and families, leading to a loss of this oral tradition. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our past. It is crucial to preserve these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed like a blank canvas for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not just flat and empty; they are rich and strangely beautiful. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other unique areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. 

While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to envision the Fens has its own logic, as they are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for most people to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers and have started offering similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. 

Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that museums uniquely offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve our surroundings is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that they affect everyone. This rapid change can make some people very protective of what they want to keep, while it encourages others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation because stability becomes important to them. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and needs."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thought, a revolution that led to the development of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer understanding of the universe by examining the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

As children, Lydia and I often distrusted any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards for reading certain books. He sometimes included a few better books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter, good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the origin of human language is both secret and amazing. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad and reflects the fear of early humans living in dangerous environments. Some words in languages, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"", echo this ancient fear. Because of such odd theories, many people avoided discussing the topic, seeing it as a place for odd ideas. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become an important area of research. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who viewed language as a major way to share knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode looks at the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they only stay relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, the literary value of reviews is often seen as low. Many people, including the writers themselves, believe that reviewing is something people do only for specific reasons, like needing money or because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book. However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task.

Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a longer piece of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review of fifteen hundred words in a weekly magazine combines challenges from both short and long formats. Length is not the only factor to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. Additionally, a reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy.

It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not very fond of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novel projects. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. While some may think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, it is understandable that they want some lasting recognition, especially if they believe their best writing is hidden in those reviews.

I feel this way about my own work. My main focus has been academic writing, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce. However, in the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it is common for the same people to do both. The time has passed when academics criticized reviewer-professors for showing off or wasting time. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are also less frequent, partly because there are more reviewing opportunities now, and partly because the rewards are often small.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and for professors, reviewing helps maintain their sanity. It also serves as a reminder that they should communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may enjoy using complex language among themselves, they need to ensure they are understandable when speaking to a broader audience. Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is usually a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also engaged in another primary occupation."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes hit him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened in his absence. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.

Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There was often a small pile of letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink to life when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been violently disturbed, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if that happened.

From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his few quiet evenings at home each week. After leaving the busy office, he felt a sense of himself returning during his bus ride home. However, he often found himself craving solitude, wanting time alone with his belongings. Yet, once he escaped, he felt drained and waited in vain for a sense of identity to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that the unfulfilling work he did had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.

As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he began to question for whom or what he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and his thoughts would come and go without finding a clear path. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he might have recognized his own worth and found a way out. But he had been so eager to improve his life that he followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.

After university, he had tried to create a plan for a better future, but he was not surprised to find that his true desire was simply to get by. He applied for jobs he learned about from his friends, following their lead as they rushed toward their goals, unable to imagine that he could find a job that would also make him happy. He attended one interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. He felt relieved after a pleasant conversation with Neil, his potential boss, and did not consider the long-term implications of the job he was now facing. Neil offered him the job on the spot, telling him he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was not easy, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light turned out to be moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone in this. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify the tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will spoil. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math. However, others cannot be rushed, and if you try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be as unhelpful as trying to get a full night's sleep in half the time. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different ways work at different speeds and are suitable for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds of the mind. 

The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my body instinctively moved to keep me safe, and only later did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer does not have time to think about their next move. This quick physical intelligence can be called our ""wits.""

The second speed involves actual thinking, where we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and can be playful or dreamy. In this mode, we reflect or contemplate. For instance, sitting on a rock by the sea, lost in thought, is different from planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster ones. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury; it is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the quick mind and the slow mind.

Some everyday problems are better solved with a slower approach. Certain mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed mindset. Recent studies show that these patient, less deliberate ways of thinking are particularly good for understanding complex situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have obvious factors to consider. But when the situation is unclear or complicated, we need to use our slower thinking. 

If the challenge is managing a difficult team at work or deciding whether to change careers, it may be wiser to take time to think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and have sought to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have discussed the parts of the mind that go beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can accomplish many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognize subtle patterns, make sense of complex situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than conscious thought."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. It is a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but I struggle with casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful during breakfast. This situation does not create any practical problems for me, but at first, I felt a lack of self-confidence. I started to dread mealtimes. I would hesitate to choose a table, worried about the silence that followed when I spoke, feeling anxious like I did in the early weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes not from missing company or communication, but from losing the social confidence I used to have.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when we met, he would shake my hand politely but did not seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, regardless of their cultural background. He thought that if a film is made well, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock was very clear and logical in his self-assessment. He was a rational man and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing audiences scream. He did not engage in speculation or abstract ideas, and he did not explore his characters deeply. His focus was on film itself and the precise, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. The telescopes were basic, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have improved the production of almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have also been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

People today are facing ""overchoice."" There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products are constantly being introduced, making it hard to keep up. This can lead to confusion, stress, and a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in today’s economy, having too many choices can create more stress, less time, and more complexity. As a result, many people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a world full of excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and phone plans.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a unique group of guests at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rudeness of shop assistants, which some people see as equality today. I also find it annoying when waiters act overly friendly, as if they want to treat us like friends. I know many of the other guests' names because, like me, they have been coming here since childhood. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, allowing us to maintain our dignity and privacy, which is rare in today’s commercial world."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
The move of a remarkable production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I unfairly judged his acting. While I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life cannot survive. The exception is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms might exist there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers worldwide have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the quest for knowledge drives us, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. However, these scientists want to understand why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain it. I believe it is more important to focus on whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in discussions about the purpose of it all. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boil them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-made one. Instead of purchasing a sugary chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your creations, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would many people want to discuss business over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still scattered everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were only near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him closer to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for help. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, a story of uniqueness and strength. In her personal tale, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, leaving her with just a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, Karen realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she returned to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to learn something important in a small community, where her quiet life lacked excitement. However, she felt deep sorrow for Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, which earned him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist, but she has also started writing books for young children who want to learn the piano. Her performances are exciting and impressive, captivating even those who may not usually enjoy music. During a recent concert for kids, one boy asked her if she could play ""Match of the Day."" This surprised many experienced musicians, but Joanna found it amusing. She realized that, in the boy's eyes, she needed to play that song to be considered a real pianist. She played it and enjoyed the moment, knowing it would be a great story for her next children's concert.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she cares about how children learn music. Despite her busy schedule, she has published a beginner's piano book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and collaborating with young composers. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists.

Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. She thinks that many music teachers focus too much on creating child prodigies, while most children just want to enjoy music. She finds this more interesting. Joanna has a lot of experience teaching beginners, having taught many children between the ages of 18 and 25 before her concert career began. Growing up, she was surrounded by children of all backgrounds who wanted to play different types of music. She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speaking a little French.

Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on TV. Joanna worries that some parents use music as a way to push their children to achieve, rather than letting them enjoy it. She thinks that many children stop playing because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.

When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good enough, Joanna is careful not to criticize them. She acknowledges that her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones available to help beginners. To make learning fun, she includes stories in her books and CDs. She believes that lessons should be enjoyable, allowing children to improvise and explore the piano freely.

As children progress, they need encouragement to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear when she was younger. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. She knows it can be hard to motivate children to play a piece multiple times. Joanna didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she learned to tackle difficult pieces. Now, she enjoys practicing and considers it essential to her musical life.

Joanna sympathizes with those who struggle with practice. She believes that people should talk more about these challenges. She suggests that whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, it's important to have a clear goal. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if you make mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent writing by hand. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, it is said that emails have revived the art of love letters, with millions now being sent instead of just casual messages. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwritten notes.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed the disc to him carefully. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed a button, and the drawer closed again. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be playable to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let’s get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn’t answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point. He said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations, and this attitude is a form of egotism, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some tech enthusiasts argue that this quick reading leads to new storytelling methods. However, the idea of ""non-linearity"" is not new; many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a text in its entirety.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as it did at the Sotheby’s auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their correct drawers, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work.""

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any mechanical devices, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talent. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard skills, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact, as she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he usually wasn't supposed to be there. However, he had started to be there all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to being overwhelmed with tasks and struggling to find parking at work.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small amounts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, breaking the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge, a place full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. Even at the height of his influence, he was difficult to work with. He was officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine, but it never published, wasting the budget for many issues. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, and then even more to get him to produce anything.

At editorial meetings, Ian would criticize others' ideas sharply. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively recent development in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

By the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they often overlook other significant social changes. For instance, new work patterns may explain why breakfast became more important. As more people began working set hours, many had to start their jobs very early. Therefore, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors shape the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers interpret these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may understand the photographs printed in the paper. However, instead of just accepting the image as it is, we might ask if it truly represents the scene as it was at that moment. Does it show the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a larger situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal and set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life; you can achieve personal success, but you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me experiences that many will never have. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot to enjoy these benefits.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt transported into a beautiful musical world. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an incredible live performance. I reacted with joy and surprise as each unexpected musical variation came through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether it's love, fear, or admiration. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of important messages or omens. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my understanding, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Even if the old beliefs have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and sad. 

This connection to birds comes from a rich history of folklore that shows how people once understood the world around them. In the past, when people relied more on nature for survival, they developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, cultural changes can alter how we view these animals. 

For example, the red kite was once admired in London during the 1500s for its ability to take food from children. These birds were valued as urban scavengers. But soon, they were seen as pests and nearly disappeared from most areas, except for Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation and were reintroduced to help them thrive again. 

Our relationship with birds goes back to our early evolution. The first humans likely observed birds closely because they could signal danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The concepts of flight, song, and freedom reflect our own identity in relation to the wildness of nature. 

Some may think these feelings are outdated and no longer relevant. However, like certain body parts that we still have, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be difficult. This is why, in recent years, birds have become important indicators of environmental health. In Britain, conservationists are concerned about 30 endangered bird species, which represents not just a loss of wildlife but also a significant cultural loss. 

Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent different kinds of love and magic. Anyone familiar with the works of poets like Shelley or Shakespeare would feel sad about losing these birds. Yet, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 

Folklore is crucial because the stories and legends that survive through time create a strong connection to their subjects, more so than scientific terms. This connection evokes feelings that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their significance. 

The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me curious."""
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The main purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions were more about how easy it was to travel through the local area than about the actual distance. 

Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, and even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always show true directions. 

In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their significance. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and location, so understanding the specific style used in early maps is essential.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included on maps. To achieve this, cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, they began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.

As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, attempts to create maps of known areas increased. Astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, which led to further improvements in mapping large regions.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land's features for military purposes. This need led to the creation of contour maps. Other professionals, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also required maps for their specific needs.

Today, cartographers create maps that show various types of information, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of maps' importance in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival in cartography.

It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been a smooth process. There have been times of slow progress, interrupted by periods of rapid advancement, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the need for progress but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it is easier to copy existing maps, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be taken at face value as accurate representations of current knowledge and techniques.

The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide a valuable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and the surprising fact that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, unlike Andrew, my dreams were not life or death to me, although I might have felt differently if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of some of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for his work. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my genuine praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written that an unknown pop group had recorded, which had not helped their struggling career. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre very soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs. 

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. Soon, I was back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started the orphanages that carry his name. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger place. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried writing. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases surrounds a spinning Earth. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee, which was a big deal. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to less important tasks again. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to develop your skills."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are very few TV series that successfully capture the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, called *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong personality, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that British galleries have largely overlooked. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the prices of raw materials are falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low raw material prices.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles, resembling a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The only sounds are the machines working at the Bamboo Bike Club, the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes. I’m here to see what’s happening. There’s a lively atmosphere filled with energy and enjoyment. 

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back a method of building bikes that started in 1894. However, many cyclists find the prices too high. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies costs around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price, along with the challenge of design, inspired James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to create a bamboo bike business that was affordable for regular cyclists. After refining their ideas, they realized they wanted to do more than just sell frames; they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. 

As a result, the Bamboo Bike Club has become more of a community than a traditional business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so they run the club alongside their full-time jobs. They offer monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 

As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner parts for the seat and chain. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process requires technical skills, and James and Ian are there to help, checking every cut and joint. 

Many participants are engineers, and the hands-on experience of building the bike is a big draw. Ian reassures everyone that mistakes are normal, and if you mess up, you can just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece has been checked for quality, allowing us to focus on the bike's design, choosing from plain bamboo, black, or mottled finishes. 

On Sunday, we spend time building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it. 

James mentions that their bikes are built with extra strength, using larger tubes and thicker bindings. While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique, and that’s part of their charm. Personally, I think bamboo bikes should be for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy ride. 

I take James’s bike for a test ride, and it feels light and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes the real joy of these workshops comes when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first encountered a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she recalls with a laugh, and she was correct. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend has started her own company. Dr. Gray's short book on improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry that, according to its supporters, addresses many of Americans' desires for self-improvement. However, it also takes advantage of these desires, creating even more needs and supporting the entire New York publishing industry. In Britain, the self-help genre has produced many books that are as questionable and dramatic as their covers. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too specialized. This is a blessing. As a new type of powerful editor searches for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is marketability. ""How marketable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it relatable enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions, then admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's already a big part of the success. You know you can connect with people.""

**Autobiographies**  
There should be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this agreement is often not fully honored. There are many reasons why a writer might hold back. They may have thoughts or actions they find too shameful to reveal. They might also think certain details are not significant enough to include. Additionally, there are more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. An autobiographer might believe that the ultimate goal of their work—revealing the truth about themselves—can be better achieved by creating stories that express the truth more effectively than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they might choose to disregard the agreement from the start, labeling their book an autobiography simply to gain the reader's trust, which can help them tell their story. This can lead readers to believe they have read a true account when, in fact, they have read fiction. This can happen without any intention of being dishonest.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective stories suggest that the rise of this genre reflects the social conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often serves as an allegory. The crime symbolizes deep human desires like lust or greed, and its resolution represents the restoration of order in society, calming its chaotic impulses so that society can function properly again. In Hammett's unique version, society is restored, but it is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal represent two sides of the same character. The private investigator and his target understand each other and share a strange comfort. The detective exists between two worlds: he is too honest for the criminals and too shady for the law. He is both a criminal and a competitor. His mission is sometimes influenced by his sense of guilt, and at other times, his desire for justice is heightened by his uncertainty about this duality.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his craft and hear his advice, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying to promote his new book. Neither of us felt particularly comfortable in such a lavish setting. Regarding writing in such an environment, Gould said, ""I couldn't do it; Trollope might, but he understood the culture. Knowing the culture is essential for being a successful writer. Science, for instance, is its own world. Only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't belong to that community and don't understand its rules, you're at a disadvantage."" One of Gould's key principles is: never write down to the reader. ""Make no compromises,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language, but you must not dilute the ideas. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers feel patronized, your writing loses its impact."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping accurate time. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as decorative garden pieces. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work after he delivers it. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts exhibition long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, making it seem like they had either practiced for years or had a natural talent. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint with the same speed and precision I had seen before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure didn’t mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they didn’t question the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they learned they would be staying there for their entire holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""And we can take a boat to Interlaken."" 

Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I don’t know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 

""We haven’t changed our minds. There’s been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he didn’t know about any mistake. 

""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache,"" Dawne added, giving the name of the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said cheerfully. She was the stout woman Keith had seen at Gatwick. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We’re in the wrong hotel."" 

Again, Dawne described the bald clerk and the travel agency. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover,"" Dawne added, mentioning they heard them talking about Darlington. 

Keith sighed, wishing she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" 

""I counted you, although you probably didn’t see me,"" Mrs. Franks replied. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many different holidays at various prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 

""What I’m trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 

""But we’re not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let’s see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn’t listening. He was trying to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then boarding the plane. 

""Nice to have some young people here,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith’s thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife, looking as if she were in her eighties, said they had the best night’s sleep due to the lakeside air. 

""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn’t mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point was to escape the needs and demands of older people. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly, the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and draw lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce must be laid off."" While it may be hard to see how Shackleton's experience of surviving in extreme cold relates to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives.

One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge and accept the consequences.

His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 

MacGregor explains that Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans when necessary. ""We've developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized,"" he says.

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that one of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to be patient, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix problems quickly. For example, if you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it is better to hold on and wait for your money to come back rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, if a new product is not successful, it is important to be willing to change direction.

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another member of the expedition recalled Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were near starvation during the 1905 expedition, saying he would leave it in the snow because it was too valuable to waste.

As Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" points out, ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare today. He stands out as a genuine example of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye, which has a feeding style similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel into the wood and its long tongue to pull out the insects. In contrast, the aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unusual feeding method was first described over a century ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting abilities of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several narrow holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes quickly went for the logs with food, gnawing through the wood without needing to see the surface holes. This raised the question of how they found the mealworms. It was thought they might be using their sense of smell or hearing, but further tests showed they did not rely on these senses either. Even when the smell of the insects was blocked, or when the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them.

Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes could sense the cavities in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and listens carefully, using its large ears to detect sounds. This behavior suggests that the aye-aye might be using a form of echo-location, listening for echoes that indicate a hollow space below. It may also hear the movement of insects when they are disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are other birds, like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously, similar to a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to extract the nut meat."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how well do we know their lives and who they were when they were young? The few diaries we find often leave us wanting more, and family stories can be only partly remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but rarely do. We might leave behind videos instead of photos, but these will still only show a flat image.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardcover book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. Her focus is on ordinary lives, not just famous ones. The idea came to her after talking with her family and realizing how much of her past was fading away. ""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who really wanted to share their interesting lives. They often say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they also enjoy the process.""

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share their true feelings. One 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure, said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful memories, like my divorce, and the hurt is still there."" He wrote his story for his family, hoping they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let them read it yet. ""There are things that might hurt them, and I prefer they read it after I’m gone.""

He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led him to repeat mistakes in his life. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she explains. ""The messages they received as children affect them for life. They often marry people their parents liked or choose partners as a form of rebellion."" 

Many people express regrets about unresolved issues with their parents, even decades later. ""If someone had problems in their youth, they often still have them as adults,"" she notes. Some live their lives trying to impress parents who were never satisfied, and when that fails, they may feel the need to express their frustrations.

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Ms. Renier maintains a respectful distance. ""This is not for public sharing, and I’m not overly curious. Sometimes people share something and then hesitate, saying, 'I’m not sure if that should be included.' I include it anyway, and they can remove it later if they want. Generally, people want to be honest, flaws and all.""

""This isn’t vanity publishing; it’s not about people saying, 'Look at my interesting life.' Things are changing quickly in our world, and we often forget our past. This work helps people connect with their roots. We need links to our ancestors because families don’t gather as they used to. People want a sense of lasting legacy.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and adding her interpretation. Modern technology allows her to create everything except the binding, which features gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is well-organized and well-written, reflecting the quality of the person’s life story. 

The books are not cheap, costing nearly £3,000, with additional copies priced at £25 each. Ms. Renier receives about ten inquiries a week, but the high cost discourages many. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she admits. ""But the people I’ve worked with are often from affluent backgrounds, readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen, which is where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants."""
CAE_24,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a large collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all accurate replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefit of having plaster casts is significant: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see nearly all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can assist with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased, made to order, and typically take about a month to prepare.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, making it one of the most unique tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, known as facsimiles, to preserve the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates, which served as memorials alongside tomb statues, spread from Germany throughout medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples can be found in Britain, with the widest variety available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, and while I can't say I'm proud of everything, I have enjoyed 35 years with young children. This morning, I fed my baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We share a love for opera, theatre, books, and music, which has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I see them more as a friend than a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. Although I have slapped my children in anger, I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them whenever they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me first. I don’t want to make them feel guilty for not contacting me, as my parents did to me.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young, around 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on trips to the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with my friends and attending parties and award ceremonies without feeling out of place. I think my job, which they find exciting, has helped our relationship.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to start my political career, and I quickly had more children. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political work increased, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I’m not with them, and they don’t feel like I’m disappearing. I’ve noticed more politicians bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our kids in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think deeply about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. At one point, my ex-wife and I even lived next to each other so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was present, but like many parents from the Seventies, I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently mentioned that we were too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure instead of being so relaxed. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that way, being a parent never really ends.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. At 30, I had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, but it also makes you just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one smile from her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful and can melt anyone's heart."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other. The pilot informed the 13 students from Europe and America that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964 and based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the inside was very different. It was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous young scientists sat, feeling anxious. 

For a year, they had competed with other students to earn a spot on this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. The challenge was to come up with creative experiments to conduct in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas were chosen for this unique flight, which felt like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring up and then diving down. The goal was to create a moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft would rise higher due to its own speed before gravity pulled it back down. During the brief moments between rising and falling, everything inside the aircraft would become weightless, making the students feel as if they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and we were thrown around the cabin. Then, the engines stopped, and we quickly experienced weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One step could send us flying to the ceiling. We floated without direction; up or down, left or right, lost their meaning. Only gravity helps us understand where we are.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, causing some students to land hard. After completing the first curve, some students felt uneasy about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves allowed for ten minutes of ""space time"" for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to find out how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to investigate this, which floated upside down, and one student managed to turn it right side up using a remote control. 

However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on the device, nearly damaging it. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints are affected by the lack of gravity, which is important for building future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They believe that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This thrilling experience would stay with us for a long time. ""It was unforgettable,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine consecutive winters. I enjoyed this because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my siblings and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then it’s yours.” The goal was for us to always have a connection to New Zealand, which is special because my father grew up there. They found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is suitable for planting trees. 

I have always been passionate about land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I think my family became enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres. In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember that time as happy since I was often wet and cold. Each morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting while coming out of the Land Rover, which was warm and dry, into the rain, with my jacket still damp from the day before and my boots soaked. 

During that first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. I wore a planting bag around my neck, filling it with as many trees as I could. When the bag was full, it was heavy, but it became easier as it got lighter. The hardest part was keeping the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line to guide you. Once you are aligned, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back. 

I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, planting trees became almost automatic. You develop a rhythm and use the fewest movements needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many agricultural jobs; you train your body to perform standard movements, making the work much easier. You create a regular process: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it was fascinating. My mind began to wander, allowing me to think about many ideas and reflections on life. A lot of my thoughts about nature and our place in it started during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very rewarding since I planted them and feel a connection to their success. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such headlines make me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy. 

I should add that I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand in 1984 for three months, completely alone. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area is still very strong. In many ways, it is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth. It is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. However, the noise coming from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. Curious, I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they often starve and are never found. These three were brought to us by construction workers who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still suckling her. Although the cubs were healthy, they were cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. 

At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the feeling of their mother licking them. This helped them to relieve themselves. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, though a bit unsteadily. They seemed happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother. However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed weak, even though he was still eating normally. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that he had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it is important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. 

Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other cubs. Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return because the area had been disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother had left him; he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more variety. 

At nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, my cubs had started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with colorful bruises. 

During two late-night walks in a dry period, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, even though badgers are very territorial and will fight off others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we put sheet metal over the gate to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a campaign to build a sett for the badgers on our farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for them. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and bedding than in walking. 

The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline sponsored part of the project, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to help the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Nowadays, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before they dash off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, during his time, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" using calculations from his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding this was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley, one of only two people in England paid to do scientific research at that time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but he later sailed again. This journey took him to Rio de Janeiro, past South Georgia, up to Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a chart in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. More advanced charts based on his work helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.

Dr. Clark plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during his two years at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also researched geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and worked on other projects.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton while he wrote *Principia Mathematica*, a key work in physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with much more accurate instruments. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data collected will help improve the current model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is common to measure the strength but not the direction of the magnetic field,"" Dr. Clark explains. ""You need to know true north to measure the direction. On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground-based measurements will be useful for comparison.

Halley's Atlantic journey was significant as it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue his interest in declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to make his journey successful? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the critical eyes of the peahens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could birds develop such extravagant features in a world where survival is so competitive? How do they manage to thrive with such a burden?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, a century after Darwin's death, to find answers. Darwin believed that living beings evolved through natural selection, where the strongest and most suited individuals survive and reproduce. However, he thought that the peacock's tail was a disadvantage, so he introduced the idea of ""sexual selection,"" suggesting that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be some hidden quality that made those males more fit for survival. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it indicated something important about the male's ability to survive.

Today, researchers still debate these ideas. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging, but the 200 birds at Whipsnade, which live in a semi-wild environment and are accustomed to humans, provide a unique opportunity for research. Petrie and her team are focusing on two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have any real advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it just for show, as Darwin believed?

Observations show that the peahens do seem to prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be less affected by parasites, and their bright feathers could signal their health. There is some evidence for this in other bird species, but Petrie and her team have not yet been able to study the internal health of the peacocks at Whipsnade.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive ones. Are the offspring of the attractive males healthier and growing faster? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is based on practical benefits.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician and biologist R.A. Fisher, known as ""Fisher's Runaway."" This theory suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that trait, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to males with increasingly long tails, reinforcing the idea that females are selecting for beauty.

In conclusion, this ongoing research may ultimately support both Darwin's and Wallace's theories, showing that beauty can have both practical and aesthetic value in the animal kingdom."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix traditional and modern elements. He applied this idea to his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many beautiful yachts filled with new technology. Most of these boats are descendants of a major design change that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although she was designed last year, her appearance might make you think she is 100 years old, leading you to believe her owner is a romantic. Perhaps I am, but I’m not sure.

This boat benefits from the charm of classic design, but modern technology has made the process easier. However, it is important to note that advanced technology often separates sailors from the true challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not suggesting that sailors should face every difficulty. I believe it is essential for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor.

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change creates a cabin that resembles an ocean liner, with a bed larger than one at home. For me, a boat should always feel like a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that she had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over my time with her, I learned how true that was. Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I have ever sailed.

However, classic boats like hers require a lot of maintenance. After injuring my back, I realized I could no longer care for her. I looked for a younger boat but found none that met my needs, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design programs, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before moving to the computer. After creating a basic design, he carved a model, just like boat builders did in the past. We then refined the design using technology, and by the final version, it was perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, moves beautifully in the water, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. This may be because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture. This traditional approach has proven effective. In her calm presence, she shows that it is not necessary to follow modern trends to find happiness, and that sometimes, it is wise to learn from history. Built with wood treated to resist water, she combines the advantages of a fiberglass boat while still looking, feeling, and sailing like a true classic."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to unwind. My room in the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I did nothing but sleep. Starting on the second day, I joined body conditioning classes and tried as many activities as I could, like yoga and stretching. The instructors are very skilled, and I was surprised at how flexible I became during the week. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy (which helped me relax), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, truly makes you feel rejuvenated. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly, kind, and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer a quieter time and the weather is nice, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to return. This is the perfect getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!  
*Marcella D'Argy Smith*

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I walked up the grand staircase into the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can avoid talking to others if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, which includes an examination and a review of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt a bit strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder issue found during the exam was quickly addressed by the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious and well-presented, so you won’t feel deprived! You receive a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.  
*Liz Gregory*

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not pretend to be one. It is a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef prepares rich sauces and delightful creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, so I could work off some of the tempting dishes. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic. I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.  
*Beverly D'Silva*

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and much more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-rated restaurant, serves dishes that are absolutely delicious. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym using exercise equipment to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about all the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone the body. Cliveden has all these options if you want to use them before treating yourself at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. The worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a setback if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best night’s sleep in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse group, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This means that the traits that make us different from animals are quite recent. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other unique human traits come from just a small part of our genes. This is a significant responsibility for a limited number of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree rather than kind. For instance, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools; chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Regarding language, monkeys have simple warning calls for different predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. These findings suggest that aside from art, there are not many absolute differences between humans and animals.

However, if human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. We only have clear evidence of human art, such as cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments, starting around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we argue that our recent artistic explosion makes us unique, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three main differences are often suggested: human art is not practical, it is created for beauty, and it is learned rather than instinctive. 

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, like defending territory or attracting mates, which helps them pass on their genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by a desire for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for pleasure. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Different human groups have their own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily distinguishable. However, these styles are not genetically inherited. People from different cultures can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' specific songs, even if they have never heard them before.

The role of learning in human art is also evident in how quickly our art styles change. For instance, geese have made the same sounds for 2,000 years, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum visitors can tell that a twentieth-century painting is more recent than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when and who painted a work, but they might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day for his own enjoyment and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These paintings by our closest relatives blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the paintings made by apes did not serve practical purposes; they were created for the satisfaction of the painter. One might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend to communicate with others, while the apes did not care about sharing their work. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth and also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. In the past, children's stories featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting at distant horizons on their journeys into the unknown. Nowadays, such characters are rare in fiction and even rarer in real life. That was my belief until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert, known locally as the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a captivating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back since no one had ever completed that route; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly kind to us.""

Anyone reading his remarkable account will be surprised by the word ""kind."" The team faced terrible hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn’t experience the Taklamakan’s famous sandstorms, and we avoided the freezing desert cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn’t mean we didn’t face challenges all the time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What motivated me most was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to start now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the struggle it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert doesn’t compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — and the determination it brings. We were motivated by a sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,"**Text: Life Without Technology**

Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy manual work. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, we have been led to believe that technology is essential, and this idea is everywhere. Using our hands does not harm the environment, unlike machines that consume energy.

Recently, I had a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost me a lot to fix. This made me question whether gadgets are really worth the money and hassle. Am I as dependent on technology as I think? Gradually, I have stopped using some household gadgets as they break down. This makes me wonder what ""extra time"" technology actually gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? If that’s the case, then the marketing experts are tricking us.

When my broken gadget started making strange noises, I left it outside, where it now sits quietly. I enjoy working with my hands instead of being tied to a noisy machine. I can take my sewing with me wherever I go. There are some gadgets I still appreciate, like my washing machine, which I found very useful after a year without one. However, losing some gadgets has brought me unexpected joy. 

To avoid spending too much time in front of the television, I returned our rented color TV and switched back to a small black-and-white one. This change has helped us spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, and enjoying other hobbies. I have also stopped using my old sewing machine, which now serves as a plant table. I can’t afford to replace it, so I have started sewing by hand.

We often think we cannot live without our gadgets, but many people in the past worked hard without them. Computers now do many tasks for us, but I find that hand sewing is enjoyable and relaxing. I can listen to the radio or talk with family while I sew. If the task is simple, I can even watch my favorite TV shows without feeling guilty, as I am also being productive.

I used to think that sewing by hand was tedious and tiring, but I have discovered that it is soothing and satisfying. I enjoy seeing my work become neater and more confident. I find that things get done quickly, and I can slow down my pace of life. I also enjoy washing dishes by hand, allowing my mind to wander while I do it.

Now, I look around my home and wonder if we really need all our gadgets, like the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. In fact, we could save a lot of money by living without electric lights!"
CAE_62,"**Text: The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst**

Charles Hurst is a skilled cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It’s hard to tell if he is genuinely in a hurry or just acting tough. However, looking around his workshop, it is clear that he is very busy. The space is filled with unfinished furniture and wooden planks in many natural colors.

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a strong reputation. His order book is always full for months ahead, even though he does not actively promote himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right choice. 

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, as the craft is still alive in the countryside. However, it is harder to find a cabinet-maker who focuses on creating well-made furniture with clean, simple designs. Hurst notes, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers."" As someone who holds high standards, he often feels disappointed by modern furniture. He expresses his frustration with poorly made, mass-produced items and craftsmen who produce low-quality work. This pursuit of perfection is a big part of Hurst's success, along with his talent. He is confident in his skills, stating, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" 

Hurst is self-taught. When asked how he learned his craft, he replies, ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up."" Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return for more projects. He enjoys the satisfaction of working on an entire house for a client. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. ""The most frustrating clients are those who don’t know what they want and change their minds too late. My favorite clients are the exacting ones.""

While Hurst has every reason to be proud, he also acknowledges the skills of others. He humbly says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He criticizes craftsmen who try to be artists and take too long to finish a piece. He also finds degree shows, where students showcase their work while trying to make fashion statements, to be pretentious. ""A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something people can really use.""

Despite his confidence and straightforward manner, Hurst is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and to help us recover so we can function well.

The second theory focuses on the benefits of sleep for learning. It argues that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It claims that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we have enough for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and peculiarities. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, a habit of collecting beer mats, or a tendency to write angry letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality. 

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces. It’s like having two trains on the same track, pushing against each other. One train represents individualism, and the other represents conformity. For many people, conformity is stronger. The desire to be accepted, loved, and appreciated often outweighs the desire to stand out and be unique.

People with unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behavior often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to discuss their shared interests or issues. The key word here is 'shared.' They seek others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, can be comforting.

Most of us feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While we may follow the crowd, we often dislike being told that we are doing so. We feel a need to express our individuality, like when a man at a bar declares, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance insists, ""You must take me as I am. I don’t follow rules.""

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many people succeed in their careers by doing just that. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, has said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it with determination, you will surprise many people."" However, this assertion of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they may be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are.

A true eccentric is not focused on what others think. They act according to their true selves. This sets them apart from enthusiasts, practical jokers, clever criminals, attention-seekers, and recluses. These individuals are aware of the world around them and often react to it. Some want to impress society, while others want to escape from it. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives freely, without concern for societal expectations."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet some of the most important thinkers in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been at the center of environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. When I was a young journalist, her insights helped me understand these complex topics. Choosing her book was more difficult. I considered ""Only One Earth"" and ""Progress for a Small Planet,"" but I believe ""The Home of Man"" is her most significant work. It discusses the rapid growth of cities while addressing the larger themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book beautifully explains the fascinating world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see that their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves nature. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a fulfilling career in conservation, but it also deepened my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Many people believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, viewing all living beings as a family, regardless of their nature. This idea is important for all of us to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I discovered ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which inspired me to start sketching them. However, ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as valid as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject compared to math or physics, I began to see new possibilities for myself."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five major British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers; they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more accepting of bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views about a book since they often read it first.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, ideally in a positive way. Book reviews today are more varied and accessible than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which many people read. Weekly summaries of books are often not enough, and even original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a respected source can significantly boost sales, especially if there are multiple positive reviews.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, and we rarely advertise, so we rely on literary editors to give our books space. Positive reviews are much more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Publishers often say they care more about the length of reviews than their content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be supported by other factors like recommendations from readers, strong responses from booksellers, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., a single review from the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, booksellers often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for a good writer to gain readers. Interestingly, some poorly received books or those without reviews can still sell very well. The situation is unpredictable, although non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than on the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews, but do they actually lead to sales? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn’t sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer’s name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, people paid attention. Today, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith, one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women looking for unique gifts for their husbands, often reflecting their interests in work or hobbies.

Graham's work is quite different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he explains. 

Graham decided to focus on his weathervane business after working for 15 years as a precision engineer. Five years ago, he and his wife, Liz, switched roles: she became the main breadwinner while he took care of their children and built the business. He has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. He has now created over 100 original designs and pays great attention to detail, always getting customer approval on the design before he starts cutting.

Graham also keeps traditional designs available because they are still popular. ""People like handmade items,"" he says. ""They enjoy having something a little different."" He does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People appreciate the uniqueness, and I love transforming a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he explains.

For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction. Nowadays, as more people move to the countryside, they want to add special touches to their homes, which has helped crafts like Graham's. He has become busier, supplying weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he says. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

The beginning of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and hoping to be a director. Things started badly when a film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart almost overnight. He felt disappointed and worried because it had been two years since he earned any money, and that film was his only hope to calm an angry bank manager.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to being a television executive or started a television project that was on hold. Instead, he made a decision that many, including himself, thought was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel. Although it was an impulsive choice, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. He had met a farrier on Dartmoor who told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive for no reason. The owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were known as ""horse whisperers."" This story captured Evans' imagination.

He began to research the topic, initially planning to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after losing hope in the film industry due to the failure of *Life and Limb*, he decided to write the story as a book. Throughout the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt very alone and like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was deeply in debt, worried about how to support my children, and questioning if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from the bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for more feedback, he suggested that Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more months of work ahead. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with the summary, to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""You what?"" Evans replied, surprised. The agent explained, ""It's okay, I just feel something big is happening.""

What happened next became a significant moment in publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were in shock. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans said. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for the film rights. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent in the US, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" 

As they agreed on this amount, the studios each wanted to present their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four prominent filmmakers called one after another, eager to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me over coffee on his wooden verandah overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's all been like a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don't want to become just an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we’ll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to pursue it. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he concluded."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become more of a young person's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. He won the first game impressively, but later games revealed that he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older.

The game of chess has changed significantly in the last two decades. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Today, winning is the main goal for chess players. In international chess, a player’s mental strength and endurance are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high, with a chess clock ensuring players make their moves in a set time. If they fail to do so, they lose immediately. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also evolved. Much of modern chess preparation happens off the board. Players must prepare thoroughly before matches, especially since computers can store millions of chess games and provide quick access to information about opponents. In recent matches, players have used large teams to analyze each other’s strategies continuously. The opening moves of a game are now studied in great detail, and being well-prepared can be crucial.

Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes worldwide. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and during this time, players must maintain focus. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense situations, players must act quickly and decisively, resembling athletes in their coordination.

At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one victory is not enough to win a tournament; players must be ready for the next challenge. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing about 10 kg.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game puzzling. However, it also adds to his legacy. If he has returned for financial reasons, he is likely to succeed, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" What is remarkable about Nick is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I understand the challenges involved. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was surrounded by people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even during his time at Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that such success was likely. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from leading roles in school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting as an excuse to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a hit, but I have no idea. For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel discouraged. Just when I was about to give up, I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I was in some terrible bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry community, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I realized I needed to after I got bored stuffing envelopes at a theater."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they always thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more opportunities to write poorly. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I just produce work without caring about its quality."""
CAE_1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, believes she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she wants to avoid the wrong crowd. At 31, she is an art student who loves historical romances and is searching for Mr. Right, worried that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. Despite her concerns, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a style reminiscent of early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It offers a humorous perspective on radio, seen through the eyes of a clever but shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to showcase his dry humor and skillful writing, taking readers back to the simpler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores and old cars.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex. The poet writes poor poetry, which bothers Richard, and she seeks his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author unravels these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a delightful and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become intertwined in life and death for 25 years. At the beginning of this lengthy novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is launching a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake as the editor. The launch is important, but so is the fact that they both loved a woman who was killed years earlier. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to deeply connect with the characters.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make amends, he becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor while managing everyday life. The story explores deep emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work significantly helps development. While volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the individual volunteer could provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack the necessary skills or experience. Many studies raise the question of whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a desire to help others or if young people are more interested in gaining experiences that will benefit their careers. However, these projects may help develop individuals who will act ethically in their future careers and lives.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and increased participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help create international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the overall impact can be greater than the individual contributions, benefiting both volunteers and host communities, and contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those in communities that lack access to such opportunities. Volunteers may continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities to advance their own goals.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity from wealthy Westerners. At its best, it can provide benefits and challenges to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing issues of inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of personal strategies to help others. These limited strategies, focused on making a small difference, can seem positive in a time when political engagement is low. The personal aspect appears appealing as it avoids large government and business involvement. However, it also neglects the need for democratic representation and reduces development to individual acts of charity, often failing to address the deeper issues faced by poor rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is often misplaced, volunteer tourism can sometimes be just simple charity. However, when it is promoted as sustainable development and merges with the marketing of gap-year companies, it reflects a decline in the understanding of development issues. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from recognizing global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them get out of bed. This is why clock radios are popular. But how do you choose a good one? A panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

One model has a 'dual alarm function,' which I initially thought would let you wake up to a buzzer, snooze for a bit, and then get up. However, the instruction booklet suggests using this feature to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and one for weekends. But who really schedules their life like that? This model costs about the same as another we tested, but it includes a cassette player, allowing you to fall asleep to your favorite tapes and wake up without news. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was an issue—it’s as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best in terms of design and overall performance. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I found the digital display appealing, with its stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze bar allows you to tap it without opening your eyes. However, the smooth buttons, which felt nice to touch, distracted me when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don’t have to reset it if someone accidentally unplugs it. Everyone liked this feature, but we found it complicated to set up. Still, mastering it made us feel sophisticated.

Tom Granger criticized another model with a built-in lamp, calling it 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was difficult to position and was not bright enough to read by, as it only lit up the clock, which was already illuminated. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed that tuning the radio was challenging. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, its bright colors appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out more than the others. In fact, its traditional controls were the only ones we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin, meaning it might go off 10 minutes earlier or later than set. Paul Bridges laughed at this idea, calling the model 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model we tested scored points with Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space,' plus it had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said it was easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you can never be sure if you pressed the buttons correctly, which makes it hard to trust that it will work. However, he acknowledged that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I found the tuning a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. They are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward for protection. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, making them more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using that ability only as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during most of the day, often hiding under bushes or in burrows. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In suitable conditions, some hedgehogs may stay awake throughout the year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their dreams.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's an amazing feeling to soar through the air and land safely, but it can also be frightening. Sometimes I don’t feel well, or the weather is bad, but I push through. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete on the same courses and receive equal treatment—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day, along with stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment required.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because very few schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to a lack of stability in the women's team. Despite these challenges, I enjoy rowing and staying fit, and I appreciate the social aspect of the sport.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how vast it is! I found Britain too small and safe. I was very determined and disliked being controlled. Each walk has been unique. My walk across Australia was the most painful experience, covering 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! I had to succeed because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, making them hesitant to sponsor us.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, which you can see on the roads. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman in racing has its challenges. When I approach a corner, men think they must beat me, which has led to many tough moments. You need to be competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It's encouraging to see more women joining the sport each year. For me, the thrill of saloon car racing comes from striving for perfection.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There’s a lot of pressure before races, and I really push myself during competitions. I often wonder why I do this, and I realize it’s because a) I feel happier when I’m fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also less for women. However, we have now established an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could easily recognize Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old, unreliable van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of my time drawing and was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw the famous artist.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others while he worked in the hills. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have approached him to ask for his signature. I was nervous, but when I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, he kindly agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below. Even though Picasso's art was often abstract, it usually connected to real things, so his lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was even worse, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak freely. Still, I managed to tell Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat to show my friend what I had done. He noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and asked, ""Is that all?"" He encouraged me to go back and take advantage of the opportunity, suggesting I could draw Picasso's portrait.

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided not to ask if I could draw him, as I feared he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, set up my pad, took out a crayon, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled mischievously and made it hard for me to draw by acting out funny expressions. He rolled his eyes, stuck out his tongue, and made silly shapes with his hands. Although it was tempting to give up, his playful spirit felt like a challenge. I sensed he wanted to see how determined I was.

Eventually, Picasso settled down and allowed me to study him without distractions. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were full of life. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he appeared to be in his own world, quietly focused on his thoughts.

When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my portrait, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn't good enough. However, he insisted, and when I showed him my drawing, he nodded approvingly. To my surprise, he then asked for my crayon. He quickly drew a bearded face on the paper, finishing in just a few seconds. His drawing was lively and different from my careful work. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single, joyful line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Looking back, I feel incredibly lucky. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a great deal to me."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This article explains the techniques that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**  
Supermarkets know that customers value fresh food. To create this impression, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that fills the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind people of fresh produce. However, most items sold in supermarkets, like frozen foods and cleaning products, do not fit this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**  
The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use computer systems to find out which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit items in these spots, while also using eye-level shelves to catch attention. Special offer bins are placed strategically to attract bargain hunters. Another tactic is to place related items together, like desserts near ice cream.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers must walk past more expensive items to reach them. Chain stores also position popular products away from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and encounter other tempting products along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**  
In recent years, chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from a crowded display style to a more boutique-like approach, showcasing limited fashion items. This gives the impression of exclusivity, even though the clothing is still mass-produced. Their success comes from both good design and appealing clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**  
Food shoppers often focus more on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items to attract customers. They may even sell some staples at a loss to bring people in, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They achieve low prices by buying in bulk and negotiating discounts with manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**  
Shoppers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and pay more attention to individual prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural daylight, helping customers see the true colors of clothing. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers through the store. These paths, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" encourage customers to explore. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use more inviting carpets in sales areas to draw shoppers in.

**I. In-Store Promotion**  
As you enter a supermarket, you are often greeted by large, colorful images of delicious food, which can be hard to resist if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that display advertisements as you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and claim to increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, aged 58, is famous for reaching the top of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail, where I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first experience on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. He moved quietly and confidently.

Eventually, we reached a steep drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before, and he said he hadn’t, so I showed him how. After I finished, Robin politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit worried, but he managed to lower himself safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion to combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural progression from our Skye adventure.

I was very impressed by Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin always consulted the crew first. Most of the time, no one dared to give him advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. Honestly, I found sailing quite challenging and boring. The moments of crisis were easier to handle because they got my adrenaline pumping. However, spending day after day in the middle of the ocean was tough for me. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin is a natural sailor who enjoys fixing the engine and repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless.

The crew was also cramped, with six people on a 32-foot yacht designed for four. At least on a mountain expedition, you can get some space from each other. When we arrived in Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times while climbing when if Robin fell, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be very careful about that. I also underestimated how difficult the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the top, we were climbing for 24 hours straight. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges, but he completely trusted me and just followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted my decision. I knew he was also worried about the boat and whether it would be safe in the ice, but he still wanted to try climbing the mountain again.

The only time we had a serious issue was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns keeping watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt he didn’t trust me, which made me insecure, and I expressed my feelings. Robin quickly reassured me that I was misunderstanding the situation. While we enjoyed our trip to Skye, we didn’t truly get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin is a kind-hearted and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life since ancient times, appearing in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, people left apple remains near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as ""windings."" They were very different from the apples we eat today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including how to make cider, was brought to Britain during Roman times. One dessert apple, called Decio, was likely introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in Britain, and Norman varieties soon became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of most Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
By the thirteenth century, several apple types were well-established in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, giving rise to the term ""costermonger,"" meaning a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This trend continued until the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern-style orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them precious. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the most famous apple planter was John Chapman, known as ""Johnny Appleseed."" Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious beliefs led to many folktales about him, including stories of him sleeping with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt discovered a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named this apple ""Hawkey."" After sending it to a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was introduced to the market as ""Delicious"" and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and rejected her parents' criminal past. She worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales, and was known as ""Granny Smith"" for managing the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing among discarded fruit, transplanted it, and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she said, ""Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the fruit and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown globally, from Himachal Pradesh in India to luxury orchards in Africa. However, most apples are commercially grown and come from only a few varieties, often chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than for their taste. This trend of uniformity is dulling our taste and reducing genetic diversity. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are starting to demand more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity or any other food. We must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

Our trips are designed for anyone in good health, reasonably fit, and adaptable. Most participants are between 25 and 55 years old, with about half being couples and the rest solo travelers.

**Activities and Interests**

It’s hard to define Explore Worldwide because each trip is unique. We categorize our adventures into 8 groups, highlighting key activities and interests. Each category showcases special features of a tour, but many other factors contribute to the overall success of our trips, such as unique places, cultural encounters, and personal involvement.

**Cultural/Adventure**

Most trips have a strong cultural aspect, with some focusing primarily on local cultures and historical sites. Destinations of cultural interest include Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Belize. Many trips include short walks to visit less touristy sites.

**Wildlife and Natural History**

Our wildlife safaris take you to some of the best game parks in the world, allowing thrilling encounters with animals in their natural habitats. In Africa, you might have the chance to explore the wild on foot, tracking animals like the rare silver-back mountain gorilla or going on bush walks with local guides. Most safaris involve camping, but some offer hotel accommodations. In Asia and South America, we usually stay in hotels or lodges during game viewing trips.

**Ethnic Encounters**

A highlight of our adventures is meeting ethnic or tribal peoples, such as the Tuareg of the Sahara, the Maya of Mexico, or the Huli of Papua New Guinea. Many of these groups have traditional lifestyles that are threatened by outside influences. We travel in small groups to promote understanding and respect for different cultures while minimizing environmental impact.

**Easy/Moderate Hiking**

Many trips include easy walking through beautiful countryside, often staying in rented accommodations or hotels. Some involve village-to-village hiking, where you might stay overnight in local homes or basic huts. These trips can be found in places like Spain, Italy, Greece, Morocco, Thailand, and Nepal. On longer hikes, your main luggage is transported separately, so you only carry a daypack.

**Major Treks**

We offer a few challenging treks for experienced hikers, sometimes at high altitudes. These trips may involve staying with local people or camping in stunning mountain ranges like the Himalayas or the Andes. Support vehicles and porters are usually provided, so you won’t need to carry heavy gear.

**Wilderness Experience**

Exploring remote wilderness areas is an exciting adventure. These places, like the Amazon Rainforest or the Sahara Desert, offer unique experiences for adventurous travelers.

**Sailtreks/Seatreks**

These relaxing holidays involve traveling by local boats. We sail through Upper Egypt on traditional felucca boats, use wooden yachts in Turkey, and ferry between islands in Greece and Thailand. In the Galapagos Islands, we live on a small motor yacht.

**Raft and River Journeys**

Our river journeys can last from a few hours to several days, ranging from easy inflatable rafts to thrilling whitewater rafting. No prior experience is needed, and safety skills are taught quickly. Our river trips in India, Africa, and the Amazon provide a unique view of lush landscapes and vibrant jungles."
CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner and one of Britain's best 10,000-metre athletes, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a sunny mountain path leads from a quiet road in Nairobi. This path begins the journey up Mount Kenya, the country’s highest peak, which is covered in glaciers. This beautiful but remote place is called Nanyuki, and for the past three years, it has been my base for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners until my fourth winter training trip to Kenya. 

On this trip, I decided to break my routine. I participated in my first race in Kenya, where the air has less oxygen, and I stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after I finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. This was an opportunity I could not miss. Training at high altitude helps produce more red blood cells, which improves the body’s ability to carry oxygen. This has been proven by the success of many Kenyan runners.

My first race in Africa, which took place before my time at the training camp, was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. It was a humbling experience for me, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, and all but three were Kenyan. I felt I had run well, but I know that Kenyan success is not only due to the altitude. Kenyan runners are also known for their straightforward approach to running. Their running style looks effortless, their diet is simple, and they seem to enjoy competing.

One important aspect of Kenyan success that is often overlooked is their training. My time at the training camp revealed how they train. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The facilities are basic, with athletes living among regular students in shared dormitories. 

Each day at the camp includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training in the late morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. The daily schedule starts at six in the morning. We would wake up and gather for instructions from the coaches before the morning run. The coach reminded us, ""Run easy, you have a hard job today."" We covered about 40 kilometers each day, which is just under a marathon distance. Sundays were different, with only one run of 20 kilometers, which was a nice break from the usual routine.

Life at the camp was simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth were enough for morning preparations. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to one of the streams from Mount Kenya's melting glaciers to wash properly.

By the end of my stay, I had a deeper appreciation for Kenyan success. It cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simplicity of life in the mountains, the tough training, and the passion for success might be the true reasons behind Kenya's dominance in long-distance running."
CAE_7,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This decline started in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are deeper and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with the fast changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not. This is a major reason why advertising is not working well.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen a year, and for cars, you typically buy one every three years. You may not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even if you consider all the different products and services you buy, it is likely that you do not purchase more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In contrast, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are individually listed and analyzed. The average consumer buys only 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all of these purchases are due to advertising. This means that only about 4 percent of the advertised brands are actually bought by consumers. 

You might think that you are different and not influenced by advertising, but most people feel the same way. The reality is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many advertisements have shown that it can work. Advertisers need to reach a large audience to connect with the smaller group that will actually respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested.

Even with careful targeting, advertisers can reduce waste but can never completely eliminate it. For example, even the best direct mail campaigns do not get a 100 percent response rate. This is a key difference between advertising through media and selling directly to customers. A salesperson might succeed with every potential client they meet, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would communicate with them directly instead of using mass media.

Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is considered successful. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled to gain a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can attract more than 2 percent of the population is seen as very successful, even though this is still a small part of the total audience. To revive advertising, its messages will need to be more carefully targeted than ever before."
CAE_43,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Most Eco-Friendly Home**

Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting features. First, it is home to Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral that is not well-known. Writers who care about the environment appreciate the pagan 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in the cathedral's thirteenth-century chapter house. 

The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. This house is designed to be very green. The Vales collect rainwater for drinking and washing, recycle sewage into compost for their garden, and use waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat to warm the house. This includes heat from their three teenage children and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. 

The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and received approval from planners, even though it is in a conservation area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice complete silence. The house is very well-insulated, with special triple-glazed windows that keep out noise. 

Once inside, you must take off your shoes, as Robert insists. The atmosphere is calm and quiet. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow, as the house is designed to be draught-proof. Even the cats have their own air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to eliminate the need for mains water as well. They designed composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.

Robert explains, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness. It doesn’t have to be medieval."" The only medieval feature is the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, stretching the full height of the house. 

The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating. Soon, they will install solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden, which will allow the house to generate more electricity than it needs. Eventually, they hope to have enough electricity to charge an electric car. 

The only source of heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they claim to use only during the coldest winter days. When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he found it comfortable because there were no draughts and everything felt the same temperature. 

Robert points out that a woman from the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggests that people living in houses built before 1900 should return to that way of living, although this idea may not be popular. 

The secret to the house's success is its low-tech design, which means there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were sourced from local builders and installed by local craftsmen, making the house affordable to build—costing the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are not keen on this idea."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The Camera Never Lies

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, saw himself as a rational and scientific person. However, in 1920, he came across photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article where he accepted fairies as supernatural beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out images of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges a common belief about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In reality, it can, and it always has. Nowadays, we often use computer software to edit our digital images, and it is a misconception that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed.'"
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths, who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were respected like doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture were crafted by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased. Heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used the beautiful wrought iron that blacksmiths created. In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. Still, much of the work produced looks quite traditional, with manufacturers of gates and balconies often labeling their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks and similar items.

Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be entering a new ""Iron Age,"" as both the public and blacksmiths are becoming more aware of the craft. 

Modern power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, twist, and weld it with less effort. Dawson explains, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" The exhibition features about 250 pieces, including bookends and a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90 and going up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual artists, but a portion of each sale will support the Association's efforts to promote quality ironwork.

Dawson has created an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a hand-blown glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow into shape when it is hot, comparing it to drawing with metal in space. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals that are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, finds it magical because it is soft when hot but becomes hard and unyielding when it cools.

Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, while another resembles a Celtic cross. She appreciates the cold, hard nature of steel and how it feels permanent. No other metal has provided as much visual pleasure or a sense of security. It seems likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for many years to come, as long as we can avoid more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying, even for me. 

The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I hadn’t planned to quit, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. Plus, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop; I’m here to write, not to quit, so it wouldn’t be fair to expect your method to work on me."" I thought I was being reasonable because I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me pleasure.

The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of quitting began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that didn’t involve anyone else. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, disappeared after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it turned out to be fine. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was just relaxing at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I’ve come to realize that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to adjust to—like eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have previously smoked."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been testing my friends and acquaintances on their knowledge of her. When I tell them I am writing her biography, I watch their reactions. If they seem excited and say things like, ""Surely there's already a biography?"" they pass the test. 

Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize should be enough. Anyone else with such an achievement in literature would be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person, as complex as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects significant changes in the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read some scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend and worked in the same field. I went to the main bookstore in my university town, but I found no biographies of Pauling. I was surprised that he was not considered interesting enough for British readers, even though he was a highly influential chemist and a Nobel Prize winner in both chemistry and peace.

Even scientists have questioned the value of scientific biographies. Peter Medawar, a Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers do too. This attitude shows the divide between the arts and sciences, where only the most famous scientists get biographies. 

It is not true that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. For example, a leading geneticist told me he would be happy to discuss his work but did not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This reluctance to share personal stories can create a false impression of science and may discourage young people from pursuing it.

Fortunately, things are changing. Today, scientists often appear in public in ways other than just scientific interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help make scientists more relatable to the public.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be dry and overly respectful, often ignoring the personal lives of scientists. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been portrayed with their flaws. Readers find it interesting to see how creative geniuses deal with personal challenges, even if those challenges seem unrelated to their scientific work.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her science. She made significant discoveries, including the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, for which she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She pushed scientific techniques to new levels of complexity. However, she also raised three children and was married to a husband who was often away due to his work as a historian. While her personal life may not directly relate to her scientific achievements, it shows her ability to balance different aspects of her life.

There is much in Hodgkin's life that is interesting to everyone, but it is also important to recognize her scientific contributions. Scientific inquiry was her passion, as it must be for any successful scientist. The challenge for biographers is to convey this passion. Most readers may not have the scientific background to understand complex ideas without detailed explanations. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that educated people, who would feel embarrassed not to recognize a famous literary or artistic figure, often remain unaware of the rich legacy of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Farmers whose wells have dried up are increasingly seeking her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she relies only on her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to locate water, minerals, and lost items underground is known as dowsing. There are many theories about how dowsing works, ranging from scientific ideas like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One of the most believable theories suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. It is thought that dowsers can sense these vibrations while standing on the ground. Some dowsers claim they can ""feel"" water, while others say they can ""smell"" it, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years, due to droughts, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns that have become holiday homes, where running water pipes over long distances is too expensive. There are also golf course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret typically looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She emphasizes that wells cannot be drilled where there is a risk of contamination from waste. The water she finds is usually in cracks in solid rock, and if it is brought up properly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, where they work, there are many minerals, so they must be careful about iron in the water. 

Another important factor is electricity to power the pump. It is costly to run electricity over long distances, so it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. Once she considers all these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. 

For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. It will swing when she is above a water source. After identifying possible locations on the map, she walks over the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. 

""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret's husband also dowse the same area. Usually, but not always, they agree on the exact drilling spot. If they disagree, they will not drill until they find a consensus.

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in her unique skill; many anthropologists and writers have been intrigued by this mysterious intuition. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard to understand how her family could continue to thrive in their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be exciting to try something completely different. We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, 23, is a young mother with two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, 30, who works as a waitress in a fancy London restaurant. 

Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and crowded, which was very different from her hometown. She felt nervous about her new job. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when Amanda tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and reassured her that everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line of customers was waiting outside, and Amanda felt even more anxious. Luckily, the ordering system was automated, so she didn’t have to memorize everything. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she struggled to hear customers over the loud music. She often had to ask them to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and just wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, which surprised Amanda. She realized that waitressing is much harder than she thought. She used to think it was an easy job, but it actually requires a lot of energy and a friendly attitude, especially during busy times. Amanda felt relieved to return to her children, as being a mother seemed much easier after her day as a waitress.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy, who is 30, was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She had heard that Amanda's daughters could be a handful, but she thought she could manage. 

After Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have some quiet time. But she was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded her that she still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry. 

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. When she brought Sophie home from school, things got chaotic. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and played a loud game. Cindy thought they would tire out soon, but they didn’t. She tried to get them to take a nap by 8 pm, but then the girls kept asking for water, just to come downstairs and watch TV. 

Cindy realized that taking care of two small children was very tiring. There was no time for herself, and the responsibility felt overwhelming. However, she enjoyed the day overall.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, 30, a primary school teacher. 

On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt like a treat! She was unsure how to dress for school, wanting to look appropriate instead of in her farm clothes. 

At school, she faced about 400 students during assembly and hoped she wouldn’t stand out. In math class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from her own school experience. She also helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. 

After lunch, she attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. The day included a silent reading lesson and a fun French lesson where the children practiced speaking with her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, Rosemary was exhausted, while the children still had lots of energy. Speaking in front of the class was the hardest part for her. Although teachers have more holidays, she decided she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at Rosemary's farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had already been working for three hours! Rosemary's farm is large, with many cows and sheep. 

Hilary spent most of the morning in the ice-cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice cream. She had to resist the temptation to taste everything! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are not checked regularly, they can die, which is especially difficult in winter. 

After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! Hilary found the day lonely and missed being around children, as animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of farming is that there is no time off; cows need to be milked twice daily, making it hard to plan vacations. Although farming seems romantic, the reality is quite different. The income can be unstable, and Hilary wouldn’t want to rely on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many successful musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces. When you meet him, he looks youthful and has a bright personality, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s top concert halls, and a television feature was made about his work, filmed in both London and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo and began his musical journey with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but enjoyed Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother arranged for him to take lessons from the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, someone who was passionate about the trumpet and always looking for ways to improve.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to create a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them. From the start, he had a talent for finding the right balance and forming a connection with the instrument. He notes that even as a child, his unique sound was already noticeable, which was the first thing he developed.

Unlike John Wallace, a prominent British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. His parents supported his ambition to pursue a career in trumpet playing and provided him with opportunities to practice. At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson suggested America, it was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud discouraged him from joining an orchestra, saying that playing in one is like doing hard labor.

Hardenberger was aware that he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience. Thibaud encouraged him to participate for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but advanced to the second round, where he was familiar with most of the pieces. However, in the final round, he faced a concerto that intimidated him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even though he felt he played poorly, people were still listening.

Hardenberger's honest view of his work might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift of communication, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. He feels that the true power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**New In Paperback**

A. The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insights. It is a challenging but rewarding read.

B. Harriet is a composed middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three.

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7:00 am, and arrive at work by 8:00 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries last about three hours, but some can take all day. There have been times when I’ve worked for ten hours straight without a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about my next day’s work. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it is incredibly rewarding, even if there are failures. From 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain the surgeries to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them, but time pressure can make it hard to comfort them if they get upset. I usually leave work between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm. I am on call some nights and weekends, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I often worry about my patients for the first few days and sometimes dream about operating.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. I work in a team of three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My work is mostly about production, with only 10-15% being actual design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, and deadlines are always tight. Lunch is at 1:00 pm for an hour, and we often go to a pub. If the client is happy with my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be much later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7:00 am, but on some days, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5:00 am for long-haul flights. At around 10:30 or 11:00 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to be careful about my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. Clients often ask for recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which allows me to plan my routes. While most passengers are polite, some can be rude. However, I have built good relationships with my regular clients. I sometimes hear private conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11:00 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7:00 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we have designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11:00 am, we take a break for a big breakfast at a local café. In summer, I might work until 10:00 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually schedule a consultation in the evening. We focus on using old materials to create gardens that look historic. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren’t great, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we’ve designed bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone ringing. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day.""

**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. As the assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety guidelines while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6:00 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. Lunch is typically from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we monitor the contractors' work, it can create tension, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but I act quickly if something urgent arises. I usually leave the site around 6:00 pm and am on call all the time."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and reach the office by 7:30 am. My job involves managing customer development programs for our credit card users. I am responsible for launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I need to stay in touch with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I oversee advertising for the membership program across Europe, which means I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to address any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by reviewing the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these represent people's hard work, so I try to provide helpful feedback. I can tell if the sound fits our record label. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, selecting songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also communicate my vision for the album to the marketing team. I manage budgets and expenses as well. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm, and most evenings I attend concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new bands in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule to see if we have any client meetings that day. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and love making sales, knowing the furniture will go to a good home. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, sourcing them from auctions, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with our full-time restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while enjoying coffee to stay updated on the industry, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle the accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I leave work at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax after work.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am and start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over from the night shift. I work at one of four control positions in the tower, rotating every hour and a half. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic regulations between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. This job is quite stressful, and I take sick days seriously if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. My first task is to start the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is watching the register and coordinate lunch breaks for staff. In the morning, I assist customers in finding and ordering books. I enjoy helping customers, although it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers' representatives visit, and I discuss upcoming titles with them. I need to estimate how many copies of a new title we might sell and ensure timely delivery. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work a late shift, during which I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. My job is to assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, warning clients about potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly to gather information. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, but it can be hard to relax, and I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others, brings about change, and guides people towards a common goal. Leadership is not about physical traits like height, nor is it just about being smart. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is crucial, and a good leader should express it clearly and confidently. Dixon emphasizes the importance of saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Recognizing Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

**C. Comparing Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? A good leader motivates and supports you, while a bad leader makes you feel unimportant and blames you when things go wrong. The first one leads well; the second one just manages poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers prefer to work within set limits, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, states that a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to consider:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and act on them when you feel inspired.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is valuable, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, take the lead instead, and see how it changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

**F. Developing Leadership Skills**  
- Leadership doesn’t just happen; it develops through taking charge, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will be immediately accepted. It might even push people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your input is essential and how you can help others become leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created this tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly banter and brave attitude of foreman Bud and his team remind us of similar heroes in films by Howard Hawks. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development are lacking. Despite the skill in filmmaking, the story feels like typical B-movie material.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different perspective compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's film is more traditional, focusing on a single soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially in a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife, which is portrayed more harshly than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
This entertaining swashbuckler, loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, stands out among musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a cunning villain who secretly causes chaos. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for a fun film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama clichés with such humor and charm that it doesn’t feel like a problem.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film tells a serious story but looks overly detailed, resembling a museum exhibit. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is harsh when evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the plot, but the filmmakers focus too much on historical details, neglecting the dark and powerful story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill, especially in sound editing, where every sound is clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever there is a quiet moment, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
Promoted as featuring ""forty-eight international stars,"" this three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck has four directors and 23,000 extras, making it feel overly complicated. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news about the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is an impressive logistical achievement, it is best experienced on the big screen. Watching it on video diminishes the experience."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is truly engaging. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He unexpectedly has to defend his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the very end, and there is a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a strong debut in a popular genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a bang and follows the charming Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church intrigue, and serious murder, but we are confident he will uncover the guilty parties. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who finds herself in a unique position to investigate when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing criticism and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, Leah is brave and resourceful, making her a compelling character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, who helps his friend Hawk remove drug dealers from a troubled neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is quick and sharp, and while there are fewer deaths than usual, the story includes more philosophical themes. As always, Parker delivers high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, as they investigate a burglary and attack at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's straightforward writing style and keen observation of unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by the husband-and-wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book skillfully combines elements of romance, money, and violence to create a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher as the intended victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels that this is not the right direction for his career. While Simon Shaw usually entertains, this shift from dark comedy to farce does not quite meet his usual high standards.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best work in a while. It follows Canadian police as they search for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow and skillful build-up of tension, along with the portrayal of the intelligent but troubled robber, elevates this story above the typical detective novel."
CAE_57,"I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this leap. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. I have traveled before; after university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened—I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 

Now, I have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m no longer in a relationship and don’t have strong career ambitions. I feel I should make the most of this freedom, if only for my friends’ sake! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the necessary arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” 

Letting go of emotional ties makes it even harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their established lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says there is a growing realization that adventure is available: “People who always say, ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are realizing they can have it anytime they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.”

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up the career ladder and will return to the same position, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!” 

For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was a time of change. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to break free from that to live a normal life as a civilian.” While there are many reasons for traveling at this age, some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today’s workforce is more flexible. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Larger companies are even creating career-break policies, knowing that if they invest in training someone, it’s good to have them return rather than go to a competitor.

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that publishes stories of ordinary travelers, notes that more thirty-somethings are reassessing their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job—and many people aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now realize that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t for life anymore. Travel allows you to step back and think about your life.” 

Is giving in to wanderlust just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about just paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he’s running away. “It’s more about running towards something. I want to grab the things I desire.” However, he does feel some anxiety. “I’ll miss my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ‘hi’ to everyone, and having my morning coffee.” 

I share Ben’s concerns about leaving behind a structured life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, “This is common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel.” It may have taken a nudge to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll take pride in having embraced life. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the changes in technology. In this passage, she shares how she turned her home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that if I wanted to restart my journalism career, I needed to act fast. I felt like my skills were outdated, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were the norm. I worried that no one would trust me to use a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I would have a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was known in my family as the technophobe; even basic calculators confused me, and I still couldn’t figure out how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

My children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous, fearing I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn’t very skilled, I learned the basics. It turned out to be logical and straightforward. With practice, I improved a little each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk has always been a chaotic mess, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. For a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask for information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are downsides to working from home. I can feel isolated without physical contact with others. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the kids are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, many people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment, but also for the convenience of avoiding daily commutes to the city.

As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless in this digital age."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are the exhibits just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You can't miss the new Museum of Scotland, located at the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh. It features a large yellow sandstone tower and unique, wedge-shaped buildings topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more critical. Now, as the inside prepares for opening, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.

Forget debates about whether the museum tells a national story or follows a timeline. The answer is yes; it presents a rich collection of stories linked to important historical objects. There is a timeline to help visitors navigate, but it does not restrict the displays. The museum does not let its national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and Holyrood chapel silver, be overshadowed by national pride.

The main concern is whether visitors will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that a visit should be enjoyable and visually appealing, aimed at those with little prior knowledge. Despite this openness, Clarke insists on showing only what experts know. He avoids displays that rely heavily on imagination, as he believes they misrepresent the past. The public deserves the truth.

The challenge for visitors is whether the stories of the objects can be told effectively using explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, with only about 30 computers available in the museum. With less than three days before the opening, it is still uncertain. However, some aspects are clear, such as the stunning views of Edinburgh Castle. 

Inside, visitors will notice a series of interconnected galleries of various sizes and shapes, with pale walls designed to resemble large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light pours in through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space to appreciate each exhibit.

Thanks to a 12-member Junior board made up of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum includes a Discovery Centre. The group wanted to create an interactive experience, and while they didn't achieve that, they did secure a dedicated hands-on area for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition gallery. As a result, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, featuring a mix of items chosen by Scottish people that have significantly impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is fun, it feels somewhat trivial and does not fully address serious topics. However, it may become more meaningful when the computerized collection of personal stories goes live next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke is correct in saying that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it works well from the inside and the top, but whether it fits the location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"**The Future of Print Media: A Slow Change**

Peter Preston discusses the idea of ""transition,"" which means moving from one state to another. While change can be scary for some, it usually happens gradually. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe this change is inevitable because print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, major newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, while their online traffic continues to grow.

Yet, there are some surprising facts. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies daily. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. Interestingly, news and current affairs magazines, which many think would struggle in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend is seen in the book industry. E-readers like Kindle are very popular, with sales rising significantly. However, when booksellers looked at the sales of physical books over the past six months, they found only a slight decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that both digital and print formats can coexist.

The idea that young people are completely abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries also show different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

These varying trends indicate that the situation is more complex than many believe. In the past, analysts thought that rising online advertising would support the transition to digital newspapers. However, digital ad revenues are now falling, and many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The most effective way to attract paying readers seems to be offering a package that includes both print and digital access. This means that print newspapers still play an important role in selling online subscriptions, as their advertising rates are much higher than those for online ads.

Maintaining both a print edition and a website is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print media still holds significant visibility, and being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most fascinating subjects to photograph. A picture that includes a person is usually more interesting than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes change how people behave.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Instead, ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious you are. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A picture can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to maintain eye contact for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to capture a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it gives the viewer a sense of observing a moment. Candid shots are often very engaging, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be striking, the background can add context and interest. When including a background, avoid distracting details and focus on what is relevant. Ensure the subject stands out against the background, perhaps by using a wide-angle lens.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people interact—like talking, laughing, or working together—can lead to great photos. Couples, parents with children, and teams are all good subjects. Look for moments of connection, such as eye contact or physical gestures.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. An elevated camera position can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed photo against a nice background is good. However, family pictures can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, creating lasting memories."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing a different reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her unique approach to art.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work unless asked, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work,"" she says. Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting magazine interview. ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" she admits, and she looks shocked when asked if she minds being photographed.

After a short time, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and engaging conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, following two years of intense drawing at art school, a degree in graphic illustration, and work at a publishing house. However, she found illustration unfulfilling and began working with a well-known decorator, Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil piece, and that sparked her passion. ""Suddenly my interest got channelled,"" she explains. She decided to start her own business, unsure of where it would lead but feeling it was the right choice.

Sarah's keen observation skills and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil art. She often gets asked where to learn this technique, but she believes it cannot be taught. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she insists. She humbly claims she is still learning, stating, ""The moment you think you've mastered a field, you might as well give up.""

She is also honest about her weaknesses, like her inability to paint bread convincingly. When faced with a large project for a chapel ceiling, she struggled with the measurements and questioned her abilities. ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" she thought. This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work in a detached way, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it; she did.'""

Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art stands out from others, especially since the style has become popular again, but not always successfully. She has completed many significant projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to two more rooms.

However, trompe-l'oeil art has a challenge: once people understand the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this well. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it has to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold your attention and engage your imagination. That is the most important part.""

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil should also be personal to the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she emphasizes the importance of listening and understanding their vision. Many clients become friends, especially since she often works closely with them on-site. 

Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which keeps her busy, despite her modesty. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" While this may be true, it is hard to become bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves more recognition, and I am willing to promote it, even if she might not like it."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the important 'people skills' needed to succeed in your career.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now evaluated not only on our intelligence and training but also on how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is increasingly used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who is likely to excel and who may not. These skills are important for our future job prospects, regardless of our current field. The ability to perform well in exams is becoming less relevant. The new focus assumes we all have the necessary knowledge and skills for our jobs. Instead, it emphasizes social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—collectively known as emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For years, these qualities have been referred to by various names, such as 'character' and 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and those of others, using emotions to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people mistakenly think it just means being nice. However, it can also involve being direct and honest when necessary. Emotional intelligence is about managing feelings so they are expressed appropriately, allowing people to work together effectively towards common goals.

C. More businesses recognize that promoting emotional intelligence is vital for good management. The more complex a job is, the more important emotional intelligence becomes. A lack of these skills can limit a person's ability to use their technical knowledge effectively. While some individuals have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that foster teamwork gain a competitive advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer focus are essential, emotional intelligence is crucial for success in every job around the world.

D. Unlike IQ, which remains stable, emotional intelligence can grow throughout our lives as we learn from experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and developing empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and add them to our toolkit for success, especially in a time when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, nor does it ensure greater market success. However, if we ignore the human aspect, nothing else will work as effectively."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media profit from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has truly changed citizen photography. As news often breaks on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms for images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there are guidelines stating that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, highlighting the significant role of UGC in the future of media. However, to maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that individuals are fairly compensated for their work and that permission is always obtained.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old and comes from traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, physical manipulation, and exercise. While acupuncture can treat many health issues, it is most recognized in the West for its ability to relieve pain. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for this purpose.

**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**

Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that deliver Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weakened, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a consultation, an acupuncturist will assess where the imbalances in Qi are by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and looking at your overall health. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. Acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin, and they may also apply heat from burning herbs or pressure on specific points to help Qi flow.

**Acupuncture Points**

The acupuncture points are connected to the meridians and may not be located near the area of pain. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists believe this sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less frequently.

**Scientific Understanding**

While Western doctors do not fully accept the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, they recognize that acupuncture can help relieve pain. Scientific explanations suggest that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some researchers believe that acupuncture points can trigger the release of natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body, known as endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Many people with chronic pain turn to acupuncture as a last option. Commonly treated conditions include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Use of Acupuncture**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over two thousand years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some doctors outside China of its effectiveness. Today, acupuncture is used in various surgeries in China, from tonsillectomies to heart surgeries. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or alongside medications. While some patients report significant pain relief, experiences can vary. Many people may find the idea of being awake during surgery unappealing, but acupuncturists argue that acupuncture anesthesia has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia and allows for quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**

Like many alternative therapies, it is challenging to conduct clinical trials on acupuncture. However, studies have shown that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally report similar success rates. They acknowledge that acupuncture may not work for everyone and that individual responses can vary. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that for chronic pain, patients usually need six to seven sessions to feel significant relief, although some improvement may be noticed after just two or three visits.

**A Holistic Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, meaning they consider the whole person rather than just specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues with Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect pain, such as weather conditions and the nature of the pain (sharp, dull, throbbing, etc.). These factors are important in determining how acupuncture can help. Most conventional doctors may not consider these aspects.

**Traditional vs. Scientific Approaches**

Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that applying traditional Chinese medicine is essential for achieving deep healing and long-lasting results, which can be hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she carries herself with quiet confidence. One can easily imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she had not chosen to write detective stories filled with unexpected twists. However, it quickly becomes clear that her confident demeanor is a cover for her shyness. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh prefers to solve crimes alone, just like James does. She needs time alone to write and can do so anywhere as long as she has complete privacy.

Despite her success, she is too humble to agree that she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, even though millions read her twelve major detective novels worldwide. She admires the work of her close friend Ruth Rendell, especially her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. The books she enjoys most are often by female authors like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers some of the greatest novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up mainly in Cambridge after her family moved there when she was 11. She met her husband, a university student, in Cambridge, which is why she chose it as the setting for her book An Unsuitable Job For A Woman. She shares that her life has had its challenges, including the struggles she faced when her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill. To support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane, she worked long hours. Although she had many ideas for stories, she had little time to write. Thankfully, her husband’s parents helped care for her daughters during those tough years.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but it was not death itself that inspired her writing. Instead, she was drawn to the structure and creativity involved in writing crime novels. She has always loved reading detective stories and knew she wanted to be a writer.

James did not want to write about her own traumatic experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a great way to learn the craft of serious novel writing while keeping a distance from her own life. Over time, she realized that it was possible to follow the traditional format of a detective story and still create a meaningful novel about human nature. She believes that writing detective stories helps bring order to chaos and that solving a crime affirms the value of life, even if that life is difficult to love. She acknowledges that no one truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can significantly influence whether you are considered suitable for the position. Handwriting analysis, known as graphology, is recognized as a legitimate science in many places. Researchers suggest it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can also reveal emotional and psychological states. 

Graphology is increasingly used for career guidance and as a supplement to job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the effectiveness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes it deserves more attention. She argues that handwriting can reflect psychological traits and some medical conditions. 

Marne states, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help assess a person's mental abilities, whether they should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a manipulative or open personality."" She claims that graphology can be particularly useful in identifying potential criminal behavior. According to her, ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped and sometimes illiterate. Many come from difficult backgrounds and show signs of emotional development issues, which can appear as childish handwriting or repeated letters.""

Marne explains that handwriting can reveal a lot about a person. For example, she can determine if someone is honest or manipulative. She notes that young male offenders often have tall letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can also predict if someone is under extreme stress or has violent tendencies. Handwriting can even indicate potential suicidal thoughts. 

She adds that heart and lung issues can sometimes be detected through handwriting. ""You cannot diagnose a condition from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. However, if the handwriting changes over time or becomes disjointed, it may indicate a serious issue,"" she explains. A significant emotional upset can also temporarily alter a person's signature.

Marne describes how different handwriting styles can reveal psychological traits. For instance, people whose letters connect in a thread-like manner may be clever but deceptive. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting shows confidence and creativity, while disconnected writing often indicates loneliness. Small signatures can reflect feelings of inferiority, and circles over the letter ""i"" may indicate a desire for attention.

Marne believes that it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific discipline, and she is optimistic that this will happen soon. ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can reveal a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite these interesting claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the writing style taught, and that it does not have any deeper significance."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and comfortable chairs are essential for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a recent survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very basic; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly onto the street. It’s surprising that this space works, but the small, energetic team seems to be happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to how they would at home. This might be the key: the seven-person team has created a comfortable, home-like environment without unnecessary rules.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and creates poor working postures. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff have a varied work schedule that they control, which includes office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety helps reduce fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Employees enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They feel the office is ""just the right size""—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, yet large enough to focus on individual tasks. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, partly due to a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has already hired an ergonomist, which is not surprising. The chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The space is adequate, but the layout could be better. However, the environment feels impersonal and dull, with plain grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by arranging desks to make sharing information easier and displaying success stories or project updates on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office receives mixed reviews from employees. It feels like being in a glass case, surrounded by many similar spaces. Despite having both smokers and non-smokers in a small area, the air quality is surprisingly good.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is very standard and uninspiring. The desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet ergonomic standards, but this is a choice made by users. Computer screens are often placed on low desks, which is not suitable for modern equipment.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. There are many awards displayed, but the wood paneling and brown carpet create a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. The office is busy and active.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** There is not much positive to say about this office. The air conditioning is poorly controlled, leading to uncomfortable temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have too little desk space. It is very dusty, with many places for dust to collect, and the roof collects dust that falls on those below.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture looks more suitable for a workshop than a modern office. Many chairs are not helpful for people using computers, especially those shorter than 1.75 meters. Most chairs are old, lack proper adjustments, and have armrests that make it hard to get close to the desk.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement—cleaning is needed, individual achievements should be recognized more, and the air conditioning must be fixed, especially with so many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, accessible to everyone, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks of it every day. This ancient practice has turned into a big business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most chewing gum is made from synthetic materials, including pine resins and softeners that help maintain flavor and improve texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece especially liked mastic gum for cleaning their teeth and freshening their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, marking the beginning of commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic, leading to the growth of a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the demand for chewing gum increased, synthetic alternatives were developed.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, live a difficult and dangerous life. They trek for miles to collect sap from scattered sapodilla trees in very humid conditions. The environment is harsh, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One particularly troublesome insect, the chicle fly, lays its eggs in the ears and noses of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros can climb a mature tree quickly to cut the bark and collect the sap in a bag below. They then carry the liquid back to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is formed into bricks.

Life at the camp is also tough, with a boring and often inadequate diet based mainly on maize, accompanied by a local alcohol made from sugar cane. Despite these challenges, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.

As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. They claim that chewing gum helps you relax, boosts your energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were regularly given gum. One of the main benefits of gum is that it can help reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid forms when we eat, but our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides important minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva production.

Research continues on new textures and flavors for gum. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to create the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."
CAE_17,"**REMOTE HOTELS**

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the peacefulness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The hotel has basic facilities, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I discovered it by chance while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we had to walk down. When we reached the bottom, I was amazed to find this hotel in a stunningly beautiful and remote area. After a tiring climb, it was incredible to relax in luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter music.

**C. MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. Although the hotel is large and offers many free water sports, you can easily find solitude on its nine kilometers of private beach. Just swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, and you will hardly see the hotel among the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the peacefulness as the sun sets.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most stunning views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and located at an altitude of 1,000 feet, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel features colonial-style furniture made of mahogany and greenheart wood, and has four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is a perfect escape from the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very picturesque. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages, and beautiful wooden buildings from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel, made of wood and painted white with red domes, is inspired by a historic hotel on the French Riviera. Although it is a bit worn down now, it still retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau surrounded by a moat with two swans. This chateau, which was a family home until recently, has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, along with complimentary champagne from their own brand.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel that is not overly luxurious. It is a popular stop for travelers recovering from safaris and planning their next adventures. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and inviting rooms, and decide to stay longer. There are even apartments for those who want to settle in for a few months. The hotel is set on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, making it a great place to enjoy the stunning African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Hotel Splendido was first signed into by the Duke of Windsor, and since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet wealthy guests, but this former monastery turned villa still offers a splendid experience. The restaurant serves delicious, simple food, and the hotel features beautiful Persian rugs and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"The Hotel Inspector, Sue Brown, evaluates hotels as her job. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection. Just one minute into the annual check, problems are already appearing at the Globe Hotel, although the staff are unaware of it. The receptionist is busy giving room rates over the phone to a potential guest and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake during the arrival phase, which Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't just any three-star hotel,"" she argues. ""It has three red stars, and I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 listed in the guide from her organization.

Before they even receive a cold welcome, the atmosphere feels off. Access from the car park is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor to the hotel entrance. ""Again, not what I expected,"" Sue comments. Could it get worse? Yes, it can. The receptionist cheerfully informs them, ""We seem to have no record of your booking."" It turns out that out of the hotel's 15 rooms, 12 are empty that night. One room is on the top floor, but it does not meet Sue's standards: it feels stuffy, and there is a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

When Sue started her career, she earned a reputation for being tough. ""I was known as 'The Woman in Black,'"" she remembers, ""which is funny because I never wore black. And I’ve never been too tough."" However, the next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. His face shows fear. Before she says anything, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think there’s a blocked drain,"" he sighs. ""The whole floor might need to be replaced.""

Sue kindly suggests that, in addition to fixing the plumbing, he should instruct his staff to be more careful about showing guests to the lounge. ""It might be better to guide them to the other lounge,"" she advises. Greaves nods sadly and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback is meant to help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who provided information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the standards to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, encouraging Greaves to ask, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue’s response is, ""Don’t serve a dessert that collapses."" Greaves’ brief excitement fades.

Sue’s job is to express the complaints that many customers are too afraid to voice. ""Sometimes, it can be very sensitive. I remember a woman called to complain that I got her son fired. All I could say was the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers."" She often receives letters with false accusations, from being arrogant to demanding bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says.

Sue must not only share her findings verbally with the hotel manager but also send a detailed written report. After all, the hotels pay for her advice (there is an annual fee to be included in the guide). However, being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. It is good news for Greaves to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to ensure that everything has been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves smiles, though it seems unconvincing. ""We’ll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,"**Seven Summits: A Mountaineer's Journey**

Doug Scott, an experienced mountaineer, shares his incredible experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While climbing Mt. Everest, Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit. Dougal started discussing sleeping bags with their Equipment Officer, Dave Clark, even though only they were there. Doug thought this was odd, possibly due to low oxygen levels. He even found himself talking to his own feet, which were getting cold. They were not just worried about survival but also about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug reflected on their time on the summit ridge and felt grateful to have Dougal with him, as he inspired confidence. Doug focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is known as one of the most dangerous mountains. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized how challenging their climb would be. They followed a route established in 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a first for this area. After facing tough conditions, including a wet sleeping bag and strong winds, they finally reached the summit and celebrated their success.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the dense jungle on the lower slopes, which was concerning because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found a trail marked by arrows and some litter, leading them to a rock pool. They attempted a challenging climb but decided to take a safer route to reach the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Aconcagua. They met a fellow climber, Phil Erscheler, who invited them to join his group on a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they set off. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to take the standard route instead. They faced strong winds but successfully reached the summit and camped nearby. At base camp, they met climbers from the Jakarta Mountaineering Club, who encouraged Doug to pursue the Seven Summits goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug realized that climbing Vinson Massif could be possible if he guided enough people to cover the costs. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never set, creating a unique atmosphere. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg and traveled to Elbrus. They faced some challenges with local regulations but eventually began their ascent. After acclimatizing, they took a cable car to a high point and then walked to a refuge. On their climb, they encountered strong winds and icy slopes. They thought they had reached the summit but discovered there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz Pyramid, Doug and his team aimed to create a new route and connect with the local Dani people. They were warned about potential dangers but decided to proceed. On May 12, they began climbing, and the weather improved. Doug and his team reached the summit by 11 am, and he received a warm welcome for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"
FCE_15,"**Style Merchants**

Style influences many aspects of our lives today, from clothing to home decor and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest trends for fashion enthusiasts this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the overly frilly style, suggesting simpler designs instead. Ingham has been sketching and designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he attended fashion school, where he learned how to cut and make clothes. However, you don’t need to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, Ingham offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, a staple in women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail previously worked for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery design. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990, and now her pieces are popular among many celebrities. Her unique style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has begun using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Just four years after starting her career in the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson has had two of her designs chosen for a major exhibition, despite only taking an introductory art and design course. Her handbags are always noticed, as they are handmade in the UK and exude glamour, whether made from luxurious calfskin or rich silk. A Grimson bag is not just a bag; it combines style and quality, making it truly special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He understands that most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His unique approach ensures that clients don’t look like they just left a salon. However, this casual style comes at a price—£250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Leveraging his fame, Peter has created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who can’t visit his salon to achieve their desired looks at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and works as a consultant for a large supermarket chain, providing floral ideas for top restaurants. Remarkably, she has no formal qualifications in floristry and left her teaching job ten years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern and simple floral arrangements have won numerous design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also enjoyed successful lecture tours in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements today should be simple yet striking, with fewer large leaves. For wedding bouquets, she emphasizes that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses and took nearly two years of work. This approach allowed the hotel to install advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to keep track of their preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time because of its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's clientele, making up about 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with a business center that includes three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables and renting televisions and DVD recorders, allowing for easy upgrades.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished rooms that are inviting and cozy. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion is exceptional, thanks to Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who moved his two-Michelin-star restaurant to the hotel. This move has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant adds value without financial risk. With its combination of technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_24,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to create detailed studies of individual plants instead of painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting gradually. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and you're so busy,"" she says. However, she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you might think they are dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in some flower shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they thrive just as well as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"**No Title**

Many trees in the Brackham area were destroyed during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these important trees completely changed the look of the town center, which upset many of the more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the worst of the storm, when the strong winds knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too ill to notice. He was a large and healthy man, but for the first time, he was seriously sick with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. Believing the police needed him, he ignored her advice and tried to keep working. This only made him forgetful and irritable. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor, and by then, he was too weak to argue. Soon after, she took him to the pharmacy for his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could hardly believe it. That evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then pulled the sheets over his head. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics started to work, that he got up and realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room forever. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It had been expensive, but Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The green garden had given them a sense of privacy. Now, however, the storm had changed everything. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree, which had not made the room dark because there was also a window on the opposite wall. The tree had created interesting patterns of light and shadow that hid the worn furniture they had brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room felt harshly bright, revealing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was not pleasant either. The tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, now loomed over them with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams' every move.

""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. ""That's what I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. That year, the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. The snow almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. However, in the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. The wind blew fiercely up there, but in our valley, we only felt sudden gusts; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not truly trouble us. The real threat was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently but now posed a danger. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by the dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow began to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These ominous grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and rising, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we focused on the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The melting snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and nearing a dangerous level. Then, it happened – for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a mini Niagara Falls as the water surged over the dam and rushed into the stream below. The river seemed furious as the water poured down towards its lower stretches. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream looked wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, angrily pushing against its banks. For three days, we prayed that it would stay below its limits. Luckily, our prayers were answered as the dam held strong and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the huge clouds above the valley and appreciate the great power of the river without fear. Thanks to the dam, we feel that our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing film articles for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviews of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but since Tom was not mainly a journalist, he was not very careful in choosing his team. 

Initially, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need special knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to make it more enjoyable. At that time, it felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. I even thought a millionaire was helping me personally and pretending to hire me because I lacked confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with my review, I felt embarrassed.

Tom's idea of a team of critics for the arts did not work out as planned. Although it was a good idea, we didn’t meet as expected, and everything was done over the phone. It also turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so I chose to write about films. Without Tom's initial support, we might not have developed the current system, where I write a detailed weekly piece about one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn’t have enjoyed the typical film critic role, which requires reviewing every new film. That routine would quickly make me feel bored. I would find myself sitting in a screening room on a Monday morning, sighing, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?""—a sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide.

The freedom I have allows me to expand my arguments or, during a dull week, to create something interesting from little material. But what is my role in the public eye? I believe people choose films based on stars, marketing, or the director. There is also loyalty to certain types of films. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a critic's opinion. So, if a film review isn’t really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel I need to be ""right"" about a movie. I also don’t think there should be a specific number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. My job is to present an argument. I’m not a judge, and I wouldn’t want to be one."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

A teenager who loves sports is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably a female. This is a chance to work with someone who could be an Olympic champion. The partner should be very interested in long-distance running (regular 15 km sessions), swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is a plus), and cycling (a love for 100 km rides is helpful). It is essential to be able to do all three activities without taking a break.

Triathlons are becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. They attract large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. While it may be exciting for spectators, what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, has not yet learned the common phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes use when asked about their motivations. She explains, ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike while still wet. Of course, you get cold. After the 40 km bike ride, you have to run 10 km, which feels long when you’re tired. But it’s really fun, and it’s all worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, but that was because she was the only junior participant. Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we found ourselves at the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried the whole time I was running."" However, she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would end, but I’m afraid that if I stop once, I might want to stop again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, while most people would step off when they realize they can’t go any further. She just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That’s why I’m working hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it’s a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, there is a cost to her dedication. Her intense training has made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she says. ""I’m not really into parties. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do keep in touch with the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times and achievements.""

Where will this strong focus lead Melanie? She has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" which involves swimming 750 meters, cycling 20 kilometers, and running 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher competitions than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I don’t have anyone my age to train with,"" she says. It’s interesting, isn’t it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember this: only collect items you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They were drawn to the shapes and colors of these stones, which represented their first efforts to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells simply for their beauty.

I have been collecting for my entire life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I was sent to a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by people from the past. I was fascinated by these items. 

Interestingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. Researchers believe that for some people, collecting is the only part of their lives where they feel they have complete control. For me, it is simply something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like coconut shell cups and carved ivory beads. Another notable collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected various items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, with great determination. 

I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a fire that destroyed my house. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, looking at the remains of my furniture and my collection, unsure which loss saddened me more.

I have always been intrigued by how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet adds value to the items traded in markets. As certain small objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now considered valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I, unfortunately, threw away both the boxes and the toys.)"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work**

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic in advance and talk to key people to understand the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and images to display. It’s important that the public understands the exhibition, so I plan interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents are needed for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, figuring out the best routes. They learn how to navigate one-way streets and make turns. I step in when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they prepare for the test, I give them a simple route but tell them they must take a different one because the road is closed. This forces them to think creatively about alternative routes.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and usually work from home. My job involves answering phone inquiries, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about marine life. I take them out to sea to help them understand the underwater environment better, which often changes their perspectives. I feel fortunate because conservation is my passion, but since I work for a charity, I constantly seek funding, which limits what I can achieve.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite diverse. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and that we keep around 300 copies of our books in stock. We maintain high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with my co-publishers. I enjoy working with a passionate team, but like many jobs, there is too much administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**No Title**

Every June, we traveled to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did so very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not a good experience because the food was terrible.

The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We always think it’s a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms we would stay in. Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when few people visit Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of small details like that, while her husband handles repairs and redecorating.

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling widely, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel like we were more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that the others felt our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was perfect.

Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey.

In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other guests at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."
FCE_67,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never finished, as Sarah Sutherland-Pilch explains to Veronica Lee. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. Known as Pilch, she works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University, where she studied French and History of Art. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can accommodate up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she considers the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can be on the slopes until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower first, but she avoids sleeping. ""It's not good if you do,"" she warns. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she says. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful. Breakfast this morning was great fun, but some weeks don’t go as well for various reasons.""

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. ""We often start at Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar,"" she explains. However, she doesn’t stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""when you definitely don’t want to cook breakfast with a bad headache.""

On Sundays, work starts earlier than usual because breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We just blitz the place—clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready."" If she hasn’t done the shopping for the week on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests seem confused and have many questions. ""I think the mountain air affects them,"" she jokes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she admits."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory wearing overalls and large shoes, with messy hair framing her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

Several times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie had been fascinated by the steam-heated brass hands used to shape the gloves, which she called ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" she said. 

""You should visit one if you want to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. They are basic places. The technology has improved, but it’s not very different from what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s tough work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; they’ve found 6,000-year-old tanning artifacts in Turkey. The first clothing was just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is a leather expert; you should talk to him. If you start a conversation about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers are passionate about their work. 

""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" he asked. 

""I can't say I have,"" she replied. 

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" 

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" 

He laughed at her answer. She was innocent and eager to learn, reminding him of Marie, who was much taller than Rita but shared her good-natured intelligence. 

""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will take you through the entire glove-making process. Come on! We’re going to make you a pair of gloves, and you’ll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""
FCE_71,"**Is It a Tough Job?** Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss. However, she has one small issue—she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so cramped with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London, handling routine tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning itineraries, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her working behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he prefers caddying, especially since golf is his passion. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, with average earnings between £25,000 and £35,000, much of which goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You're not just carrying bags; you're giving advice, using your knowledge, and trying to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, which made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies' scorecards, which are valuable to TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players themselves.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to taste food at the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend, who was an editor of a Saturday Review, offering him a food column. At that time, Martin was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. Having been a farmer, I knew about the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called *The Fox Busters*, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard at them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I'm not an early riser, though. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning—all with one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop, which I dislike. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but I now have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Surrounding it were large piles of soft sawdust, creating golden mounds that reached down to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too.

Still laughing, he watched as they hesitated on the roof, looking scared. One by one, they jumped down, relieved to land safely. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them suggested going back up to the roof to jump again. Although they were not very excited, they climbed back up and began jumping off in a determined way until only Michael was left. The others were down below, grinning and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?""

Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning foolishly, wondering why the jump had seemed easier the first time. For a while, they thought he was just joking, but then they noticed him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but when that didn’t work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Eventually, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn’t move, they began to get up and walk away, still teasing him.

""Who started this?"" he called after them. But he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He stayed there alone for nearly an hour while the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were damp from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone.

He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home in time for dinner by now. If you won't come home, you might as well stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a hint of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. Although she spoke firmly, Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the grinning faces below and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change their careers turn to a careers adviser. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. After this, you will receive a summary of the results, along with suggested careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest career advice organizations. Taking the careers test felt like being back in a science exam. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometric tests would accurately reflect who I am. The tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, although I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are relieved I didn’t become a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean a complete shift. Last March, after losing her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney sought help from Career Analysts. She said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to reflect on my career. I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But in the end, I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial responsibilities,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, she decided to use her existing skills and move into a field that suited her better than insurance. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she truly wanted to do. She has recommended the service to several friends, all of whom are satisfied.

Some people feel they would not have made significant changes without help. For example, 26-year-old Juliet Greene visited Career Counselling Services and made important life decisions. ""After working at a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I approached Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,"" she said. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which I found helpful because you forget much of what you say. After the fourth meeting, I carefully considered the test results and decided to study geology. I plan to start a degree in it later this year. I believe the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the cost. I feel much happier and more positive now.""

However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I felt lost. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either required a significant pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself. You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he examines their teeth. Jerome explains, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has worked to create a space where people feel comfortable. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable environment.

This approach may surprise many, as most people associate dental visits with discomfort or clinical settings. Jerome states, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his innovative relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the initial check-up, the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then, the headset switches to a special camera that gives the patient a visual tour of their mouth.""

Interestingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their dental visit. Another important aspect is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it has a pleasant orange scent. Jerome explains, ""When people enter, I want them to realize through all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make someone anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the top priority. For instance, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping, which can feel strange at first but is not painful if the patient is relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned is that when you make it easier for the patient, it also makes it easier for you,"" he explains. He believes his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it’s easy to see why. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which comes from South America, is now a huge global business worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, making it a popular time for chocolate sales. Only Christmas sees more chocolate consumption. Although large-scale chocolate production started in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. 

The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often incorrectly called cocoa beans, a mistake that dates back to the 17th century when they were also referred to as cacoa and cocao beans. The Aztecs even used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and served during ceremonies and to welcome guests.

The Spanish found the drink more enjoyable when mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to reach the rest of Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. However, in 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. 

The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids, leading to the creation of milk chocolate. At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. Then, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy image of milk from the English countryside, making it a strong competitor against rich French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain seems to have stabilized at about four bars per person each week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One recent strategy is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are transformed into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something different. 

On the other hand, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business because of this. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, remember the challenges faced by those who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master in his craft. He still has many interests, such as paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells. As he shows me around his apartment, he asks, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is definitely the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I’ve grown so fond of them. I never intended to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so more people could see my art. They even spoke to a gallery owner."" This led to a successful exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. Given the high prices of his work—around £2,000 for some ornaments—Cooke seems happy to part with them.

There are 86 pieces in this exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Cooke says he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else makes art like his, and as the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

Cooke wishes he had started this work earlier, as he feels he could have created even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels physically limited compared to when he began. However, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own techniques and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he explains. Yet, the detail, color variations, and symmetry in his work look very intentional.

Cooke's search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him beyond his local beaches in Norfolk to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of damaging the environment. ""When I collect shells, I hear people walking on them much faster than I can collect them. The ones left behind are broken by the sea. I would never take shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty he creates from the shells he finds."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old model who often travels to exciting places and appears on magazine covers. When she is not modeling, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

The receptionist at Kira's modeling agency told me, ""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late."" I thought, ""That's fine."" I had been trying to ignore the negative things I had read about models, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to mind. I wondered how late she would be—an hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she chose to go to the hairdresser instead of meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to talk. 

However, when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and accompanied by her mother. She was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, tall, and pretty girl. Kira explained that all models under 16 must bring an adult with them to work, and her mother, who looked proud of her daughter, was just a normal mum.

Kira seems a bit confused by her sudden fame, which is understandable since it was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should join,"" Kira recalled. ""I said no, but she sent some photos anyway."" When she learned she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected gave Kira the confidence to continue, and she performed well, winning easily. The Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Now, Kira finds it challenging to balance her two lives. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some unkind classmates make rude comments about her success, saying she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this difficult, especially since she is not self-important. She said, ""They think that because I became a model, I can't stay the same. The only thing that has changed is that I am more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The Select agency can call her at any time to offer a job for the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't promise to join them because I don't know my schedule. I can't make plans, and sometimes they get canceled, but my friends understand. They don’t complain that I’m always busy with modeling.""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career ahead of her, and not many people can say that before finishing their school exams. As I was about to end the interview with this remarkable girl, I asked what she would like to do if she didn't have her beauty. She paused and replied, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the warm lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are sure they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

They have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their journey began when Terence read about gold worth millions hidden in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the most promising land to explore. After clearing away plants and finding pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent the last ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. 

Now, they are running low on money. Having spent their savings on this dream, they need to convince an investor to put £50,000 into the project to dig a bit deeper to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, but we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys last week, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are right, it would bring more visitors here, but I hope millions of people don’t come and disturb the hillside if they find gold.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It’s adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I’ll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they cannot stand up or move freely, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey,"" she says.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She climbed in on the deck of a ship with an instructor, who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a multinational program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers,'"" she explains. This term refers to underwater volcanoes where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel recalls a frightening experience during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment with a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They looked at each other in silence, waiting for something to happen. When nothing did, they felt an incredible relief—they were still alive!

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD, and when I finally saw them in person, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with different train schedules, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I told myself as I returned home. I repeated this every year after. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month.

Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. Carrying all your belongings in a rucksack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail experience, where common sense can be forgotten along with your paperback and socks. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. A system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is quite special.

On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize how much we could do with this train ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling non-stop was too appealing; there was always another country just across the border, always somewhere further to explore. And the extra miles? They cost us nothing.

We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. We focused on the sights that were easiest to see. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to get by and enjoy ourselves, just like most other Inter-Railers who shared the train corridors, food, water, money, and music with us.

The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrived, and you could finally see it with your own tired eyes. Only by experiencing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it for yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be so dull. While the train journey may not reveal new things about the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail offers the best chance to appreciate this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in unsuitable clothing. Although airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, it is a common issue that regular travelers will eventually face. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and it is impossible for any airline to guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially if your journey involves changing planes.

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which is meant to give enough time for luggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to transfer between two flights, and these times are also extended to help with baggage transfers. Normally, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which can disrupt the baggage system. Human error or accidents, like a torn destination label, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. 

For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom transferred between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The risk of losing luggage during plane changes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when transatlantic passengers connect to flights in Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for your entire journey. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, muddy browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a peaceful atmosphere, just like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully through this setting, appearing like a flash of light. It is gone in an instant, but its image stays in your mind, powerful despite its small size.

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep feelings for this little bird are shown by his uncertainty about what exactly attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess that transformed into a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this tale. Although kingfishers have many shades of blue in their feathers, they do not actually contain blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers. Their vibrant colors, combined with the fact that these birds are shy but can be observed from a distance, create a perfect opportunity for photographers. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he draped over himself while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him another four years to capture his first good photograph. During this time, the European kingfisher became a major part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream rich with kingfishers, but school limited his time with the birds. He missed classes and considered himself an ""academic failure."" Nevertheless, his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, then became an assistant to the editor, and eventually worked as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, Charlie dreams of making the perfect kingfisher film: ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. He prefers a simple approach and enjoys photographing parts of the kingfisher's wings. His thoughts drift as he reflects on the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still captivate him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever reveal."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from New Conductors**

Giving directions to an orchestra is challenging. Anne Inglis interviews five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant and was later invited to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous; I always feel confident in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after two unsuccessful attempts. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have been forgotten."" The competition opened many doors for him, including a position as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being labeled as a competition winner: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired me after the competition, are inviting me back. If that stops, my career could suffer.""

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" says Kani, who began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size, unlike the larger conductors I had learned from before. This made a big difference."" Kani appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many conflicts, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says conducting surprised him but is very interesting. He started as a resident musician at an opera house and learned from great conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's *Agrippina* from the piano at a festival, which was a new experience for him. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I did my best to achieve that. Thankfully, people respect my overall musical ability. I learn from every experience, both in musical style and performance. Now, I am open to any opportunities to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and recommended him to his agent. Now 32, Marshall quickly found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to manage some relaxed professional musicians who were reading newspapers during the performance. ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best results. Many orchestral musicians I’ve seen don’t seem to need much guidance from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express what I want. If people see you’re anxious, it only gets worse. I haven’t studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are considering taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island might be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is also a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides, like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere and better scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were unsure what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings that he could see easily! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still felt there was more to explore. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, which looked like it would get you wet, but it didn’t. For younger children, Toy Land was a lot of fun. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they found out they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not boring. It was very clean, and the staff were excellent. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member kindly went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am quite timid, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over before we knew it! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it less exciting, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we definitely felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller coaster, the Rocket, stands out in the park, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We noticed that the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World, and we wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Since she had experience with computers, her husband suggested she start a design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. However, she was careful with her spending and kept the bank informed. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. Her business remains small, and most customers pick up their work directly.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum. After moving to the countryside, where such jobs were unavailable, she decided to start her own business. She creates a collection of 50 greetings cards that she sells to museums. Although she enjoys her independence, she finds it challenging to focus at home because there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She relies on word-of-mouth for business and does not advertise. Her prices are lower than those of other artists, which attracts customers from London. While she misses exchanging ideas with others, she believes the benefits of working alone outweigh the drawbacks.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. At one point, she managed six full-time workers, but due to an economic decline, she had to let them go, which was difficult because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and employs women who work from their homes. She must be ready to lower her prices when needed and explore new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the rural lifestyle. She enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants, but 80% of her income comes from international deals, which means she often takes calls at unusual hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to separate work from home life. Tessa publishes children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt isolated since all her professional experience was in London.

E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that earns £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. Requests from friends and family led her to send cakes across the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where all the baking is done, employing a baker and a cake decorator. Meg no longer bakes herself, as she manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as she started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is made up of talented musicians. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their father, John, makes musical instruments. 

In South Wales, schoolteachers John and Hetty Watkins wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, who was showing great talent. However, they found that cellos were very expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years. 

After trying to make violins and violas, John finally made his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers, ""It turned out really well. He made me another one later, and I used that one until a few months ago."" John has now retired from teaching and works full-time as a craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling one to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo was a special achievement for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano: ""As soon as I could climb up and bang the keys, I did,"" he recalls. Soon after, he was drawn to the cello. ""My parents wanted me to play the violin because Dad played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. I tried it for six weeks but didn’t enjoy it. I was inspired by the cellist in Dad's group, who I thought was really cool when I was six or seven. He offered to give me lessons, and that’s how I started.""

Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive but not pushy. I wouldn’t have responded well to pressure. Instead of feeling jealous of Paul’s success, I saw it as something to aspire to."" Huw is now making a name for himself as a pianist and composer.

Paul has achieved great success with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and, at just 20 years old, became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which he has on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 

""Dad hasn’t said anything about me moving on to a new cello,"" Paul shares. ""But he did play both cellos and admitted that my new one is quite nice! My dad's cello might need 50-100 years to develop the power to fill large concert halls like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.""

Soon, Paul will perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto, part of a new series called Masterworks. ""The history of the piece doesn’t change how I play it,"" he says. ""I will always play it my way."" However, Paul won’t be able to watch himself on TV because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will need to be organized and energetic to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. ""You are always interacting with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies,"" he explains. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden position, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. 

Gareth finds it useful to still farm with his parents, as it allows him to relate to farmers and understand their challenges. He also has the physical strength needed for the job, which includes tasks like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers, butterfly larvae, and birds' nests as a child and now realizes how farming has changed the countryside. He believes that farmers were just following government advice and that it is not their fault.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. However, now they are communicating and understanding each other's perspectives. ""We are at a turning point, and it only takes a small step to bring them together,"" he says. 

Gareth's work focuses on conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting and caring for trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My job is to ensure tasks are completed efficiently and with minimal fuss. I enjoy seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork,"" he shares. 

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys every moment, especially interacting with the public. However, he finds some visitors frustrating. ""Some people come in, demand everything, and leave as if they own the place. It can be annoying to stay polite with them!"" he admits. 

In the end, Gareth believes that common sense is key. If you have plenty of it and enjoy working outdoors, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just remember, there may not be a position available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket parking lot. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slowing down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra explained, ""My whole life is about being at my best for the Championships."" She is following a strict schedule to reach maximum fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, which will be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there is no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become more difficult and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose. But once the game is over, we become friends again.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It is essential for us to think and train like world-class players. As captain, I believe it is important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra mentioned, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned. I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their abilities. Some parents may not realize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help academically gifted children, musically talented kids often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is seen as less important.

Children who are musically gifted, or those whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, can benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established relatively recently. These schools create a supportive environment for children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend about one third to one half of their day on music-related activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program that focuses on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with smaller class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which allows them to spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some disadvantages. The cost is a significant issue, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 a year for boarders. Each school tries to help families with scholarships and financial aid for exceptionally talented children. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

Separating musically gifted children from a young age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide support when needed. 

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic focus, as many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met. Therefore, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before considering a specialist music education.

Students who are also academically gifted may thrive in a less specialized setting, such as a school with a strong music program, or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, along with orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to create detailed studies of individual plants instead of painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting gradually. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and it's a hectic time,"" she says. However, she finds beauty in the gradual decay of flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in some flower shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden features many plants from distant lands, which seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never finished, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch to Veronica Lee, as she balances making beds and cooking delicious meals. Sarah, 24, from West Sussex, is in her second year as a chalet girl. She works for a company in Val d'Isère, France, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she explains.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she admits is the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can be on the slopes until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, saying, ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful—breakfast this morning was great fun—but some weeks don’t go as well for various reasons.""

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. ""We often start at Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar,"" she shares. However, she doesn’t stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""when you really don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired.""

On Sundays, work starts earlier, with breakfast for guests served by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We just blitz the place—clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready."" If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. ""Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions. I think the mountain air affects them,"" she jokes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie, a zookeeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my outfit for Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around when I could have been quietly cuddling an animal. Some fashion team members seemed stressed, but my job is not very pressuring. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed at the thought that I would usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I find it interesting to see how magazines operate, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. They gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes in a cupboard. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a fantastic day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening program Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I enjoyed being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was a lot of fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the rest of the team. My idea of landscape gardening didn’t include hard physical work or careful planning. I’m more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so I don’t plan to quit my other job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medicine. I thought I would feel faint during some tasks, but I surprised myself by managing well. The friendship among the nurses was great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less meaningful compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn’t pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew about from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage them.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past some of the most beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning scenery.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with an aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey itself was wonderful, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There were no roads, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unpredictable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train finally arrived, it was a rush of people climbing into and onto the carriages, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains when they are young, but that’s not my story. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had carefully maintained. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Are you trying to get your work published? If you’re unsure where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" One important thing to remember is that you need to research your market and learn about publishers while also improving your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world. 

No matter what type of writing you do, it’s essential to know the markets you want to target. There are several ways to do this, but the best method is to read as much as you can about relevant topics. Visit your local library and explore nearby bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

As time goes on, you need to keep updating your knowledge because new publications are always appearing. Editors change jobs, and magazines can shift their focus. Publishers are always looking for new talent, so as writers, we must provide what they want. 

If you’re unsure about what to write, let’s say you want to write short love stories. The first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories, a limited market these days, and collect recent copies. Familiarize yourself with the types of stories they buy and pay attention to their readers' expectations. The editor’s goal is to meet the needs of their audience.

Writers often ask me, ""This has been rejected three times—am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone, but it’s likely that the work isn’t ready for publication. I try to give honest feedback while remaining positive. Many new writers are too eager to submit their work before they are truly ready. If you’ve only written one story or article, it’s very unlikely to be published. This rarely happens. When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have years of experience in publishing or journalism behind them.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, start writing more while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will improve your skills, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your confidence. Instead of discarding any of your work, focus on improving it. I also recommend not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before achieving success.

Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for creative writing courses in your area. If you can’t find one, consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible.'"

On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I had expected. The usual clean and bright atmosphere of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had left their bags all over the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers one by one. He looked well-off: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn’t mind talking to her myself. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

""Well, I’m going north,"" she replied. ""But to Philadelphia?"" 

""No, I’m going to New York, but I’ll be..."" 

""Thanks anyway,"" he said, moving on to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. ""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said she was going to Wilmington, he just walked on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up from my pillar and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform as if I was focused on the train. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn’t; I probably seemed unreliable to him. He glanced at me quickly and then turned to the other end of the waiting area. By now, he looked very stressed. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you’re going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five—older than me. She looked like a school teacher. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Then could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my left wrist (even though I didn’t own a watch). I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them like pets on leashes. 

Next, I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do."" The woman nodded sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet and waited to see where he was going with this. 

""So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" It sounded suspicious! Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? 

""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" This seemed like a weak excuse to me. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I glanced at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, shares his thoughts about his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef. John believes that everyone has a chance in life. For him, that chance was to run a restaurant, while Gary's chance was to cook. When John learned about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it. The place was in terrible condition, but it was just what he needed.

Starting this business reminded John of his childhood. He remembers feeling sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. This made him want to ensure his family had time together. His wife took care of their children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made it a point to have meals together. This focus on family helped their children, Gary and Joe, grow up confident. From a young age, they would talk to the restaurant's regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and accidentally knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to earn his pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he always had money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John enjoyed seeing Gary contribute.

Although Gary was not very good at school, he excelled in the kitchen. By the time he was 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John realized that Gary had a talent for catering. When Gary needed to do work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one goal at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you will catch neither."" John also told Gary that he needed to achieve his goals by the age of 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his tasks in less than an hour. He even helped his classmates. No one expected Gary's TV cooking show to become so successful, and John is very proud of him. He has always taught Gary that hard work is essential because nothing is given for free. Gary recognized the opportunity he had and took full advantage of it.

As parents, we hope our children listen to us as they grow up. If they remember even a small part of what we say, we should be grateful. John feels that Gary has listened and learned from him."
FCE_7,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult. The best way to find one is through personal connections. If you know someone who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if, like Jo, you have just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have those connections. You might have to stay in a hostel and search for a place. For Jo, Dublin felt like a big unknown. She felt nervous when she took the train to start her new job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave her small town. They all wanted to escape and experience life. Some of her classmates had moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm, as they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a week. However, Jo was unaware that they were still talking about her while she responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen and bathroom."" It was very close to her workplace and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.

There wasn’t a long line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal—an ordinary red-brick building with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. 

""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt."" 

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up. 

""Hello,"" said the girl wearing a T-shirt with ""Nessa"" on it. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, looked like a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 

""I'm Jo, I work at the post office and called about the flat,"" she said. 

Nessa mentioned they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs—one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" 

""We’ll put your name on a mug if you decide to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of these animals.

Dolphins are special to us. They are among the most intelligent animals, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with dreams of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been supported by television shows. First, there was Flipper, and now we have Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished waters.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by law and cared for in marine reserves, but this is not the case. The lack of protection for dolphins could lead to one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.

There are forty different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out at sea and are often seen in small groups. We know very little about them. In contrast, bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once frequently seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, such as the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, such as skin injuries.

Understanding why dolphin numbers are declining is complicated. Overfishing is greatly reducing fish populations, which threatens both local fishing industries and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They are also at risk of getting caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall, with injuries indicating they were caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also store harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in their fat. Female dolphins produce milk that contains these toxins, which can harm their young. There has been at least one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s contaminated milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.

Exercise improves your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It increases muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries and improves specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Additionally, exercise benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can improve your sleep. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. If these reasons don’t motivate you, just remember that common sense tells us exercise is good for our health.

There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, and weight training. However, be careful not to overdo it, as training too hard can lead to injuries. If you’re unsure about what exercises are right for you, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. Poor posture can make you look and feel less energetic and can lead to minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head upward. This can help you lift your chest for better breathing and make your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It improves flexibility and helps you move easily, while preventing injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Stretching should be done slowly and carefully.

A good exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, an energetic workout, and cooling down afterward."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their comfortable homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman are some of the hardest to find. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to many unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their partnership has produced some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a well-received film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.

This is common for traveling filmmakers, who have been exploring the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He mentioned, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we tend to resolve them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and he believes they get along well because they both view animals in a similar way. ""When we are on the move, we usually set up our tents each night. But this time, we are working from a more fixed camp. We set out at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so meal preparation can be stressful,"" says Newman. 

Their life can be tough, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman recalls filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often wander off. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions, and eventually, she included their car in her greetings.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" says Newman, ""because it was clear we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the atmosphere, brings the true spirit of the place and animals to life, and touches people's hearts. I believe evoking an emotional response is much more powerful than just appealing to logic."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that’s it.""

Kendra explained, ""My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to improve her fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose."" But once the game is over, players become friends. 

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It’s essential that we all think and train like world-class players."" As captain, she believes it’s important to have a strong mindset and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""

Kendra has carefully planned her netball career from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she is likely to have tears of joy, knowing her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, Rachel says, ""Space is very limited. I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

""If there is an emergency and we need to get to the surface quickly, we can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but I imagine it would not be a pleasant experience.""

Rachel recalls her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on 'black smokers,' another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke, pouring out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied black smokers for three years for my Ph.D., and seeing them in person was an amazing experience."""
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone of voice, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believes being on time is very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, explains that candidates who take care of their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. While people often say that what matters is inside, it is important to present yourself well in an interview.

Many people overlook the importance of a professional image. For instance, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Body language and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our words and facial expressions send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also crucial not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview, leading to an immediate job offer. She was very excited but showed too much enthusiasm. Once her boss sensed her excitement, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what you say and how you say it can greatly affect your interview success. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can help you understand the company's activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can show your genuine interest.

Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions prepared and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators use short sentences and highlight key points."""
FCE_36,"**A NEW LIFE**

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City became boring—no one was enjoying it anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I was unexpectedly laid off. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel that has one of the top 20 restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed for me: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and I’m still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right choice. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many of them visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were awful. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even longer hours, so I decided to leave. Many people thought I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. Since my business is related to fashion, I have to keep up with collections and trends, which keeps me busy. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I do miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one who faces the consequences. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He shares, ""I was in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I decided to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Eventually, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future, which is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Athletes Share Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s fun there with great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be very disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I could go out, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn. To succeed, I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind giving that up, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it’s worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. Winning the championship also led to me being chosen to host a surfing series on TV, so I guess I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Being on a boat with my teammates is always fun. We have a traditional way of celebrating our wins, and some people say we act a bit childish, but we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to return home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. It’s not healthy to focus only on sailing all the time. I am known in the sailing world, but I rarely get recognized in public, which I prefer. I receive many nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. At my last tournament, things got a bit hectic with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its challenges. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I received too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that contributed to our breakup, which was tough. However, sacrifices are necessary in any sport, and I try to stay focused and professional. I’m happy to concentrate on my game now and will catch up on other aspects of life after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it's the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty when she buys them unhealthy items, but she also hates saying no all the time. This makes her feel frustrated before they even leave the house. Although she tries to avoid taking them shopping, she worries that she is not giving them the chance to learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are a key place where this advertising is effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain items, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when faced with attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, even if those ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, especially since children often only hear about products from advertisements, which gives them a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes that the goal of advertising is still to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she feels uneasy about how she handles their shopping requests. She has talked to her son so much about advertisements that he now thinks they are not trustworthy. As a result, they have less conflict in the supermarket because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, admits that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, while they themselves buy rich foods like double cream and chocolate. He finds it reasonable for children to want nice things, but he still feels annoyed by their requests. His willingness to say yes often depends on his mood and how well things are going in his life.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any lost sales."
FCE_20,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin has been created after extensive research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This approach has allowed the hotel to include the latest technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel’s computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time because of its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel’s clientele, making up about 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by laying extra cables and renting televisions, so they can easily upgrade to newer models.

Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed by technology. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are both cozy and inviting. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion Hotel is of high quality, thanks to Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who moved his already Michelin-starred restaurant to the hotel. This move has allowed him to create a new, modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a successful restaurant on-site is a great advantage with minimal financial risk. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to thrive."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""For me, excitement is key. I need challenges and new things to learn to feel energized. I also get energy from rhythm; right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is expressive and uplifting. If I'm bored, I feel drained and like life has no purpose. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. Work is not a burden for me. Enjoying what I do helps me feel good, even when I'm tired. I need enough sleep to feel my best. When I only get six hours, I feel sluggish. Exercise boosts my energy, but I sometimes struggle to find the motivation. I attend a yoga class weekly and try to work out at home. After exercising, my mood improves significantly. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't rely on healthy eating for energy; I think it's about having natural enthusiasm and a positive attitude. I dislike negativity. I believe we should enjoy life and seize the moment. Achieving goals is important, and I love my work. The last two years have been exciting, surrounded by lively young people. I enjoy being busy and social. I like taking photos, even if I'm not great at it, and I write lyrics for fun, which helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and being positive in life. I enjoy working with children because they are full of energy and resilience. Energy is like a natural spark that comes from connecting with others—just smile at someone and see how it feels when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is transforming a wasteland into a garden. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also gives me energy. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if caught, I playfully say I didn't know it was private. I find joy in that childlike adventure.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe it's important to have an interest in and respect for what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don't want to do drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found their demands exhausting. You have limited energy, so focus it on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron skates appeared in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the wealthy in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating very popular.

Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed will improve as you get better. Your body position is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is essential in skating, more than in many other sports.

To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outward. Push off with your back foot while making a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you practice this, you can gradually make longer movements as you gain confidence. Learning how to fall safely is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall without getting hurt, stay relaxed to reduce the impact with the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel and then stand up.

Once you feel comfortable on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn the basic moves, and soon you can practice turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle.

If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed and fluid their movements are. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise routine. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens your body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent fitness program for overall health."

Seeing a talented child receive a medal can bring tears of joy. Julia Gregson spoke to three young achievers and their mothers about the joys and challenges they face.

A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""Training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I’m really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother** says, ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen other parents push their kids, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika’s level requires a lot of time and energy, and she has to want it herself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from around the world and gained confidence through her success.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at age ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents enjoy show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement and fun of show-jumping. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I’m determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I’m not doing it for them. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team, and my big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's mother** shares, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age one, I knew she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is very organized and feels completely happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed in something they love is an incredible feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is Britain’s Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should; I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant, and I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like feeling embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's mother** explains, ""Jane played her first game at age five. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. I’m proud when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to discourage her because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall at that age. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are starting to reach our true potential, similar to the Cro-Magnons who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

Research in Ohio showed that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a blessing, some anthropologists see it as a health disaster. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland could support many more people than hunting could.

Today, many people who rely on farming are poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we grow? 

According to Robert Fogel from the University, we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even with good nutrition. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be part of an audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this question. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of television, but many of us find them mysterious. When we see people getting excited on game shows, we often wonder who they are. 

Studio audiences are often seen as the least important type of audience. Some people in the television industry even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience; they come from various backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different kinds of people for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home don’t understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit through hours of boredom just to watch something they could see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on television. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason people attend is out of curiosity to see how things work behind the scenes. However, the most common reason I heard was simply, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it’s like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond accordingly. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed the feeling of being part of live television. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" I found that I missed seeing the live actors; I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were filmed far from my seat, so I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters. For most audience members, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,"**Favorite Places**

**Bruce**  
I don't like wild landscapes that are untouched by people. The human aspect is important to me. This is also true when I travel abroad. I am drawn to charming villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape from school. I enjoyed exploring the bare hilltops, sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary, which was my first attempt at travel writing, a field in which I later became well-known.

There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by enthusiasts. I always choose first class because it doesn’t cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery isn’t spectacular. The train travels across Romney Marsh with its sheep and alongside a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers get a glimpse into people’s lives as they make tea, wash dishes, or set up deckchairs. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people’s homes. It’s the simplicity of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me look more closely, searching for something that opens my eyes.

The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coastline. The beaches are hard to reach and filled with rocks, so there are not many crowds here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to admire the power of the sea. The coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there and not many visitors either. It’s a quiet and remote area, and I enjoy the feeling of space. I discovered this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed very little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits even more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is the house of my dreams. It is a magical, secluded, romantic place. You can only hear the sea, the wind, and the birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals of all kinds. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had prepared a special tank for such visitors, allowing us to admire them and look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The chaos involved our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca, which I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the children’s flailing arms.

In the midst of the confusion, I tripped and fell. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat continued to jump around in a wild, noisy mess. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. 

I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, this same mouse was caught by Domino three more times during its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged by my success with the cat, I examined the snake but found no weak points. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, hoping to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked suspicious. I carefully slid my hands under the snake and stood up, walking to the end of the garden. There, I pointed the snake towards a tree, giving it the chance to live happily in the wild.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to strike, it instead wrapped around my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter. We stood together in the fading light, with my four children, me, and the snake. My eldest son, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""

I asked the children to gently encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished from sight, my three-year-old son, Clay, sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

In our fast-paced world of phones, faxes, and computers, the traditional art of letter writing is in danger of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter brings a special joy that no other form of communication can match. There is excitement when a letter arrives, pleasure in seeing who it is from, and enjoyment in reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back to me. Sometimes my father would write long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters from home shared everyday events about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch through letters. Surprisingly, writing letters seemed to strengthen our relationships. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than in conversation.

I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. While short notes are nice, it’s even better to receive a full year’s worth of news! I especially love getting airmail letters with beautiful stamps. I have friends who write to me from different countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. There’s also a woman from France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant after a holiday, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a wonderful friendship. Now, we write regularly, which helps me improve my French since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited each other’s homes twice.

My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our friendship lasted so long, and the local newspaper even featured our story on the front page.

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did for my mother. She and my son also have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend.

I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are slowly being destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain, which was once a place for prayer and worship, has drawings that are about 4,000 years old. These include images of cows with horns, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and blurs the artwork. Some visitors even break off pieces to take home as souvenirs. ""When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,"" he explains. ""The drawings are naturally polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the entire mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees with de Lumley's strict proposal, saying, ""While it is the most effective, it will certainly lead to protests from local residents."" He emphasizes that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture years ago, and we must do everything possible to protect it.

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also prefers not to close the site. He states, ""De Lumley's idea isn't ideal. Our department believes the best solution is to let people visit, but the area is so large that it's hard to stop visitors from causing damage. I would like everyone to see it, but the main issue is financial. We do not have enough money to hire the necessary number of guards. We may need to consider charging an entrance fee, as there seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to access—tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to cordon off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she argues. ""That is not acceptable. Funding must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing these drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it's the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty when she buys them these things, but she also hates saying no all the time. This makes her feel frustrated before they even leave the house. Although she tries to avoid taking them shopping, she worries that she is not letting them learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are a key place where this advertising is effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain items, and arguments about the health risks of sugar are not convincing when faced with appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, even if those ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, especially since children often only hear about products from TV ads, which gives them a limited view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes that the goal of advertising is still to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she feels uneasy about how she handles their requests. She has talked to her son about advertisements so much that he now thinks they are not trustworthy. As a result, they have less conflict in the supermarket because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, admits that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, while they themselves buy rich foods like double cream and chocolate. He finds it enjoyable to buy nice things and understands why children want to share in that. However, he also feels annoyed by their requests, which can depend on his mood. If he is feeling good, he is more likely to say yes, making it hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by moving sweets away from checkout areas or by providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any lost sales."
FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

In the past, climbers would go to the mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches in excitement as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. The ability to hold such events is thanks to new and rapidly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. Since they couldn’t use cliffs for much of the year, they started to train on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom from not climbing.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls specifically for training, using bricks with special edges for grip. One of the first climbing walls was created by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He came up with the idea of embedding natural rock into concrete blocks to create climbing walls. Throughout the 1970s, many similar walls were built in sports halls across the country, but they had clear design issues. These walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once built, the walls couldn’t be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes, no matter how many holds they tried.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any existing wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to experiment with panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for creating overhanging walls without significant construction, but steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**

If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will likely mention that it is a risky career. Acting is indeed risky because there are many more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to pursue acting, some people you thought were your close friends might think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will have different opinions, but this is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own path and dreams.

There are no easy shortcuts to becoming an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee of success in the profession. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and the profession can offer excitement, glamour, and sometimes financial rewards.

Many people ask what talent is. I believe talent is a combination of natural ability and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves a person's courage and their belief in what they are doing. 

The desire to act can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often do not have a clear answer. They understand some things about their skills and techniques, but they do not take their success for granted. They know they are only as good as their last job, and their fame can be temporary.

Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. One month, you might be unemployed, working in a store or as a waitress. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. However, no matter how much you want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competing for roles and the fear of rejection. No one enjoys being rejected, and this possibility exists from the moment you start auditioning professionally. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. Ultimately, if you do not care enough about your acting career, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago. 

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

Research in Ohio showed that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a blessing, some anthropologists see it as a public health problem. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland could support many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are poorly nourished, but wealthier countries like those in Europe, the US, and Japan are starting to eat better again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive change, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

According to Robert Fogel from the University, we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even with good nutrition. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City became boring—no one was enjoying it anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right choice. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many visit us now.""

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She shares, ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were awful. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even longer hours, so I decided to leave. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. Since my business is related to fashion, I have collections and seasonal designs to manage, so there’s always a lot to do, and I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one who faces the consequences. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the promotional materials, you care even more.""

I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left voluntarily and traveled for a year. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future, which is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**A Winning Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, enjoying their past. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, an ancient game they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played together, and as Dave says, ""having the best time ever."" 

Later, the family moved to New Mexico, but they kept playing with their grandfather's pichenotte board, made from old wooden crates. When visitors came over, they were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed how worn out the old board was and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted one too. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" Dave recalls, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon they were sitting down, and you couldn't get them up from the table!""

When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched it. He found that the game likely started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This was adapted into a game called 'squails' played in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. The game can be played by two to four people and requires skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' that they flick across a wheel-like board using their middle or index finger. Getting a puck into a small hole earns 20 points, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity increased. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start a pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and began making boards. So far, they have produced over 450 boards, made of birchwood and mahogany, each weighing 12 kg and 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable, as they have to withstand a lot of use."" They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to create pichenotte stars. However, the day may come when the brothers' garage will hold a luxury Mercedes instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first arrive at the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was an empty, overgrown piece of land. For a long time, it was seen as useless. However, through careful planning and hard work by one man, with the support of his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful site you see today.

During the construction of the village, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. While machines like bulldozers helped with this transformation, a lot of manual labor was also involved. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. 

In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants were carefully chosen to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most of the plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who created over 100 models over nine years after the village opened in 1972. The models are made from various materials, including stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics, to endure different weather conditions. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last over time, but he quickly became skilled himself.

You will notice that a consistent scale has been used, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details of the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and upkeep. The methods used to create these realistic models have been adopted in other model villages across England and have even been included in college courses on modeling.

All the buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place. One of the most impressive structures is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you explore the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini-golf course, which is the newest addition.

We kindly ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can take hours to repair. You are welcome to take photos from the pathways only, and dogs are allowed on a short lead.

To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these buttons will make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we would appreciate any feedback you have. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more diverse and interesting display. We also want to know if there are any models that you think need improvement. We are constantly updating the models and need your input on which ones require attention.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of practice. While some pop stars do pose for paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle such problems. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos, and since she was in a hotel—a place where people expect privacy—she had a valid reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation on its own. It should also look into the recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on this and other disgraceful stories?

At first glance, this seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and shown on TV and radio. The public would not support such behavior, and editors would have to stop publishing this kind of material. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide behind trees to take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', it would face several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an investigation? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to file a complaint? And if the person still refused to act, should the PCC proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and they could be upset if it wasn’t.

Moreover, the PCC's role would be too vast. How could it realistically monitor all of the British press, including national, regional, and magazine publications? There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy has been violated, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most likely, they just want to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet, such as a worse story they want to keep hidden from the press, knowing that complaining could bring it to light. In this way, the PCC could become an enemy.

One British comedian faced problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. His reason was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find a simple solution to this serious issue."
FCE_38,"Many college graduates receive advice when starting their first job. This article focuses on what to consider when moving to a second job. We will not discuss those looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those who leave a job they dislike within a few weeks. Instead, we will talk about those of you who are ready to take a significant step in your career. You have gained some experience and skills and have a clearer idea of your career goals.

What kind of job should you seek? It largely depends on your long-term goals. Ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher responsibilities, or explore a broader field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully, as you should plan to stay in it for two to three years. Future employers will closely examine this job when you apply for your next position. It should demonstrate that you have thought seriously about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow, develop your skills, and increase your responsibilities.

If you feel the urge to travel, now might be a good time to do so. You can take temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are less likely to leave again soon.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after graduating from St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors. It was a great first job because they were supportive, and she learned how to navigate an office and improve her word processing skills. However, there was no opportunity for advancement. Eventually, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more capable, and my job has really evolved. From the start, my boss was eager to help me grow. My job title is the same as when I began, but my responsibilities have changed. I now handle most of the correspondence and budgets, and I deal with various inquiries, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own businesses. Brenda includes me in all her work and also assigns me specific projects and events to organize."""
FCE_17,"**Text: 'What is the Secret of Confident People?**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but many will say it is a skill they learned over time. Nina Hathway interviews five individuals to find out how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was nervous but surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I felt very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was a turning point in my life that helped everything else improve.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became overly aggressive and impatient, thinking that was how confident people acted. Eventually, I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work becomes too overwhelming, I don’t feel guilty about postponing some tasks. When facing challenges, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can destroy confidence, so I often have quiet conversations with myself to overcome those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as very confident, but the calmer I appear, the more scared I actually feel. I had to learn to look confident because it is essential in TV. Interviewing people made me realize that most of us feel tense in important situations, and we feel better when talking to someone friendly. The best advice I received was from my mother when I worried about my appearance as a teenager. She said, ""Who’s looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about how they look."" I remember this often. I also believe that facing your fears helps build confidence. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I would never be that scared again, and I haven’t been.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am well-liked in the restaurant, but I know that not everyone will like me. I don’t let that bother me. You must appreciate yourself for who you are, not try to meet others' expectations. My company offers many training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. They also encourage us to set realistic goals. It is very helpful to see that you are achieving something, rather than aiming too high and ending up with nothing.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings, disagreeing with what was said but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I first entered politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, ""Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too."" I also found it helpful to write down a few notes to refer to, like a comfort blanket! I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking publicly. The real secret to confidence is reminding yourself repeatedly, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional—if the line breaks, the finder keeps it... and I have plenty more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a row of tense competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites shot into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each participant entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 

""Flying kites isn't too hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how to do it."" I received five invitations that day and decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he asked me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A narrow boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before starting my hike, it would have been helpful to know that most of the distance was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and thousands of creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First came the wind, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. As I slid downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being washed away (which sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I will always remember it for the kindness of its people."
FCE_48,"What kind of shopper are you? Whether you love it or hate it, shopping is something we all do. There are different types of shoppers. Do you know which type you are? Abby Edwards asked several people about their shopping habits:

A. Melanie, 22, dancer  
""I'm addicted to shopping! When I have money, I go out and it makes me happy. I can't resist sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often go shopping together. We're a couple of shopaholics!""

B. Brenda, 40, office manager  
""I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the grocery shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don’t spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter shopping, but it’s hard because we all have different tastes. I don’t often buy things for myself, so when I do, I feel guilty and usually tell my husband I spent less than I really did because the real price seems shocking.""

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager  
""I only shop for essentials. I dislike shopping and only go when I have to. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and won’t settle for anything else. Shopping is tiring, and I’d rather be doing something else.""

D. Anita, 35, TV producer  
""I enjoy browsing sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to get in and out quickly. However, I do have some items in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m a careful shopper who occasionally makes mistakes.""

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary  
""I really dislike shopping. I find it hard to find clothes I like or anyone to help me. The shops are noisy and messy, which makes it a nightmare for me. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often since I usually receive them as gifts. For food shopping, I go to the supermarket once a week and get it done quickly.""

F. Lisa, 22, actress  
""I’m probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my friends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I’ll buy it.""

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant  
""I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t go overboard. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often regret spending too much.""

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker  
""I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too crowded. I consider myself a careful shopper. I usually have a good idea of what I want and don’t rush into buying things. I like to check other shops to find better deals, which takes me a long time!""

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager  
""I’m an unwilling shopper. Since I work in the city center, shopping has lost its appeal for me. When I have to shop, I go reluctantly and don’t bother trying things on because it’s too much effort. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind too much. I’d rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of time in shops."""

**Easter Quiz for Children**  
During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about surprises. Free quiz sheets are available at the desk by the Orange Street entrance. Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer various questions about them. The quiz sheets can be picked up from 25 March to 9 April during normal gallery hours.

**New Artwork**  
The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch painter Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The artwork is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for specific flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is currently displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition titled ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this time: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until 31 May.

**Lecture Series**  
The series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will talk about Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will focus on Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often tell stories through their paintings.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery is pleased to announce that the restaurant has improved and expanded its services. With new kitchens, the restaurant now offers a wide variety of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Visitor Information**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery are available every day at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (except Sundays). These tours highlight some of the Gallery's greatest artworks and showcase a wide range of important European paintings from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where kids can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometer. The main difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of money, known as 'currencies,' to make trading easier. Eventually, different currencies began to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."
PET_46,"**Write a Winning Story!**

You have a chance to win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in *Keep Writing* magazine. Ten other winners will receive £100 each. We are looking for people who can write great stories. The judges include novelist Mary Littlejohn, television reporter Michael Brown, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of *Keep Writing*. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything, but here are some tips to help you get started:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, many stories focused on love, family, and friendship problems. However, you should make ordinary situations interesting so that readers want to read more. Try to present everyday topics in a new and surprising way.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: If you describe a place or explain something technical, make sure your information is correct. Only write about things you are sure about.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an engaging way and end it with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your plot carefully and think of something unexpected for the conclusion.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using descriptive language. Help the reader connect with them.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a new rule. Your story must not have been published in any form, including on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. 

The entry fee is £5, which goes to the Writers' Association. Please make your cheque payable to *Keep Writing* and send it with your application form and story to us. The closing date is July 30, and we will notify the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have any of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created several scientific tools to assist her work. During her time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. Grass is unique because it can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way.

One of the remarkable features of grass is its ability to recover quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike many other plants, grass grows new leaves from below the soil rather than from the top. This allows many animals to live together in the same area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh food source."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion and recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream of making fashion her career. She believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.

After finishing her studies, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. Although she had to attend industry events, she couldn't afford the designer clothes she admired. To solve this, she began making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends noticed her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. This led her to find a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes became very popular, and nothing was returned, which motivated her to leave her advertising job. She took out a £20,000 loan to start her own womenswear brand.

Kal's parents were supportive of her decision to change careers, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award.

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs. However, serious flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is very good. The railway was originally built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to Australia’s southern cities via Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent.

It is rare to complete a transcontinental railway, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south railway. As I waited to board the Ghan, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners, and they were especially eager to get on the train. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip up the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged anymore, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop their journey there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. However, at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was coming to an end, and although the train did not meet all the promises made in advertisements, it had taken me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high, making it probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowl-shaped areas cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are necessary because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. 

Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, we still felt nervous when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.

The path quickly became steep, and my legs felt heavy. As the weakest member of the group, I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start climbing again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. This path is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. Unfortunately, we were not so lucky because a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as difficult as climbing up. You need to read a map carefully because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I truly enjoyed the experience when I was safely in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, similar to our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The construction took several months, and we watched it all happen. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant some beautiful open space was lost. The noise from the construction machines was very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to worry that the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms that are huge—much larger than those in our old school, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings and other events. There is also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and large changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the students, teachers, and the computers we use. The building is designed so well that it keeps all the heat inside. It also keeps the sound in, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof because it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for our lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so large that it can be seen from far away! We took some pictures that we plan to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

PET_2,"Text: 'No Title A month ago, I never imagined that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place we stayed wasn't great, but it had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. 

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn were with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn’t know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren’t sure how. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally made it out—covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done.'"
PET_23,"Letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday afternoon, I accidentally left my handbag on the bus. Inside were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I felt lost: I am 72 years old, far from home, and quite worried. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what had happened. He kindly gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he told me I could keep the fare. I made it home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had found it and offered to bring it back to me.

I was amazed to get my handbag back, with everything inside still there. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me that day. Their kindness and honesty meant a lot to me.

Mrs. B. James, Newport"
PET_60,"**Sharks**

Sharks are among the most intimidating animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they prey on. 

While sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are quite different. For instance, most sharks must keep swimming constantly to breathe and survive, which means they hardly ever sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can become completely still. This is a useful method for researchers who need to study sharks, as it helps them learn more about these intriguing creatures."

PET_53,"Text: 'Joining the Kirov Ballet

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they switched to English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers well.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mother stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I was feeling lonely. The classes in Russia are much harder than those in my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence to meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was extremely cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the locals said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

Right now, we are preparing for a new production, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to experience the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people began to see the long, dark winter as a unique opportunity. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a structure made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors.

One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous around the world. When winter arrives, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from different countries come to Jukkasjarvi to construct the hotel for that year. As each section is finished, it opens to visitors and guests, while other parts are still being built. The first section is completed in December, and each week a new section opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully finished.

Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date can change depending on the weather. In spring, as temperatures rise, the hotel begins to melt. Inside the hotel, the temperature stays between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing, such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves, as part of their stay. It is also wise for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose shoes that are slightly larger than usual to fit thick socks.

If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items along with your booking, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is located in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture store, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The store's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer who was called to the store said, ""We knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them. Another issue was that there was a long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people chose to leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few meters to the store, which blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said, ""I waited in line for three hours, and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice; it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had dived deeper the previous year using a balloon to help her come back up, this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. This achievement made her the only woman in any sport to break a world record previously held by a man.

A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at different depths. After several serious accidents involving other divers, some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous. However, Tanya disagrees, emphasizing that safety and training are the most important aspects of the sport.

Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya follows a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done in the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking as a good way to stay fit.

When preparing for practice dives, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive. It is crucial for her to avoid fatigue, as being tired could ruin her preparation.

When not training for events, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects and films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. Tanya feels that her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is well-known in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she discusses environmental issues.

Looking to the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. She started free-diving at the age of twenty-five and is eager to emphasize that she does not plan to retire from the sport for many years."
PET_12,"CARTOON FILMS

Cartoon films have very few restrictions. If you can draw something, you can make it come to life on the screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry believed that cartoons were only for children. However, soon after, a few directors introduced original ideas. They showed that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Not every cartoon film was a success, though. For instance, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to earn a lot of money again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson shares her experience with her first TV role. 

""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to turn the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to audition for the role. At first, my mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. 

Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends about the filming, but they found out and thought it was amazing. It was a wonderful experience, and I feel very lucky. After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I’m not from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I felt a bit lost. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I’m going to Greece for the summer with friends."""
PET_8,"When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, my main goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a fast-growing international company. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is shared in this book. I believe our company has valuable insights on how to run a successful business while staying true to our beliefs. 

This is not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The main message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can make a positive impact. In both business and life, I want to have fun, feel a sense of family, and be excited by surprises. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to share this feeling. 

Now, this book spreads my ideas to the world and makes them known. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' or to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."

On the ship, which has air conditioning, you will find a sun deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop, and library.

**Itinerary**

**Day 1:** Depart in the early evening from London Heathrow to Oporto. A guide will meet you upon arrival and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.

**Day 2:** After a morning of sightseeing in Oporto, you will return to the ship and set off for Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey up the river takes four hours.

**Day 3:** You will continue your journey up the river. In the early evening, the ship will stop at Peso da Regua, known for its port wine production. At dinner, you can enjoy delicious local food and drink.

**Day 4:** After breakfast, you will travel south by bus to the ancient town of Lamego. You will visit the cathedral, several churches, and a museum that was once a palace, featuring a great collection of paintings, tapestries, and sculptures. Afterward, you will return to the ship and sail to Tua.

**Day 5:** The Douro River becomes very narrow at this point. Depending on the river's depth, you may take a smaller boat to the Spanish border at Barca d'Alva. The return journey to Tua will be by coach, with many sights to see along the way.

**Day 6:** In the morning, you will drive to Sao Joao da Pesqueira for one of the best views in the Douro Valley. After lunch on the ship, you will take the Douro Valley railway for a scenic ride through the countryside to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be waiting for you.

**Day 7:** You will visit Vila Real before returning to the ship for lunch and then sailing down the river to Oporto. You will spend the night on board the Lady Ivy May.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with plenty of time for sightseeing and last-minute shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. To create just half a kilo of honey, bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder flavor compared to darker honey.

In ancient times, honey was the main source of sweetness because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and enhance athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used to soothe sore throats and is included in many skin and hair care products."
PET_7,"**Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it an important center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. For the next 300 years, it continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. The city has a growing student population and is a modern commercial center, being the largest hub for insurance services outside London. 

Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and several arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear. 

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich dealt with a large construction site in the city center as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with water features and many trees. Fortunately, the old open market remains in the heart of the city, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich successfully combines its rich history with modern life."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to participate at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots communicate with each other via radio and light up their balloon burners at the same time. This event is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great chance to take beautiful photographs. To see the balloon glows, you should arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 AM, as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, with some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, as well as popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies that offer rides. Another option is to ride the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a stunning view of the festival.

There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for ballooning. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival. Wear several layers of light clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are important. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."
PET_51,"The Eden Project

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this former industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, demonstrating the important relationship between people and plants. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled heaters maintain the right temperature for the plants. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid due to a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone in the near future."
PET_11,"Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I don't understand why. After all, 500 pages of original writing for just £6.99 is quite impressive, isn't it? The majority of the book consists of fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable works by well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have focused on food in their pieces. I recommend being cautious with Jane Harris's story, Those Nails—it is best not to read it right after eating, as it contains some very disturbing scenes! The collection also features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Additionally, there are excerpts from novels in progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a small amount of non-fiction, including a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and a remarkable piece by Ursula Owen about her own life. Overall, this is an outstanding collection, and I am excited to see what next year's edition will bring."
PET_14,"**The Best Age to Learn the Violin**

Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher, believes that the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. She explains that this is a time when children are discovering the world around them. Living in London, Margaret usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she has also accepted some eager five-year-olds.

When Margaret began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class included her children’s friends who were five years old. Her students learn in groups, with about twelve children in each class. Each lesson lasts one hour and takes place every two weeks. Additionally, every student has one individual lesson with her each week. It is also important for parents to attend these classes, as their involvement is crucial for the children’s learning.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play music by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a noticeable difference between how well they can play and how well they can read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not designed to create expert violinists. Instead, she encourages students who excel to leave and pursue more traditional methods of violin study."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to their previous album, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott has joined as the new bass guitarist, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Additionally, Tom Simpson is now playing the drums.

From the first song, which is a dance track, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and more energetic. Most of the later songs return to the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will likely surprise many fans, but either could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford has a chance to showcase his talent, hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded these songs before experiencing throat problems, which led the band to cancel their upcoming tour. However, anyone who bought tickets should not worry, as the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.

On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in different styles, from the slow songs fans know to upbeat tracks that make you want to dance. I felt that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Nevertheless, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."
PET_36,"**San Francisco**

San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land, not by sea.

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest individuals were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill known as Nob Hill.

Today, San Francisco attracts many tourists who want to see famous sites like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many visitors also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to explore the former prison there."
PET_6,"**SAMUEL PEPYS**

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It provides a detailed and interesting look at daily life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys discusses important events of that time, such as diseases, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his own mistakes—like often falling asleep in church or admiring pretty girls. He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they made up, as well as his concerns about her health. Besides reading, he enjoyed music, theater, card games, and parties with good food and fun. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles; he was a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not focus on making shoes comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people wrapped around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. 

It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes were handmade in the past, but now, while some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are produced by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to create many more shoes at lower prices, making them available to more people."
PET_20,"**No Title**

When I hurt my back, I had to take a break from running. I wanted to encourage more women to join the sport, to show them how enjoyable it can be, and to help them feel confident about running. I decided to start a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with how many race organizers think. They often complain about the low number of women in running but use this as a reason not to provide separate changing rooms.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't think about the fun of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. 

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about diet and fitness from other runners. I wanted to support women's running, and it has been a joy to see their progress—almost as much joy as they have felt themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this problem, a winter trail was created in 1910 for dog teams pulling sleds. These teams delivered mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams as the main transport. However, in 1925, the dogs gained fame again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. At that time, airplanes were new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away on a trip. So, it was decided to transport the medicine using dog teams instead.

The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail, and took twenty teams just six days to complete. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the heavy snow, and Togo proved to be a great help. The final part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, preventing the team from falling into icy water. Thanks to their efforts, the diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."
PET_45,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite the cold, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to experience one of Europe’s most unique hotels. In this hotel, everything is made of ice, including the rooms where guests eat, drink, and sleep. You can even have a wedding there. The bar is also made of ice, so it is not a good idea to place hot drinks on it!

The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags that keep them warm in such cold conditions. If needed, the hotel can also provide suitable outdoor clothing. The Ice Hotel is rebuilt every winter because it melts in the summer, and it is never older than six months. Building the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."
PET_29,"**Maria Mutola**

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized she was very fast.

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand at first because I only knew about football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help improve their lives. They agreed to let him take her away to train.

In 1991, Maria accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had previously refused because she was worried about missing her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother."
PET_57,"**The Skywalk**

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and especially to enjoy the stunning views. One of the highlights is the Skywalk. This platform is 1,219 meters above the bottom of the canyon and is made of glass, allowing visitors to see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on the Skywalk at the same time. It opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of visitors have experienced it. To protect the glass, you must wear special covers over your shoes. Walking on the Skywalk gives you the feeling of floating like a bird high in the air."
PET_9,"**THE ROCKIES**

The Rocky Mountains stretch nearly the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest but are also found a few hundred miles from the center in the southern regions. Although the Rockies are not as tall as the Alps, they are still incredibly beautiful. There are many roads that cross the Rockies, but the best way to experience them is by train. 

You can start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful cities. This city is located by the water and near the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the journey is still an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you will see some of the most stunning views at night."
PET_42,"**ZOOS**

People have been keeping animals in zoos for over 3,000 years, starting with a large zoo in China called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals were trained to perform for visitors, but this practice has stopped. Now, the main purpose of zoos is to allow people to see animals in their natural behaviors.

Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters argue that zoos help us learn about the natural world and allow us to see wild animals up close, which would be difficult without them. 

On the other hand, some people oppose zoos. They believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages and argue that poorly managed zoos can lead to animals living in dirty conditions and being fed inappropriate food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all experienced in competitions, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially since we are all so young. Musicians from each band even made up new songs right on stage. It was thrilling to watch, but even more exciting when my band performed!  

Our school has a fantastic jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often hang out after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps around the country. I have attended a few and learned a lot.  

Many adults are surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes it is because pop music is not challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music while also being part of its history, performing like the great jazz artists before you. My school is fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we would not make progress in our music!"
PET_54,"**Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is not very common. When it does rain, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Many winters have been dry recently, so when rain finally comes, the local people appreciate it. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they are supported by a system of underground channels built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains throughout the year. Places that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases.

Traveling further south from Marrakesh, you reach Skoura. Here, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels, which are used to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter create a beautiful backdrop."
PET_32,"**Gareth Ellis**

Gareth Ellis, 13, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always dreamed of being a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. ""People laugh when we tell them,"" says Kath. ""But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three.""

When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found work with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and return home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away.

""I can't say it was easy,"" says Kath. ""There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving behind our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""

""People ask about my education,"" says Gareth, ""but from the start, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I use the same books as everyone back at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates.""

And what about the future? ""It was a tough decision,"" says Kath, ""but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day,"" he says, ""maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to important national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and participate in projects. We plan to open more centers nationwide. Since our agency started in 1994, originally called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined. Sophie is one of them. She says, ""I first learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was impressed by the opportunities they had. Age didn’t matter; they were trusted to work on their own stories. I began attending the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share their skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, please call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here, you will find all the information you need before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. These flights take you over Antarctica and back. The exact dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is also a camera next to the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit throughout the flight.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot will fly in long 'figure 8s' over interesting sights so that everyone can see them well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain will check the satellite images of the clouds and choose the direction that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Absolutely! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothing."
PET_35,"**Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, explains, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Driving in winter can be dangerous because conditions can change quickly, leading to accidents. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill, and ice can be hidden under melting snow, making the road slippery. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. You can think of it like driving with a full cup of hot coffee next to you—drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to stay alert to potential dangers. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Practice how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Keep in mind that you might be driving faster than you realize. Generally, you should allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times that on snow, and even more on ice. Always try to keep control of your car to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London with the plan to study law, but instead, he went to art school. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art, which sparked his interest in early Italian artists. This influence can be seen in some of his paintings. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his work. 

To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark, but he admits he never knows how the final result will turn out. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top."" Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it seem easy. He says, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just pay attention to what colors are next to each other.""

Unlike some artists, Aitchison does not make drawings before starting a painting. He believes that if he did, he might lose interest and not finish the painting. Instead, he often changes his paintings many times before they are complete. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, Aitchison has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any artistic tradition; he simply paints in his own way. Nevertheless, his work continues to inspire young British painters."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" Eventually, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you need to think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical talent—after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did as a teenager—but they do perform regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but that hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. This college offers young people important experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to study for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from all over the world, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in useful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is the diversity of its students, who come from various social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are £20,000 for two years, many students receive financial support. About a quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because of government assistance.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed that I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education through effective methods."
PET_47,"**Being an Older Student**

At 32 years old, I have just completed my first year at university. Along with attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not require much thinking. I became increasingly unhappy with the idea of being stuck in that job. I envied the students at the local university, who seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

However, now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. Still, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is important for getting a rewarding job.

Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. I also enjoy the typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas. I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life is a wise decision."
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born in 1863 on a farm in Michigan, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic, and in 1893, he created his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet lightweight steel, he produced affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_19,"**Rebecca Stevens**

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small apartment in south London. In 1993, Rebecca decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with a group of climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very challenging. 

""You have to carry everything on your back,"" she said. ""This means you can only bring what you really need. There is no way to wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn’t even take a toothbrush. I usually like to stay clean, but there is no water, just snow. Water is heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the happiest moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. She has since written a book about her journey, and people often invite her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. 

Today, Rebecca is well-known and has more money, but she still lives in her small apartment in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains!"

KET_13,"**CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds would not survive if they stayed there. 

Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds won’t know how to migrate in the autumn."" He owned a small plane and decided to teach the geese to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese flew after him.

When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home.

This spring, Bill waited for the geese to come back, but they did not arrive. So, he flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way home on their own!"

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make her own jam. She sold the jam for £1 per jar to her friends and quickly doubled her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not supportive of her decision. They wanted her to focus on studying and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling her jam at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where one of her friends worked.

After two years, her business had grown significantly, and her parents were very proud of her. She produced various types of food, which she sold to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some people to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each one produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to keep them cool.

Five years ago, Jenny tried to sell sweaters made from the wool at country markets, but it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which everyone loved because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business began. 

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she gained thousands of customers. To keep up with demand, she started sending the wool to a factory, where machines now produce all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different types of socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers. 

Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. Her office walls are filled with letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"**BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON**

Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave their homes and forget to close a door or window. 

Inspector Saunders noted that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are ideal for burglars since it gets dark, making it harder for them to be seen. Many houses are also empty during this time because people are still at work.

He suggested that it is wise to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday, as this can deter burglars. Inspector Saunders also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when someone is away and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious. ""We will also provide advice on how to make your house safer,"" he said. ""This assistance is free."""

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming began, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These individuals were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, and over time, their villages grew larger. Some villagers could then focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming could be challenging, especially during bad weather, which sometimes led to food shortages. Today, farmers can produce much more food, and it can travel thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes."
KET_22,"**WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE**

Nicola Peet left school at eighteen, went to college, and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she started working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later joined British Airways as a flight attendant. Four years later, she became a manager. Here is what she shared about her job:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time in the air. I train flight attendants and help them with any issues. I also attend many meetings. My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check flight schedules on my computer, and then I talk to some of the flight attendants. Occasionally, I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are doing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, all I want to do is eat something and then go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""

KET_62,"The Weather People study the weather for many reasons, and it is important for various jobs. For instance, the weather greatly affects farmers. In the past, farmers spent a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Today, we have many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even access weather information on their mobile phones. However, many people still hold on to old beliefs about the weather. For example, some say that a red sky in the evening means it will be sunny the next day. Others believe that if cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small town in Canada. They have been friends and classmates for a long time. Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing and swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework; instead, they have created a new computer word game. 

The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who struggles with reading. Kevin finds it easier to learn words by seeing pictures and hearing sounds rather than by reading. Frazer wanted to help his brother, so he and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to develop the game, which is now ready to use. 

The game combines speaking and pictures. For example, when you see the word ""hat,"" there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying ""Hat! Hat!"" at the same time. The boys have won many awards for their game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in purchasing it."
KET_31,"**How Does the Irish Pop Group 'Boyzone' Live a Healthy Life?**

Sleeping well is very important. When I can go back to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, after a concert, I find it hard to sleep because my mind is full of music. 

Sports are also important. Before my car accident, I used to spend two and a half hours a day at the sports center, five days a week. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups each day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat healthily. I also drink a lot of water because it is good for your health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I don’t always manage that.

People should not work all the time. I love my job, but I also enjoy other activities. In my free time, I like to listen to music or watch TV. It is good to relax sometimes. Since the doctor advised me to eat better, I no longer feel tired. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day, but I still enjoy burgers occasionally!"
KET_58,"**Bollywood**

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, far surpassing the USA. Many Indians prefer watching films to any other leisure activity, with about ten million people going to the cinema every day. 

Bollywood films often focus on romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are key elements in every movie. These films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. 

Indian actors produce more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films have a production cost of around $2 million, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers are often short. 

Amitabh Bachchan, who is considered by some to be India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted almost 40 years."
KET_37,"Bill Bryson

I was born in the United States, but I have written many travel books about England. I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years. For the last three years, we have been back in the United States. Our children are now learning about life here, and I believe they will be happier because they have experienced living in two countries. I enjoy Britain and would like to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is starting college here soon, so it will be another four years before we go back.

Recently, I spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to discuss my new book. Most writers do not enjoy this kind of travel to promote their books, but I do. I like visiting new places and meeting many people. This experience is very different from my writing life in the United States. In England, I was driven around in large cars and stayed in nice hotels. It was great because I didn’t have to pay for anything. Everyone was very kind to me, and I had a lot of fun."
KET_2,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes arrived in England more than 50 years ago, while the Giant Schnauzer is a more recent addition. The name ""Giant"" is fitting because these dogs stand between 65 and 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs regular grooming. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is typically black. 

Schnauzers originate from Germany, where they were used by farmers to assist with sheep herding. They are also employed by the police due to their high intelligence. Schnauzers make excellent family pets as they are friendly and great with young children."
KET_23,"The Ruwenzori Mountains

Mary Daniels is a student from England. This year, she had a very interesting summer holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help build a road through a forest that connects two large towns. 

Mary said, ""It was very difficult because there was no drinking water and no shops to buy food."" She also mentioned that it was very cold and rainy in the mountains, which are known to be one of the wettest places in the world. 

Mary spent six weeks in the mountains. Although the work was hard, she believes it was the best experience of her life. She hopes to return next year to continue her work there."

KET_1,"**New Books This Month**

**The Long Night**  
This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for several years. The story is about Maha, a nurse in northern Australia who works in a small hospital. One day, a baby becomes very sick, and Maha must drive all night to take her to the nearest big city. They face many challenges on their journey.

**Hard Work**  
This exciting story is Joanna Jones's twentieth book. It tells the tale of Sombat, who works with his father, a carpenter, in Thailand. They spend long hours making tables and chairs, but they struggle to earn money. One day, a man dressed in black comes and buys the most beautiful table in their shop.

**Hospital or Cinema?**  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. It follows Tina, a young Brazilian woman whose dream is to become a doctor. She moves to London to study English and medicine, but one day she meets a man who invites her to the USA to become a film star. What choice will Tina make?"
KET_53,"**The History of Horse Racing**

Horse racing has been an important sport since the earliest history books were written. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started in the 12th century when Arab horses were brought to Europe. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses, but this changed in the early 18th century. Races became shorter and included several horses competing against each other. Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball, and it is also very popular in many other parts of the world."

On each trip, Nick travels with a team that brings cameras and other equipment needed for filming. He doesn't pack many personal items, just a few shirts and trousers, but he always makes sure to include some books in his suitcase. Nick's wife, Helen, supports his travels for work. She has many friends and keeps herself busy. When he returns, she enjoys listening to his travel stories. 

However, sometimes there are challenges. While in the Malaysian rainforest, Nick learned that his wife was sick in the hospital. ""I felt awful because I couldn't help her, but she didn't want me to come home. I was so relieved when I found out she was better."""
KET_50,"**Parrots**

You may have seen these beautiful birds with their bright colors and long tails in forests or zoos. Parrots are found in countries such as Brazil, Australia, and India. They usually live in large groups, and because they enjoy eating fruit, they can sometimes cause problems for farmers. There are many different types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet, which they use for climbing and holding food. The largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are very loud, but they are also intelligent and can be taught to talk easily. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"HOWARD BONNIER Bray is a lovely village located about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there around three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier yet, but he is already quite well-known in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in the country. He is only 29 years old. 

When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he chose to spend his money on visiting France and dining in good restaurants instead of buying many clothes and CDs. He also collected a lot of French and English cookbooks—he says he has over two hundred and fifty! 

So, why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says starting your own restaurant is expensive and cooking for fifty people is much harder than cooking for your family, but he believes he has made the right choice."
KET_34,"**John Pickering**

In a small town in central England, John Pickering mows the grass and waters the flowers in a park.

A few months ago, John traveled to Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his music and played it on his radio show. Many young people called the station, asking to hear his songs again.

John, who goes by the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, plans to continue working in the park in England. He is unsure how much money he will make from his music. ""I need to keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have bills to pay!"" The other gardeners do not know about his fame in Japan; they have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This will not change our life. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

Many people in Britain have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. In nearly every town, you can find clubs and classes for this fun activity. 

""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to meet new friends.

KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, we see police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid well. Around 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people lived in poverty. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, which made people afraid to leave their homes.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of individuals to catch thieves. They were similar to police officers and were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had expanded significantly and needed more police.

So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established with 3,000 officers. Most of these men patrolled on foot, while a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are paid quite well, and those who still ride horses earn even higher salaries than their colleagues."

Many tourists visit the Festival to see new films, plays, and listen to music from famous musicians. This year, there will be over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London.

KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim beneath the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

To catch fish, you first break the ice and make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and lower it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but after I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I have caught twenty-five! It's a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

One well-known tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. In this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures and opened a museum in Paris. Marie helped him with this work. 

In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was imprisoned. While in prison, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were quite expensive, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early models looked very different from modern bicycles. Over time, as bicycles became more affordable, more people started to buy them. Many began using bicycles to commute to work and for leisure activities. 

Today, cars are more commonly used than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to ride bicycles to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it difficult to find parking."
KET_63,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were excited to see the elephant show. We went directly to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers would give a new brush filled with paint to each elephant and take away the old one. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot outside. 

Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These groups work together to hunt for food. Lions typically inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and easily track other animals. 

All cats have excellent eyesight, which helps them catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong to succeed in hunting."

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh over 90 kilograms. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are decreasing. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches can run very fast, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around 3 years to grow into adults. They eat plants and can survive for many days without water."

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man, have climbed it. There are several routes to the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest and takes about five days. It is very popular among tourists. However, only half of the climbers who attempt to reach the top succeed. This is often due to sudden changes in the weather.

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were so polluted that many fish and insects died, leaving otters without food. However, today the rivers are clean again, and there is plenty of food for them."
KET_57,"Dear Deshini,

I am happy to have you as my new penfriend. My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. I was born in Canada, but I now live in England. Please write back and tell me about your life in India. I would love to visit one day. Do you live in a small village or a big town? What is your school like? If you have any pictures of your school, could you send them to me?

I am sending you a few photos of my family. I will send more next time I write. I hope to hear from you soon.

Tom"

Dear John,  

Thank you for helping me with my English. You are an excellent teacher. I enjoyed my time in Cambridge. Now, I am staying at my brother's apartment. He is studying to become a doctor. I will be with him for two weeks and then return home to Greece. I really like London. Yesterday, we took a bus to Regents Park. It was sunny, and we had a great time. Tonight, I will watch a film with my brother and some of his friends. I will write again from Greece.  

Best wishes,  
Kostas"
KET_42,"Dear David,

Next month, I will visit your country with two friends. We are unsure about where to stay. Are there any affordable hotels in your town? We would prefer to stay in the center. Can you help us?

Carlos

Dear Carlos,

Hotels in the center can be pricey, but I have good news. I talked to my aunt Gloria, and she said you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house! Is that okay with you?

David"
KET_59,"**Buildings**

People have always created buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. Other buildings, like museums, are used to display beautiful items. 

Many people work together to construct a building. The architect decides how the building will look and creates drawings to share their ideas. Engineers ensure that the building is strong and safe. Finally, workers carefully build it.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building known for its beautiful roof. However, it is attractive from all angles, not just the top. Another notable building is the Olympic Stadium in Munich, which has a unique roof that resembles a glass tent."
KET_54,"Indre, I need your help with something. Can you go shopping with me tomorrow? My grandmother will turn 80 next month, and she is having a party on Saturday. The issue is that I don’t have anything to wear. I have grown so much that all my trousers are too short for me! I want to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots. I don’t have a lot of money, but I think it will be enough. Would you prefer to meet in the morning or the afternoon? Please let me know. Sarika"
KET_32,"The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in southern England that are close to each other. Between these towns, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large image of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. It is not clear when the Cerne Giant was created, but many believe it was a long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the image. If you visit on May 1st at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill."
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she plans to compete in the 10,000 metres and possibly the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always smiled and laughed, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of any British woman that year.

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop due to an injury in his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail, but it’s not enjoyable for him when she runs ahead and he can't keep up. Gail trains hard, doing long runs in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. She always takes Sundays off from running. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano skills. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six years old. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef has always loved music, but he is also interested in physics and languages. Although he is very busy now, he hopes to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"**Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. His ten grandchildren do not live nearby, but they also read his stories and give their opinions on them. This feedback has helped Bill understand what young children enjoy reading.

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His favorite book is his fifth one, called *The Sheepdog*, which tells the story of a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" Last year, this book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced computer technology to make it seem like the animals were talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually feature images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many individuals send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the images are often nicer than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, and it showed a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards included images related to current events, such as accidents or visits from important people. People appreciated these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include pictures."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur because the last one died about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. The exact reason for their extinction is still unknown. Birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. 

Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were over 5,000 different types. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was about twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was smaller but much stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run quickly due to its long back legs."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can kill a person. They are skilled at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, bears do not see well, and like many animals, they use their sense of smell to find food. 

There are seven types of bears. The largest is the polar bear, which can grow to nearly three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other is found in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, not all black bears are actually black; they can be dark brown or reddish-brown. 

Many people love the black and white panda bear, which is native to China. Unfortunately, there are not many pandas left in the wild today because it is hard for them to find food."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles are found in tropical regions around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually live in slow-moving water but can swim quickly and move fast on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat a variety of things, including fish, birds, and small animals, and sometimes they even attack larger animals or people.

There are more than ten different types of crocodiles, and all of them have very sharp teeth. Although they often lose teeth, they quickly grow new ones. Crocodiles typically measure about 3.5 meters in length, but some can be much larger. They also have a long lifespan; the oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes improved significantly. In the 1950s, airplanes became much faster because they were equipped with jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, capable of flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, which means the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people would get cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, located by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, talk to their friends, walk around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same location near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
KET_48,"Dear Jeff,

I hope you are well. I am enjoying my holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and cold. Now, it has improved, and we go to the beach every day. This week, we are in Sydney, but next week we will visit the Great Barrier Reef. The water is very warm, and I really enjoy swimming there. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, and purple! Australia is truly beautiful, and we don’t want to go home! I will see you at the end of September.

Best,  
Sue"
