CPE_15,C2,"**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is similar. Rubbish bags or bins are picked up regularly by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. 
The cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfills. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A possible solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to recycle.
However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging households for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that residents had to attach to their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags were picked up during collection.
In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seemed like a good use of market forces, the authors concluded that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the workers running the program. 
Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people crammed more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfills. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs, only fell by 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing scheme, the weight also fell by 3.5%.
Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 
On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already recycling voluntarily.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount collected, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts the amount of rubbish by 0.3%. This is lower than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.
If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, richer towns tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time for recycling. 
Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily. Free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Change: Theodore Zeldin's Ideas**
Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change in the future. Do you feel respected and appreciated in your job? Simply being successful in your career is not enough anymore. Many people in different professions feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even those who are famous often feel unhappy despite their success. 
In the past, loving your job was enough to make you feel special. Now, you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, then no amount of money or status can make up for that. 
Zeldin wants to find ways for work to focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful life, help us discover new talents, and connect us with more people. However, changing this will not automatically solve unemployment. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.
Even traditional professions, like doctors and accountants, are facing challenges. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and middle managers are losing their confidence. At the same time, companies and organizations are becoming smaller. 
In Britain, only 8% of employees feel that their values match those of their organizations. Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they shape people’s lives. He is also looking at important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, he is focusing on finding better ways to earn a living.
Many experts work to improve the profits of companies, but we also need to think about ourselves as human beings and the kind of people we want to work with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us feel trapped in our jobs, unable to escape because of our qualifications and careers?
For example, in the hospitality industry, which employs 10% of the workforce, many talented people work in low-paying jobs with little respect. Hotels could be more than just places for travelers to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and connect. Hotel staff, many of whom are foreigners, often have only superficial interactions with guests. 
If hotels paid attention to their employees' ambitions, they could offer more services and create a better experience for everyone. However, they are often limited by financial concerns, focusing only on making profits. 
Zeldin believes that work is about relationships. Many people want to work in a way that allows them to express their independence. They should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues. This requires good communication skills, which are different from traditional conversations. 
Real conversations create a bond of respect and help us understand each other better. They are important for establishing equality. Every meaningful conversation can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a good outcome if conditions are right. The metaphor assumes there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.
We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Television, as a technology, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was designed to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some lesser-known alternatives to this centralized model that are worth mentioning. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateurs were active in this field. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards for television equipment and channel regulations that pushed these grassroots innovators out. This marked the end of a chance for television to develop as a more democratic form of communication in Britain.
Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the deep structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly used for public entertainment in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, most people in Britain and Germany experienced television in public settings rather than at home.
The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed. Instead, television systems based on public viewing were operating in several countries in the 1930s. However, manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of having a fully equipped home for entertainment became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.
There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, there was more centralization of power and capital, and traditional communities broke apart, leading to new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which made them feel more isolated compared to those in stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of community within the nation-state.
However, broadcasting can also be seen positively as a social form that supports democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is changing, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain centralized period of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when wanting more things becomes too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. We often hear messages like, ""If you don’t have this, you are not as good as others."" To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in ways we don’t even notice. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research centers and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living things. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature that makes us curious and eager to learn more. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in places where caves affect our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many observant people, using only their senses, helped create the field of meteorology, which has developed into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated math problems much faster than humans. Meteorology uses many technical terms that can be hard to understand for non-professionals. However, human experience is still very important in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly about theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is primarily about music, and theatre comes second. This makes sense, but I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.
At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are amazed by the talent of the musicians. A skilled singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event; we know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of actors and may not be impressed by performances that seem similar to what they could do themselves. They usually do not ask how actors remember their lines, even after a long and difficult speech. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; in fact, many people enjoy both. It suggests that audiences and performers are on more equal ground in theatre than in music, regardless of how challenging the material is.
The question is whether music can learn anything from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can, especially because I have seen how a different approach can improve the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, filled with passion, humor, sadness, and intimacy. It can connect with the audience's imagination, both individually and as a group. However, the traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and showing great respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.
On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes interrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can disrupt the flow of the entire performance. 
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a wonderful event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in different locations within a cathedral and then moved into the town. It was a high-quality musical experience where the skills and generosity of the professional musicians were central, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.
What I hope for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations. This can create surprising effects for both performers and audiences. Sometimes, this means giving up comfort; the sound might not be perfect, or it could be a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be brave as they follow artists into unexpected places.
I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that something should change in how we experience music. I can only speak as a fan: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can enjoying music. I want both to thrive and for more people to experience the joy I feel as an audience member."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I don’t really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly a problem that gets in the way between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can hide important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off you. For days, you will find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand.
**Lock and Key**  
The need for a safe home, privacy, and security has been important since people first built houses. The simple lock on a door has changed to electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations. However, people still want to keep out the “bad guys.” The idea of a lock and key is partly about feeling safe. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locks that work with smart cards. But many people do not like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of using a real key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic lock, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, art is not just about understanding; it’s about how it makes you feel. This idea is great, but it hasn’t worked for me in the past. The new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explain the artwork and its meaning. Instead of just looking at the pictures without understanding, these helpful labels made it easier for me to appreciate the art."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films usually means reducing, condensing, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It is about how each medium captures the audience's attention and the type of repetition they use.
In a novel, repetition can include reminding readers of a character's traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help readers understand better. In dialogue, we can often guess who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. Stage plays mostly consist of speech and often imitate real conversations, sometimes to the point where the dialogue seems repetitive and does not clearly communicate anything.
**Watching Movies**
When watching movies, people can feel completely absorbed in the film's world. It is an experience that takes them away from reality, at least for the duration of the film. However, when the lights come back on, the experience ends, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel responsible for the time spent watching the film, and this sense of unreality can make it hard to take movies seriously. Many from older generations, including our teachers, did not see movies as art but rather as ""mere entertainment."" They enjoyed being entertained but did not value films as an art form.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable places like the Script Department. Most rooms looked the same and were used for both official and unofficial meetings. It was hard to find a specific room without help. The studio had three main entrances, but none provided clear guidance for newcomers. Most people who worked there knew their way around, and it was assumed that they could navigate the confusing space. Thanks to their teamwork, stories of romance and adventure could reach audiences everywhere, allowing couples like Jane and George or Sally and Dick to escape their everyday lives for a few hours.
**Film-Makers**
It seems that almost everyone wants to make a movie. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and many universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that give away cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched his career as an independent director. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to make his breakthrough film before he turned 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.
In the past, when studios were in control, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers before directing their own films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to go their own way."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses were spread all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old homes made of orange brick or pale white plaster. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from a nearby factory filled the air, making it unpleasant to be outside. One common sight in that part of Norwich in the morning was a paperboy making a face as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses in the distance. 
I also have memories of my mother, who was ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and of snow falling on a big mansion at Earlham. My mother appears in these early memories, and I remember her as a small, precise woman who was often angry. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to small shops or into the city, I sensed that she was a very lonely person, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 
My mother had strict ideas about how to behave, which were not common in our neighborhood. This sometimes led to intense cleaning sessions or her telling me to ""behave properly."" I found it hard to understand her rules. For example, it meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or risking their rose bushes when walking down the street. It also meant sitting quietly at the dining table for long periods, listening to radio shows she liked. There were many rules like this.
Over time, I noticed other people in our lives. Despite her loneliness, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize they were not great company. They often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I belonged to.
I felt a heavy weight from the houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly."" It felt like my job to grow up and free myself from this weight, but it was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a clear pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and bothered your parents. I remember long, boring days playing on a rug while my mother sat in a chair, cold and distant. Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers with bikes, but mine usually let me walk with other children.
If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays. During those days, I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were just trying to take our money. She often talked about how people were only interested in money, and she had a very low opinion of politicians.
I might be exaggerating or ignoring her good qualities, but my mother did not show much kindness. However, she was aware of her role in my education. Sometimes, she would take me on the bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms filled with paintings. My mother didn’t mind this outing and even started to have opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and joking, ""Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first friends, all girls. Even though I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was clear in my memory, just like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. As I walked, I noticed that the houses changed; the porches became lower, and the front yards got smaller. 
Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how the people living there used those spaces and how they dealt with the smells of the products that used to be sold there.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick walls and large doors that used to let in curtains from the nearby train tracks. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space. He found it hard to relax or work when everything was visible. To create some separation, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic to divide the entrance area. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and led the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 
To balance the modern look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with modern chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture from his parents or things he bought at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making it hard to understand whether he was escaping or exploring. He was a talented and unique writer, known for his first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977. This book changed travel writing; it was exciting like a thriller, romantic like fiction, and insightful like great literature. However, even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction. He often changed details to make stories more interesting or to highlight deeper meanings, suggesting that travel could reveal hidden histories meant to inspire future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain, I quickly ran across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created little splashes that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the sound of birds and creating a mist over the pool, as if the water was rising to meet the sky. 
In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming back and forth in the same place. Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, which makes reality feel less real. This is why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of our world by getting off the usual paths and discovering things for ourselves. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent studies suggest he was likely wrong. Scientists, including psychiatrist John Bowlby, have shown that crying plays an important role in building the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 
Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. The sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. In early human communities, crying may have helped create trust and connections among people. 
There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for someone facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or inspiring speeches. We are also more likely to cry when watching a touching movie with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying is clear, but research on this topic is still ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect our lives? Most people know what global warming is, but few understand its consequences. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to help us produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are serious. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased gas levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge makes it hard to predict the current and future situations.
We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution.
A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These programs analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climate factors to predict past, present, and future climate conditions. However, GCMs are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only estimates, and they can be slow and expensive to run. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, even though we know it is complex.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than we have ever experienced. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the world we will live in over the next few generations. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15 to 95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 
These predictions show the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they have, and their ability to provide resources that societies depend on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many areas, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some changes may be beneficial. For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat production has increased due to climate trends, such as higher minimum temperatures leading to fewer frosts and less damage to crops.
However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed. In southern Portugal, rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter, with less in spring.
Another negative effect could be changes to glaciers, which would impact ice and vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong chance that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.
The most dramatic effect of global warming will likely be rising sea levels. This will happen because warmer water takes up more space and because of melting ice. Since about half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding is a major concern, with cities like London, New York, and Tokyo at risk of significant disruption. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, leading to millions of environmental refugees. The worst effects would be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if the worst predictions come true. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands, as well as for the countries that would need to take in those displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"**Mission to Mars**
Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. 
The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, which is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. 
It is a challenging task, but there is a race to create new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the work done will help improve future space missions."
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
The existence of art can sometimes make it harder to understand art theory. This is because art is a physical product that exists outside of us. People often think of a work of art as just a building, book, painting, or statue, separate from human experience. However, the true meaning of art comes from how it interacts with our experiences, which can make understanding it difficult.
Additionally, the perfection and long history of some artworks create standards that can block new ideas. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it seems to be removed from the human experiences that created it and the feelings it brings to life. When art is separated from its origins and its effects on our experiences, it becomes hard to see its true significance, which is what art theory tries to explain. Art then seems to exist in its own world, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.
A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of art is to reconnect the refined experiences of art with everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains relate to the earth, and similarly, art theorists must show how art relates to our lives.
To understand art better, we sometimes need to set it aside and focus on ordinary experiences that we don’t usually think of as artistic. We must take a different path to reach art theory. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about plants, but to truly understand how they grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.
To grasp the essence of art, we should start with raw experiences—those moments that catch our attention and bring us joy. However, many people have ideas that place art on a high pedestal, making them uncomfortable with the idea that they enjoy everyday activities because of their aesthetic qualities. 
Today, the arts that people enjoy the most are often not seen as traditional art forms. For example, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are popular. When people think of art as something only found in museums and galleries, they miss out on the joy found in everyday experiences. Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the idea that art is separate from ordinary life. 
The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Many people think that lions hunting together is a beautiful sight. In the fading light of sunset, a group of lions quietly moves in to catch their prey. They seem to be perfect social animals, working together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after years of studying lions in the wild, we have a different view. 
When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then working together does not always help. If one animal is too generous, it may lose out while others benefit. So, why don’t lions follow the usual rules of self-interest? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. 
It has taken various research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to find answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented band that had struggled before. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of local styles emerged. 
The album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. It featured humor and honesty, with voices that proudly showed their roots. Bedrock proved to be skilled at collecting ideas and writing songs. They wrote about traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength was in its deeper, sadder songs like ""So Low,"" which had a beautiful melody related to weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. 
The best part of ""New Life"" is its high quality - all 16 tracks are excellent, making it a standout album in an era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. In the end, he bought the last three for the full price. I understood that there was an important lesson about sales and life in this story.
I was often a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something interesting so that the other children would want to join me. It worked, and it is a lesson I have never forgotten.
When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find a topic that mattered to me. I am not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to visit. I am mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. Usually, a junior member of the editorial team or an experienced freelancer will look at it. Neither has much power, but they want to find something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced one wants to keep their job.
If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor, who will discuss it in a meeting. The editor must explain why your novel is worth accepting and whether you seem like a promising author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is important for promoting a new book. Because of this, publishers often like to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. Over half a million people were unemployed, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in work. Many people and companies around the world suffered.
Advertising professionals were not unique in losing their jobs during this time, but those who kept their jobs often felt a lot of pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping their companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. At the same time, they were asked to do more with smaller budgets. They were told that spending less could lead to better results. However, the importance of marketing was also growing. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. 
In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies have started to take marketing seriously. This has helped improve the status of marketing professionals, but it has also increased their workload. Marketing is often seen as a solution to many problems, but about half of marketing budgets go to advertising. This means that advertising professionals are under a lot of pressure to show results. 
The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economy, but there were also deeper changes happening. The recession made companies rethink their advertising budgets and question the value of advertising. Many companies wanted to know what they were getting for their money and what return they were seeing on their investments. Advertising, which has always faced skepticism, was now under even more scrutiny.
Client companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working on their accounts and to be motivated to produce excellent work. While this situation may not inspire sympathy for advertising professionals, it does mean they face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
Several factors have made effective advertising even harder to create. Some of these are due to the recession, like debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes are happening regardless of the economy, such as demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws. Additionally, some companies are now trying to advertise internationally.
These challenges have led many advertising professionals to reconsider the saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" There is now more pressure than ever to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those who want to improve is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their successful strategies private. 
As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful information, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced by advertising agencies is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was in university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Most people did not see cooking as a good job. Being a chef is often seen as hard work: the hours are long, the pressure is high, the tasks can be simple, and the pay is low. However, these reasons did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like a great way to escape the stress of university life. It offered a sense of purpose and honesty that I felt was missing in my college experience.
My wish to cook was not just a reaction to my time as a student; it also came from a love for food. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was an amazing experience. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt so grateful to the chef that I wanted to kneel down and cry. I felt happy and light for days. This experience made me want to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life into a preparation for becoming a chef. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making elaborate meals.
**Extract from a Novel**
The swimming instructor at my school was a tough ex-drill sergeant, small but strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed and bent slightly down at the front. It looked very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped into the air. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on small boats. They might eat insects if there is nothing else to eat and can live for months in uncertain conditions. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our everyday lives, and we often think of it as unimportant. We can simply return to our lives with microwaves and phones, relieved that our own risks are more predictable, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not where he feels comfortable, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a world-class sailor, but he is skilled. The main reason he sails is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing gives him exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors focus on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, a sailor can often let an autopilot take over, which may be why Raban has time to carefully watch the waves."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. There are fewer types of people than there are individuals, so in the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in having, using words we might struggle to find. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their writing, which is even more surprising if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we can escape the dullness of our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, just like when we read a great book that shows us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of details, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, the dishonesty of a friend, or a sadness we didn’t know we felt.
**Author's Note**
These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to restore parts that were cut by the editor, but I have added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. Looking back, I could have made more improvements, but that would have taken too long. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would no longer be a report of that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or anywhere else, I was there in that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already happened. This is the real story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special skills for exploring it except the price of a ticket. However, I don’t believe all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term appeared in the early 1980s, showing a rise in environmental awareness and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through Australian gorges. Any tour that involves cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make informed choices, the lack of rules and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn’t as helpful as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another and often staying for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I added many warnings. But then I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a new idea that developed because of capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their studies in the 16th and 17th centuries when trade and markets began to grow. As societies became more complex, populations grew, and new technologies for making different types of clothing were created, the meanings of what we wear also became more complicated. Because of this, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means today. For instance, a man's suit, which seems to be a sign of uniformity, can mean very different things in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Reports in newspapers about publishers fighting over popular new books can give a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to earn a living. The smartest writers work full-time jobs and write in the evenings, so they have a backup plan if their book is not quickly published or made into a movie. Others, like me, take on various small jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places we were performing in across the country started to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our supporters at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of all our needs. Although I still felt shy, it was mixed with a strange, naive confidence that only people who are usually shy and suddenly become famous can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to fewer live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for professional musicians.
It is clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. On a national level, no important state event happens without music. For individuals, music offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play musical instruments.
I believe that people will continue to want to learn instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is a part of measuring intelligence. While these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus better, especially those with behavioral issues.
Current research is also looking into how playing an instrument might help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice can help create good study habits and focus, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.
What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I believe two things are likely to happen. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music. This will make it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills, but it may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If this vision for the future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and how progress is measured to stay relevant for a wider audience.
Training for musicians will be essential. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a big change from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 
Positively, this change will allow those involved in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the importance of music itself. Music is vital in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession needs to work together to ensure this changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, actors face criticism and disrespect. Much of this negative opinion comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often use boring clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when it is performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and unimportant. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the writer's ideas. After a play ends, they feel empty until they perform again, and this emptiness shows in discussions about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet shows a young man caught between being a boy and a man. His acting is simple yet confident. He skillfully handles the text and shows great control over his body and emotions. Lester portrays Hamlet as a young man filled with anger but also humor, making him both strong and likable. His physical presence, like the way his arms hang, suggests he is waiting to be brought to life. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that also feels like he is moved by an inner force.
**What is Acting?**
Acting raises questions about behavior. Is acting just copying real behavior, or does it create something new? What gives life to the characters on stage? These are important questions in the world of theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director's rehearsal process starts with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find the right moment to speak. For example, if the line is about remembering a rainy night spent queuing, the actor should breathe and let the memory come to them. They might picture a queue at a bus stop or a concert. The director encourages actors to be open-minded and trust that something will happen during the rehearsal.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make the audience feel that their presence matters. Attending a live performance should feel special, and the staff should share this feeling. It can be uncomfortable if the staff seem uninterested. The theatre should create a connection between the performers and the audience. The audience should be close enough to hear and see everything clearly. The design of the auditorium is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the space is too big, it can feel wrong because drama is about human experiences. Many theatres built in the late 1800s got this right by creating spaces that feel welcoming. 
When attending a play, the audience wants to see something surprising and unique. If it is predictable, they might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly popular among young people, but it also had a big effect on the middle class and older adults. This music opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it with excitement, knowing that this unique sound would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential for many young rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool listening to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to make the next big move for a teenager who loved rock and roll: creating his own music.
**Snow**
I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to climb out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books that try to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of mystery about how researchers analyze their findings. To help with this, we invited different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to talk about their methods. The goal was to share insights about the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in various styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 
Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. 
Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach our children is fine, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people did not like this change, seeing the newcomers as rude. However, they eventually accepted that success was important. In Hollywood, success is measured by how much money a film makes. 
Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. 
Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films. People talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the main place for anyone in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 19th century as a new way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography allowed them to do this. The combination of light, lenses, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took much longer to create. 
This new art form surprised other artists. At first, they were happy about it, but then they claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on machines. They believed that true art came from human creativity. 
Despite the criticism, photographers knew they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists used brushes and pencils to show their view of the world, nature, and people.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book needed illustrations. This was also true for many novels for older readers, although fewer were published over time. Children's publishing was mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality works, but the best artists always gave their best effort. 
The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable works, making it a great place for research and discovery. The best illustrations will likely be shown to the public again, either through new editions of classic books or exhibitions of original artwork. There are signs that interest in this period of illustration is growing, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations, either by reprinting them or creating new editions using the original art."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with Caution**
Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts that tell people where you are. The message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that while sharing online can be exciting, it can also have negative effects.
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to fame and wealth. However, we often dive into this world without thinking about the risks, sharing personal stories and photos without realizing how crowded and dangerous it can be.
But there is hope. The early internet users, known as bloggers, have already faced these challenges. They explored the internet before social media existed, experiencing both the good and bad sides of sharing online. Their experiences can teach us valuable lessons.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by researchers and students at that time. He saw a chance to share his life and created a personal blog filled with stories and pictures. In 1996, he began posting daily, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything, and while some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the art in his work.
However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to remove the blog, feeling that sharing so much made people distrust him. This shows that while sharing online can be fun, it can also lead to disappointment.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, who worked in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job, but one day, a colleague shared her blog with the company's executives, including those she had criticized. As a result, she lost her job. This situation highlights the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, we should think carefully before we share."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Tiredness is often seen as a common problem in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. 
One important idea is that ""People need more sleep,"" according to a leading sleep researcher. Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic. Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he allowed participants to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing they needed more rest.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, such as how tiredness affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour to change their sleep patterns as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator where participants are asked to drive while answering questions. They always come in at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after a poor night’s sleep. As they drive, one participant tries hard not to fall asleep. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he falls asleep for a few seconds, causing the car to drift off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay awake and drive safely for at least half an hour. She also recommends energy products like tablets and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
What do we know for sure about human sleep? Like other mammals, humans sleep in a daily cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Scientists believe that sleep helps repair body tissues and muscles, but it is unclear if this happens faster during sleep or while we are awake and relaxed. 
Research shows that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, although the reasons are not fully understood. Some researchers even say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt.""
Sleep patterns have changed over time. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. 
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, wealthy people began to adopt the sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later forced most people to work longer hours in lighted buildings. However, in many non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They might sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noises from animals and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"We are talking about really big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots, which cost 800 dollars each, on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I was not one. I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains and realized I did not belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy arriving from the sky. But that thought disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a worn-out bag. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and walked out without saying anything.
I thought there should be some clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But now, I couldn’t do it anymore. I wondered what I should do next. A racing driver should have other options for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but they just vanished when I tried to reach for them.
One idea was to be a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me for that job. Another idea was to sell classic cars, but that didn’t work out either. I spent a lot of time on phone calls, lunches, and meetings, but nobody was buying old cars that year. So, I decided to step back before I lost everything.
Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, people would only listen for a short time before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I really miss the excitement of driving a powerful racing car. I miss the thrill of going from zero to 150 miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing.
I miss the bright, interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous had its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to tell their friends they knew me. Young boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. But now that I don’t race anymore, things are different. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have a lot of free time now. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I saw some small brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped the city improve. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I don’t think that’s the main reason. It is more likely that, in our work, we try hard to make our writing very effective, so we lose the natural feeling of writing a letter. A true artist, who does not focus on making their writing perfect (even if they rewrite many times), does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is what makes someone a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the use of long words made them powerful and showed he was a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. You could always expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, so having a celebrity is no longer necessary. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, older people waiting in line didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived late."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement. However, it was not a big success at the box office. The film was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the person it was based on, might do to them. It was only later, when it was shown on television, that people started to appreciate it. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of experience; he didn’t know what he could or couldn’t do, so he just went for it. He also had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took this opportunity with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel nodded but seemed distant, as if she didn’t really understand. Dermot asked her, “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back and said, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.
**Title Race**
“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator), but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how a single photo could capture the spirit of a place, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. My rule was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep looking for new shots. 
I had a moment of success when a photo I took of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was just luck, but they say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photos, and I was getting paid for it, which I thought was good.
The assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice payment for capturing the beauty of my city in different seasons. I knew that some of my best work would be ignored because it was just a picture book, not something meant to challenge people’s views.
After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t need to know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things were not going well for me at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great.
They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it had been a busy and hot trip, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs, I felt excited. I was ready to take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to enjoy the atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, just like the grand buildings from the old empire that shaped the city. I didn’t want to see what Schussner had done in other seasons; I wanted to create my own version of Vienna.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time, observing everything until I was ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz look beautiful and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was huge and heavy in the center of the city. I realized I might have to take a partial shot instead. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the science behind it. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art**
Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been an important but often overlooked theme in creative work during this time. 
The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, organized by curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for many years. The artworks are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering and connecting ideas on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it shows themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's lively personality and humor, which makes him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks serious purpose? 
Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. But others argue that his popularity does not mean his work is unimportant. Hockney himself understands his limitations and believes it is not fair to judge his art based on traditional ideas of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and knows that only future generations can truly judge his work.
**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others not so good. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a specific idea, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, and we notice new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, though, it feels forced or questionable. 
As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. Together with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse for an exhibition called ""Window-shopping."" This show featured individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera until it broke, creating a flickering image on a monitor. These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other in their differences. 
I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is an individual activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their experience. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. 
Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we are experiencing. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our enjoyment is not simple. How we feel and recognize beauty is influenced by our society and its values. 
While we should appreciate our instinctive responses to art, the belief that thinking about art takes away from our enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as something separate from thought."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow pebble on the riverbed. This pebble did not feel like stone, but it was beautiful. This could be how gold first entered the lives of early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they began to search for copper ores and ways to extract copper from them. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.
**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, struggling with our heavy bags against strong winds and trying to avoid icy waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the cottages by the water were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With dark clouds gathering, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced wars and droughts are long gone. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are now forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or the population and observe how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this trick every time the stranger tried to approach. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while walking across the open ground himself.  
**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the village of Felmersham, people collected information about what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America estimated that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide places for birds to nest, keeping their population above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.  
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who often sleep near their owners, slowly leave their resting place to go to the reed beds. They take their time, groaning about the hard day ahead. Eventually, the leader steps into the water, and the others follow. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but soon they are swimming, barely keeping their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on the green shoots they can reach.  
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping shapes and soft colors that create a calm underwater feeling. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes and the chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life. In this short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small things. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of space, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The first known images date back to about 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans created cave paintings. They might have recorded real hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply made daily life more colorful. These early images are deeply connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera worked like the human eye, capturing images that looked very similar to what we see in real life. This ability to fix images chemically allowed photography to capture natural moments.
At the same time, photography was seen as a sophisticated art form, producing images that artists had worked hard to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photo of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we must consider how much photography can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural rules like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey reality? Photography is often seen as a convincing form of evidence, making it easy to confuse our view of the world with its photographic representations. For instance, it is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""This is my grandson.""
Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people view it have changed a lot. This change may be partly because photography has moved into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once close to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often tell us more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not only reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our homes."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. It is important to be creative, but one wrong move can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best way to learn is through reading a lot, writing often, and letting your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t become chaotic. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can express their feelings through writing during tough times. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration to strike. All approaches are valid, as long as they are not just following strict rules. The key is to find your own voice and nurture it, allowing it to grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it is important not to have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to explain something important. A memory from the main character can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different perspectives quickly, keeping the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn’t mean you should just summarize the story. The conflict and action in a short story should be as strong as in a novel, but every word must be meaningful in a shorter format.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. Most players make mistakes along the way. We may not know everything, but we understand enough to play. We can sometimes see a few moves ahead, and that feels good. As we learn more about chess, we realize that it is more about long-term strategy than just short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, not just individual moves. In both chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand the complexities involved.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally want to communicate, as seen in how children talk. However, no child is born knowing how to write. Charles Darwin pointed out that while speaking is instinctive, writing is not. Language exists in all cultures, past and present. Although languages change, they do not necessarily become better. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they are together without a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and started as simple codes that improved over time. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. A group of children is unlikely to create an alphabet on their own. Children are naturally good at listening and speaking, but learning to read and write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write down what I know.
To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that the way he lives and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book.
I believe my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same liberty that historians do by putting words into the mouths of my characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would not be as effective if told in a simple way. I want my book to be enjoyable to read, and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make it so. A smart reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.
Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe you can only really know those from your own country. People are shaped by many things: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. All these experiences make them who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live through those experiences yourself. Because you can only know people from a different country through observation, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen through my own perspective, just like my main character."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those living in it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important writers. Right now, there is a complex mix of different styles of poetry, groups of poets, and ways to present, criticize, and teach poetry. There are also different opinions about what a poet's role in society should be.
In general, the current discussion in poetry is about the distrust between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work in front of an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in village halls or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students, and arts festivals often include poetry readings by well-known poets.
These events have many effects, and it is unclear how they benefit poets. For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed live, public readings are very helpful. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique become clear.
On the other hand, poets who are serious about their craft aim to create deep and meaningful work. They try to express strong emotions and ideas in a small space and use varied rhythms. Unfortunately, these poets may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that they might only read their simplest poems to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best work.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this approach has its challenges. It is unrealistic to think that a person's story is a perfect reflection of their past. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final result is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may affect how the informant shares their memories. Historians must recognize their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories may be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings of nostalgia or resentment about their past. These emotions can make the testimony seem more convincing, but they may not accurately represent the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence that behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs studying a few species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these two areas are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. For example, trying to explain how a bird builds a nest by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge: they must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on different parts of social life, uses specific methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius defined architecture as involving order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provided Greek terms for some of these concepts, likely based on earlier Greek writings that we no longer have. While utility and function are not part of his definition, Vitruvius does discuss the best designs for different types of buildings later in his work. Initially, he emphasizes the artistic side of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early buildings were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural ideas. Despite how elaborate classical temples may seem, they essentially started as simple, single-room huts."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled of sulphur. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week. They planned to leave early in the morning and return by midday so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her worries, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted that Mui didn’t trust her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily even passed a couple of slow cars with great skill, which made Mui keep quiet. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street near the sea that had many empty spaces. She wasn’t sure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. 
Lily noticed her sister’s worried face in the driving mirror. She thought it was better not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don’t worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily told Chen he was ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too proud. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee, their son, to look at the grey sea. He held Man Kee close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers, which he struggled with, and to grow up to own many restaurants.
As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and happiness while thinking about Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship shining in the sunlight. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he finally spotted it. It was a small, old tramp steamer. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special ship for people like us. It may look small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui joined them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I once read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket away from the wall. As soon as it was free, I fell into the well. I hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I felt dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say.
You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle’s main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. My mother and father appeared with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming, and my father was shouting for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a mix of excitement and fear.
Then I noticed the drops of dirty well water I had left behind, forming a small pool at my feet. I looked back into the courtyard, where my father was shining a flashlight down into the well. I couldn’t believe no one had seen the drops. My mother was now screaming in a way I had never heard before, and it shook me. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank was turning into something that could lead to serious trouble for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 
Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I took a deep breath and said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat. I claimed I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father appeared in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed, and I realized I was only making things worse. I said the secret passage had collapsed after me and that the well was dangerous. I looked into my father’s eyes and felt like I was looking into a dark tunnel with no way out. 
He said, “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” with more disappointment than I had ever felt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, looking troubled. He didn’t feel sorry for me because I had a scary adventure, but because he could see through my lie. He worried about what kind of person I would become if I kept lying. His pity hurt me more than my father’s words. It made me realize that both my actions and my father’s reaction were serious, and I couldn’t ignore them."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The moving van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, with his big fingers, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that looked over a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there felt present in the air, like dust.
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, being bossy and insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.
Fred noticed Susan was not crying and said, ""That's something."" Curious, Susan asked, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You'd be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They are fine once they get to the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""
Susan could understand that feeling. If she had been alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' job to notice any problems. The piano was now the last item to be moved, sitting proudly in the best room of the house.
Sitting on the bottom stair, since all the chairs were gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours to get it up. Little Robert watched in excitement while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't!"" They had to find a way to get it inside because Francesca was meant to be a concert pianist.
Eventually, Peter, her late husband, solved the problem. They left the piano in the garden while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. Then, a crane was borrowed from a local farmer to lift the piano through the window. The children were overjoyed to see it come in, but it cost a lot of money, and they had to wait months to have it tuned.
""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children became too busy to visit on weekends, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and how the banister rails were still not fixed perfectly. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but now it was too late. 
Suddenly, Fred asked, ""Are you all right?"" He reminded her that the piano was the last thing to move. Susan felt nervous as she moved away from the stairs. Robert and Francesca appeared to watch. Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Susan was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. 
Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing together, relieved that it was over. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that became available to everyone: literary criticism. 
By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions and rate books with up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This helped Amazon fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, instead of just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.
Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted every day, making it hard to check them all. A team of editors looked for reviews that followed Amazon's rules, such as no one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to misbehave.
For example, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive ones anonymously to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews.
Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a special link. Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments were really from the authors, except for well-known writers. 
When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press. But many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as good for business. 
Amazon monitored reviews closely, especially for bestsellers, to ensure they followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping* inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, but such silliness was rare.
Most reviewers on Amazon took their writing seriously, and their reviews often provided a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This shows that making literary criticism available to everyone is a positive change."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say that some artists have gone too far, claiming that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these opinions for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to always be new and different. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes and methods that are still present in today’s art.
We expect artists to be different from ordinary people, with special talents that make them stand out. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work on their own and sometimes get frustrated if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I want to describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book that talks about the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then simply states, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This may sound childish, but stay with me. 
After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and then to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the text on the canvas in a simple way, without any fancy designs. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in plain black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: is this finished piece a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find success in one style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep producing similar work, and if they try something new, it can upset the audience. Gallery owners prefer to play it safe, and perhaps art buyers feel more comfortable with familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully broken this rule. 
Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying to change his style. He is moving away from the still lifes that made him famous to focus on the London Underground. Rimmington finds the railway fascinating. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore what happens underground. His new exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique charm of this hidden world designed for people on the move.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old woman who comes from the village each day to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories.
I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The true comfort of my work as an artist lies in the fact that, in the quiet moments of painting or writing, I can rearrange reality and show its deeper meaning. Our everyday actions often hide the true beauty of life. For artists, creating art allows us to deal with the pain and challenges of daily life, not to escape from them, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice with him, had just picked me and my trunk from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford."" 
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. 
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!"" 
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you are good at talking, and you enjoy performing."" 
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 
""Be that as it may,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart is not in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I could see many career options, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the talent - the brains, the courage, the vision."" 
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice hated the business. 
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I had taken care of him since we were kids. It was not hard because I loved him. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and went to parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businessmen - and our home was always lively with good conversations. 
""I tell you what,"" my father said, continuing our talk. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" 
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 
So it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 
In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 
But then my father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last important task for him, the biggest project the family business had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my time. 
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 
I could tell my father didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever how focused and determined he was, how he approached his work with energy and control. In his way, he was a kind of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important. 
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning a house that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had been successful at work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency two months after having twins and received a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. She strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a good address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Lois felt that even saying the name of their old flat lowered her status.
Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport. Since her office was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to travel by tube. The crowded journey made him feel resentful and unhappy. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. He remembered the smell of dinner and how his grandmother cared for his grandfather after a long day at work. She was a supportive lawyer's wife, always present at legal events and seemingly happy with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were essential for their lifestyle. Their home, the au pair, and everything depended on both of their incomes. Now, their hard work could be ruined by Venetia, who seemed to be in a bad mood.
Venetia must have come straight from court, and she was furious. Someone had pushed her to her limit. Simon blamed himself for not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened. He remembered every word of her angry accusations. She said, ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he bribed three jurors. You did nothing. Is that true?"" Simon replied, ""He's lying. It isn't true."" She continued, ""He also said he gave shares in his company to your fiancée before the trial. Is that true?"" Again, Simon insisted, ""He's lying. None of it is true."" His denial felt instinctive but unconvincing, and he felt guilty. The shock on his face turned to shame, reminding him of the fear he felt in his headmaster's office. He looked into Venetia's eyes and saw her disbelief.
If only he had been prepared. He now knew what he should have said: ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. He will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who made Venetia the judge of their legal practice? Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was unsure of what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t care about the worn-out rented houses, messy gardens, or old furniture. However, I was wrong. People in the shops, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some herbs to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive.
“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She is a writer with several unpublished stories, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness sake! In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies, then continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. She knocks on my door. “So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you.” She sits in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should’ve gone into teaching. Writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither.
“So, what are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel overwhelmed by the empty days ahead. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum, walks to the shops, and sitting alone in the park. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” My heart races as I ask. “Of course I will,” Jaz says, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction.
“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my work so far?” Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning her manuscripts. I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, surprised. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good. A little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz replies, acting like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say. My advice sounds a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but then I suddenly remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She used to wink at us and say, “I’ve had my moments.” We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, we also have a need to learn about our broader history to understand our future, both as individuals and as a nation. Heritage helps us feel a sense of continuity; knowing about the past can give us confidence about the future. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being. It influences our customs and material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these oral traditions have been lost. Now, we often look to places and buildings to understand our past. It is very important to preserve these connections as a way to honor our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England called the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people asked me why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about this area. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed flat and empty, which provided a good setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not really flat or empty. They are uniquely English but also strangely different. It is surprising that there is a place in the middle of England that many people find unfamiliar, especially since many other areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, seemingly simple yet deeply mysterious. While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively, as I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict facts. However, trying to imagine the Fens is important because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant just putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility should mean more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and create emotional connections. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and they have started offering similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects, not replicas. They exist to provide a genuine experience with history. They show items that were used and had meaning at some point in time. This is their strength and what makes them different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that meet this challenge and create exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by increasing interest in real historical experiences.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and on a large scale, affecting many people. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of our towns today and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more likely to value preservation than earlier generations because stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not a problem if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity', which are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experiences. 
Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thinking, a revolution that started modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer description of the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won awards because we thought they would be boring. Our mother often criticized us for this attitude, but our father would give us small coins as rewards for reading better books. He would also include some interesting books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we thought most of his choices were 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some good short stories and, once, to a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous.' This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad. Early humans, who lived in dangerous places with wild animals, made desperate noises, and some of these sounds are still present in words today, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" and the Latin word 'mors' meaning ""death"". 
Many people avoided discussing the origin of language because they thought it was a topic for odd theories. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"**Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. There are strict deadlines and limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only read for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Often, both the public and the writers believe that people only write reviews because they need money. Another reason might be that writers cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book, so they do reviews instead.
However, writing reviews is a skilled job that requires different abilities. Writing a short review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a longer review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine, which is about fifteen hundred words, has challenges from both short and long formats. 
Reviewers must also think about their audience. Some readers may only skim the review, while others may be very interested and want a detailed analysis. Additionally, a reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.
The American novelist John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews when he is not working on his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in those reviews.
I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been in academia, and most of my serious books are academic, which professors are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study. It is common for the same people to do both. The time has passed when other academics criticized professors for writing reviews, thinking it was a waste of time or not dignified. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking away their opportunities are also less common now, partly because there are many more reviews available, so almost anyone can write one.
I believe this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about, and professors benefit because writing reviews helps them stay connected to the public. It also reminds them that they need to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may use complex language when talking to each other, they should make sure to be understandable when addressing a wider audience.
In conclusion, despite its importance, reviewing is usually a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes hit him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. 
He thought he should worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, looking either independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. 
There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were intact and nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened. From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. 
Once he left the busy office and started his bus ride home, he no longer wanted to be alone, even though he often thought he did. Sitting at his desk, he craved solitude and time to himself, but when he finally escaped, he felt empty. He suspected that the work he did, which didn’t suit him, was changing him and pulling him away from who he really was. 
As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he began to wonder for whom he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and his thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself but found that he only wanted to get by. 
He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they rushed toward their goals, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He went to one job interview, feeling grateful, but didn’t think to question the job itself, which was a vague editorial position at a local newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he was surprised when Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied. Ralph took this as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It was not as fancy as regular racecourses, but it was similar because people lined up on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. It was a challenge to keep a few selected goats in line, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our flashlight batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. We realized we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. We kept moving forward.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and my confidence? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many leaders are expected to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help you think of difficult questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will just get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some things can be done faster, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math in your head. But other things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need results"" can be unhelpful, just like trying to get a good night's sleep in a short time. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are sayings that reflect this: ""He who hesitates is lost,"" and ""Look before you leap."" Both are true.
Generally, the mind has three different speeds of processing information. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to help me stay safe. It was only after that I realized what had happened. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also does not have time to think about their next move. This quick reaction can be called our ""wits.""
The second speed is thought itself. This involves reasoning, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this type of intelligence, which we often call ""intellect."" People who are good at solving these problems are seen as ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and can be playful or dreamy. In this mode, we think things over or reflect. For example, sitting on a rock by the sea, listening to the waves, or being half-asleep puts us in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ones. Allowing our minds to wander is not a luxury; it is necessary, especially when life gets busy. We need both the quick mind and the slow mind.
Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some complex issues can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that slower, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complicated situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday is usually straightforward. But when we are unsure about what to consider or which questions to ask, we need to use our slow mind. 
If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it may be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less direct ways of thinking. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than quick thinking."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. We form a close community where everyone helps each other. My school French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details of the language, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a big problem for me, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, and I felt anxious when I spoke. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes from losing the social confidence I used to have when I could speak easily.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely but did not want to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, he sent me a note asking me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting. Instead, he focused on the photography and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people react to the film itself, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made well, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius craftsman who loved to hear the audience scream. He did not deal with guesses or complex ideas, and he did not explore his characters deeply. He focused on film itself and the precise beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment that you can buy. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we create almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities 50 years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with trails from airplanes that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do, options to choose from, and opportunities available. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology makes everything change faster. New products come out quickly, and before you know it, another one is already on the way. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in our economy, having too many choices can cause stress, take up time, and make life more complicated. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" – the simple things that bring meaning to our complex lives. However, simplifying life is not easy in a world with so many options. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we really need, and more software updates and plans than we can keep track of.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. We are a special group of guests at McAndrews: old-fashioned and perhaps a bit snobbish. I dislike the bad manners of shop assistants today, which some people think is fair treatment. I also don’t like the overly friendly behavior of waiters who seem to want to treat guests like friends. I know the names of many other guests because, like me, they have been coming here since childhood. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings and nothing more. This respect for privacy and dignity is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is a mistake, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include the one where Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to feel emotional during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the deep interior, life does not exist—except for a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the coming years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the search for knowledge is important, and we want to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to focus on whether what scientists do is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very important and satisfying. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and put them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or a tin of soup. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can make a tasty dessert in just five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your food with others. Sharing meals is important to our human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would want to discuss business over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he would organize them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and journals were close to new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and neatness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and seemed to think, ""No way am I going in there."" She went into his apartment, which was her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson thought he was someone from another world, not from her familiar streets of Brooklyn.
**KAREN**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story and identity. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The golf club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small blessings, she realized she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to know something important in a small community, where her life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sadness for Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly throat problems. Miss Fogerty believed his best quality was making patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, which earned him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be impressed by her performances. Watching her play the piano with great skill is exciting. However, at a recent concert for kids, one small boy surprised her. After watching her play many different styles of music, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This request made Joanna laugh. She realized that, to him, she was not a real pianist until she played that song. Of course, she played it and enjoyed the moment.
Joanna is different from many famous pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published a beginner's piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She managed to write this book despite her busy schedule, which includes many music festivals and collaborations with other artists. 
Many people are surprised that she took on the extra work of writing a book. Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. She thinks that most people are not interested in becoming great musicians but just want to enjoy music. This idea is what drives her to help children learn.
Joanna has a lot of experience teaching beginners. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many children how to play the piano. She also grew up in a home where her mother taught piano, and many kids came to learn. This experience taught her that music should be available to everyone, not just those with special talent.
She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speaking a little French. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to perform like the talented children they see on TV.
Joanna worries that some parents use music to push their children to achieve, instead of letting them enjoy it. She thinks this pressure can make kids stop playing because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.
When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good enough, Joanna is careful with her words. She does not want to criticize others. Instead, she believes her colorful and engaging books are just one option among many that can help children enjoy learning.
To make her books interesting, she includes stories and music on CDs. This way, children can have fun while learning. For kids whose parents do not play the piano, the music is recorded on the CDs. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. She encourages children to improvise and explore the piano.
As children progress, they need to learn to read music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. 
She knows it can be hard to get children to practice, but she suggests that they should have clear goals. Joanna also shares tips for practice: play through the whole piece, even with mistakes, and mix difficult pieces with easier ones. 
In the end, Joanna wants to help children enjoy music and learn to play the piano in a fun and engaging way."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find that the time they spend fixing mistakes on a computer is about the same as the time they would have spent writing by hand. 
Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, many people now write love letters through email, which is a positive change. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often do not realize the power of writing and may exaggerate their messages. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and carefully handed him the disc. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be played to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people believe that electronic text is a change as important as the invention of printing, but they forget that real changes in how we think take a long time. 
For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often a frustrating experience, so most people do not do it. Computers encourage people to read only parts of texts. Some people claim that this leads to new ways of storytelling, but many books have always been read in a non-linear way. What is new is that computers do not encourage reading a text from start to finish.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered it from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being put away. Twelve years of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work.""
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He could not imagine a computer or any other machine in this space, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had discussed this many times over the two years they had known each other. She could never understand why he resisted technology, even though he was skilled with computers and had published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard, she could create new software that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot things because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being overwhelmed with work and struggling to find a parking spot in the mornings.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by commissioning books from him. Ian was known for being unpredictable, and Lancelot felt that he was becoming even more difficult to work with.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, Ian's manuscript would not be ready anytime soon. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that Ian was known for, and it felt like it had lost its original purpose. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, but in that case, the payments were small amounts that had never been given. Ian had received a huge advance, which went against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.
Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed less motivated than them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. For some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew even more. At the height of his influence, he was already known to be difficult to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but it only created stories about how much he was paid, which kept increasing in hopes of getting him to produce more work.
At editorial meetings, Ian would criticize others' ideas sharply. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for important events. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new idea in England. You rarely find descriptions of breakfast in medieval literature. There are some mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone, not just the rich. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal first thing in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For example, a casual reader of a newspaper usually understands the photographs printed in it. However, instead of just accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly shows what the scene looked like at that moment. Does it express the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal and put everything else aside. Sports can be tough, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve personal success, but you should always remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot to enjoy these benefits.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory so clearly that they become special moments we remember well. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a beautiful musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying a stunning live performance. I reacted with joy as I listened to its incredible variations until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether they love, fear, or admire them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports.
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Some see the wren as a sign of something important, while others think it is just a bird that is lost. Both ideas could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction a wren flew could tell them about their luck. Today, wrens are still seen in art and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about them have faded, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels empty and sad.
This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way of understanding the importance of different animals. However, these beliefs can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once admired in London for taking bread from children. But soon, people saw them as pests and they disappeared from many areas, except Wales. Now, red kites are valued again and are being protected and reintroduced to help them thrive.
Our connection with birds goes back to the early days of humanity. The first birdwatchers paid close attention to birds because they could warn of danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected people to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, and our interest in them reflects our own identity in nature.
Some people think our feelings for birds are outdated and no longer useful. But just like certain body parts, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be difficult. This is why birds are now seen as signs of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we might lose these birds but also because it represents a loss of culture. Birds carry deep meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize different kinds of love and magic. Many people feel sad about losing these birds, especially those mentioned in famous poems and stories.
However, the loss of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. Folklore is important because it includes stories and legends that connect us to the past. These stories create a stronger bond with birds than scientific facts do. They evoke feelings that are often hidden in our busy lives. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to describe, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their significance.
The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a rich history, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps us curious."""
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring was more about how easy it was to travel through the land than about the actual distance. 
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often just as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not always show true directions. 
In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or simple symbols, and their size showed how important they were. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and location, so it is important to understand the specific style used in early maps.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and the amount of information included on maps. To achieve this, cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences. For example, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, they began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.
As explorers learned more about the world, they tried to create maps of what they knew. Astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to better mapping techniques. 
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land for military purposes. This led to the creation of contour maps. Later, archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had their own specific needs for maps.
Today, cartographers create maps that show various types of information, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has led to a new era in cartography.
It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change, with old ideas sometimes existing alongside new ones. Cartographers have often had to wait for better tools before they could use their new ideas. Since it is easier to copy old maps, and because map publishers can be resistant to change, we should not blindly trust maps as the latest knowledge.
The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide a valuable record of human history, which makes studying historical cartography both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on nice wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting school. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the famous composer Richard Rodgers. 
I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. If I had failed, it might have felt like a big deal, but I didn’t think it would be life or death. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. 
As he played songs from the many shows he had created at school, I remembered some of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist, and I didn’t have much to show him except for my praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written with an unknown pop group. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but I thought I had met someone special who would succeed in musical theatre very soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. 
The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I felt about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs, but it was likely I would finish my exams and become a lawyer by twenty-five. My father believed I would grow out of pop music by twenty-one, which worried me because that meant I only had a few months left to enjoy it. But I thought it would be fun to see Andrew again, to go to a musical with him, and to write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. 
I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I often doubted things. His talent was clear, and he claimed to have many important contacts. Soon, I was back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t excite me much. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's famous show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music was contagious and somewhat justified. 
What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for many years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place, there is room for another. We could be the second hamburger place. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which were likely thought up by his school friend who had tried writing before. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of lyrics for the musical. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that day marked a change in my career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species that has a special ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so important in human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a genius spider and does not require special education or skills in building.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly caused by the air around us, greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. Climate can strongly influence the appearance of landscapes. For example, warm and wet conditions all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things. The daily weather patterns that create the climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement happens because the air rests on a spinning Earth. Since air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, the sun is a more important cause of air movement.
**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days training to make coffee, learning a lot about how to clean and maintain the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making a perfect, rich cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was not as easy as it seemed, and I thought I might have to go back to simple tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for the camera because it can show the entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are very few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of these arts. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he has almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art style that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to go at your own pace. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is known as ""The Sailing Capital of the World"" for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes.
Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. However, many cyclists find these bikes too expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for regular cyclists. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell bike frames.
The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community than a traditional business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a reasonable price. 
As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create solid joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with thicker bamboo, then move on to the thinner parts for the seat and chain. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process requires careful cutting and technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help and check our work.
Many participants are engineers, and the chance to build the bike themselves is a big draw. Ian reassures us that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s okay to try again. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, allowing us to focus on the bike's design, choosing from plain bamboo, black, or mottled finishes.
On Sunday, we spend time building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique. James and Ian believe that the individuality of each bike is important. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. 
When I test James's bike, I find it light, stiff, and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James says that while some people enjoy building the bike, the real joy comes from riding it. Bamboo bikes are light and fun to ride, and they cost less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-Help Books**
Diane Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I looked at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very wealthy, and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's small book about improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry. This industry tries to meet many people's desires for self-improvement, but it also creates new desires and supports the publishing industry in New York. 
In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many books that are not very good, but there are even worse ones. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected because they are too similar to others or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often not a priority. What matters most is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions. She admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there should be an understanding between the writer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this understanding is often not fully respected. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They might feel ashamed of certain actions or thoughts, or they might think some things are not important enough to share. 
Sometimes, writers may feel that they can express the truth better by inventing stories rather than sticking strictly to the facts. They might call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe they are reading true events, even if the story is mostly fiction. This can happen without any intention to deceive.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Students of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A detective story often symbolizes deeper human feelings like lust or greed, and solving the crime represents restoring order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt and false. 
In his tales, the detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. The detective understands the criminal, and they share a strange connection. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. He is both a criminal and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels guilty about his role, and this can make him more determined to punish the wrongdoers.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best science writers today. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable in such a fancy place. Gould said he couldn’t write well in such an environment. He believes that understanding the culture is essential for a successful writer. Science is its own world, and only those who are part of it can explain it well. 
One of Gould's main ideas is to never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language but must never change the main idea. If readers feel that you are talking down to them, they will lose interest."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To handle the unusually high temperatures this summer, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic. This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It has become a common part of our lives, showing how we can control the climate, or at least change it. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can make a big difference and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming more interested in sundials, which are tools that tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were very important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just decorations in gardens. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago. There, serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with careful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this experience, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure did not mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they did not question the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, when they learned they would be staying in the hotel for their entire holiday, they became worried.
""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""And we can take a boat to Interlaken."" 
Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 
""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 
""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 
""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds..."" 
""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake,"" Keith repeated. The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 
Dawne then said, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 
""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen at Gatwick. 
""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 
""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" 
Again, Dawne mentioned the travel agency and described the bald clerk. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 
""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 
Keith was impatient and wanted to speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" 
""I counted you, although you probably didn't see me,"" Mrs. Franks said. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 
""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But that couldn't happen."" 
""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 
""Let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 
""She seems kind,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane. 
""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked very old. She said they had the best night's sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 
""That's nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that it was ironic they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people when the whole point of their holiday was to escape from the needs of older people. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the Endurance are being published, and the American Museum of Natural History is preparing a big exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about Shackleton's life.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and find lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become an example for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workers have to be let go."" While it may seem hard to connect Shackleton's survival skills in extreme cold to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership qualities. Shackleton had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, including their lives.
One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" 
From the diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. He thought things through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans if something was not working. MacGregor says they have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's story that clients can relate to without feeling criticized.
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical strength, and patience. MacGregor notes that one of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to be patient, especially in America, where people often want quick solutions. For example, if you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it is better to wait it out rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, if a new product is not selling well, it is important to change plans instead of continuing to sell it.
Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another time, during a 1905 expedition when they were near starvation, Shackleton offered to leave a biscuit in the snow instead of eating it himself, saying it was worth more than money.
As Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare today. He stands out as a genuine example of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,C1,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye. Its way of finding food is similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker dig into wood to find insect larvae. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.
Although scientists first described the aye-aye's unusual feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.
Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the logs with food, chewing through the wood without needing to see the holes. This suggested they might be using their sense of smell or hearing to find the mealworms. However, further tests showed they did not rely on these senses either. They could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent.
So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they could sense the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and moves its large ears forward to listen closely. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye is using a method called echo-location, where it listens for sounds that bounce back from the hollow spaces in the wood. It can also hear the movement of insects when they are disturbed by the tapping.
The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously, just like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,C1,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? The few diaries we find give us only small pieces of information, and family stories are often only partly remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but these are still just images.
Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. Her work focuses on ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of their past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who really wanted to share their interesting lives. They often say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they enjoy the process too.""
The promise of privacy helps her clients feel comfortable sharing their stories. One 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure in business, said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful memories, like my divorce."" He wanted to share his story with his family so they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let his adult children read it yet. He feels there are details that might hurt them, and he prefers they read it after he is gone.
Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their childhood experiences. ""It’s amazing how much people are shaped by their parents,"" she says. ""The messages they received as children can affect them for their whole lives. They often repeat the same patterns in their relationships, either marrying people their parents liked or choosing partners as a way to rebel.""
Many people express regrets about their past. Even after many years, they still feel unresolved issues with their parents. If someone had problems in their youth, they often carry those into adulthood. Some people live their lives trying to impress a parent who never showed approval, and when that doesn’t work, they may feel the need to say, ""I can’t stand my mother.""
Hannah listens more than she asks questions. ""I’m not here to judge or pry,"" she explains. Sometimes, people share something and then worry if it should be included. She usually includes it, allowing them to remove anything they don’t want in the final draft. Most people want to be honest about their lives.
This is not about showing off or saying, ""Look at my interesting life."" Life is moving quickly, and we often forget our history. Writing these stories helps people connect with their roots. Many people want to leave a legacy for their descendants.
Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to write the life story. She organizes the material and writes it well. The final product looks professional and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. She receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the high cost stops many people from using her service. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I’ve worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted in the past."""
CAE_24,C1,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures in the world, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to know that none of the sculptures are real. All the sculptures are accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are many: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

Cambridge Darkroom is a photography center with community darkrooms and a gallery that shows a variety of photography and related media. We regularly offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows all members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (ages 12 to 16) to improve their skills through our Young Members program, led by our resident photographer. We sell photography books and magazines and have a full range of photographic materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and parts of the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, created by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and took care of the Woodward collection. Throughout his life, he greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to see the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern uses.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs across Great Britain. These photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human activities from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with any questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These copies are made to order and typically take about a month.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, making it one of the most unique tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. The brass plates were an alternative way to remember the tomb statues and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have been lucky to spend 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding my baby, which is what being a father means to me. I feel very fortunate with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become more of a friend than just a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have sometimes slapped my children in anger, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am available if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me first. If I start asking them why they haven’t contacted me, it makes them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities quite annoying. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected to what was happening. Because I was busy building my business when they were young, I missed some important events like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with many of our friends and join us at parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting and glamorous.
**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for our children, but as I became more involved in politics, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my kids can come with me. If I didn’t do this, they would feel left out. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their children to work. Maybe we are all realizing how important it is to include our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about fatherhood than I might have otherwise. I worked hard to stay connected with my children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents from the Seventies, I think I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate recently said that we were too lenient. I believe I could have set more rules and structure. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach, and I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your children never really leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice house, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter Betty has helped me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. It is a humbling experience. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but just one smile from her makes all the irritation go away. A baby's smile is the best way to make you feel better."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science Defying Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other plane. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the inside was very different. It was a long white tunnel with few windows and lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.
For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride. 
For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring up and then diving down. The pilot would turn off the engines at 3,000 meters, allowing the plane to rise higher for a moment before gravity pulled it back down. During the few seconds of weightlessness, the students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.
The flight started smoothly, but the students quickly realized this was not a normal passenger flight when the pilot made the plane climb steeply for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and the students felt the blood rush from their heads as they were pushed against the cabin floor. Then, the engines stopped, and they experienced weightlessness almost immediately. 
For 20 seconds, they floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. They could move in any direction, but it was confusing because up and down no longer made sense. After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, and some students landed hard.
After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of ""space time"" for their experiments. The Dutch students studied the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to find out how cats always land on their feet. They released their device, which floated upside down, and one student managed to turn it right side up using a remote control. 
Another student almost landed on it during a rough return to gravity. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joints changes without gravity, which could help in building future space stations. A team from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They believe that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.
After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, the students felt a mix of excitement and instability. Most felt exhilarated rather than sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.
I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which I enjoyed because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is suitable for planting trees.
I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I think my family became enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.
In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember it as a happy time since I was often wet and cold. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for the next planting session. I would come out of the Land Rover, warm and dry, but then face the rain, with my jacket still damp from the day before, my boots soaked, and my hands struggling with slippery laces. “The brain starts to think about many strange ideas and reflections about life.”
In that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very useful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it’s heavy, and it only gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line. These poles help you plant in a straight line. Once you are lined up, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back.
I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the fewest movements needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You train your body to do a series of standard moves, making it much easier. You develop a regular process: taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 
Mentally, it was interesting. My brain started to think about many ideas and reflections about life. A lot of my thoughts about nature and our place in it began during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.
I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984, alone for three months. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. In many ways, it is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth. It is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,C1,"**BRINGING UP BADGERS**
""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they often die from hunger without being found. 
These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still trying to suckle. I could see the cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth first to mimic their mother’s licking. This helped them to go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, although a bit unsteadily. They were happy with each other’s company and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.
However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed weak, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet discovered that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it is important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can go into their lungs. In Willow’s case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, especially for such a small cub. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two cubs. 
Then, six days later, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return because the area was too disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon found out why his mother had left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle’s teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. 
By the time they were nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, my badgers started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would get excited and chase each other’s tails. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with bruises.
During these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food because their own areas were not providing enough. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive, so we were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs. To protect them, we covered the gate with sheet metal. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and we started a campaign to build a sett for them on the farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside.
As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and their bedding than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline helped fund part of it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a proper home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle down. Half an hour later, I returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep.
Now, my walks with them are less frequent, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,C1,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding declination was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.
Halley was one of only two people in England at that time who were paid to do scientific research. He set out for the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic, but his first trip was cut short due to problems with the crew. He later made a second voyage that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.
Dr. Clark, who enjoys sailing, wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting the journey, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""
During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous work, *Principia Mathematica*, which is the basis of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with more advanced tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.
Dr. Clark explains, ""We usually measure the strength of the magnetic field, but not its direction. To measure direction, we need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use global positioning satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the journey. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.
Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian to be appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. 
Does Dr. Clark have the skills to make his journey successful? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
Does he share Halley's passion? ""I am ready to dedicate eight months to this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,C1,"**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior puzzles scientists, including Charles Darwin, who wondered how such a showy feature could help birds survive in a competitive world. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, where the strongest and smartest survive and reproduce. However, he thought that the peacock's tail was a burden and suggested a different idea called ""sexual selection."" This means that females might choose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed with him. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be a reason beyond just beauty. Wallace thought that the tail might signal some hidden quality that helps the males survive.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to answer these questions. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live in a natural environment but are used to people, making them easier to study. Marion Petrie and her team are investigating two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most beautiful tails? And do these males have other advantages, or is it just about looks?
The researchers have observed that the hens seem to prefer males with the most eye spots on their tails, which are also longer. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free from parasites, and their bright feathers could show this. However, Petrie and her team have not yet been able to check for parasites in the peacocks at Whipsnade.
This year, Petrie is studying the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the children of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that the females' choice is practical.
There is also an interesting theory from the mathematician and biologist R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will prefer long tails. This could lead to a situation where males with the longest tails have the most mates, and the preference for long tails continues to grow. Modern computer models show that this process could explain the evolution of the peacock's tail and support Darwin's idea that females might eventually choose beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He showed this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is filled with beautiful yachts that have the latest technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although she was designed last year, she looks like she is 100 years old, which might make you think her owner is a romantic. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.
My boat uses the best parts of traditional boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, it is important to note that advanced technology often keeps sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing. I am not saying that sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if everything is done for you? Dealing with a sail that flaps in the wind is part of being a sailor.
Why should we change the steering position from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot near the front? The sad truth is that this makes the inside of the boat feel like a big house, with a bed larger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said she had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over time, I learned how true that was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I ever sailed.
However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care because they are old. When I hurt my back badly, I realized I could no longer take care of her. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing good, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are skilled with computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before using a computer. After creating a model, just like boat builders did in the past, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.
The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the water, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This might be because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. This traditional method works well. In her calmness, she shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. So, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes, yoga, and other activities. The instructors are very well trained. I was surprised at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, really makes you feel refreshed. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I will definitely return. This is a perfect getaway for busy working women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, including an examination of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem found during the check-up was quickly shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You can enjoy a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not pretend to be one. It is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after enjoying the food. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens in the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a famous restaurant, has amazing dishes. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about all the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments. Cliveden has all these options if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a problem if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best sleep I’ve had in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would like to take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences. Genetically, we are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the things that make us different from animals are very recent. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other unique human traits come from just a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for a few genes.
Recent studies of animal behavior show that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for warnings like 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings suggest that there are not many absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art.
If human art comes from a unique genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. We only have clear evidence of human art from around 35,000 years ago, with famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
If we believe that our recent burst of creativity makes us different, we need to consider how our art is different from animal art. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is made for enjoyment, and it is learned rather than instinctive.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, like defending territory or attracting a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.
The second claim is that human art is motivated by enjoyment. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during the breeding season, suggesting they do not sing just for pleasure. Again, this makes human art seem unique.
The third claim is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris, but people can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs, even if they have never heard them before.
Human art styles change quickly. For example, Roman authors wrote about geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. However, human art evolves so fast that even casual museum visitors can tell that a painting from the 20th century is newer than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when and who painted a work, but they might confuse two mid-20th century artists named Congo and Betsy. In reality, these artists were chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment, and he got upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.
These paintings by our closest relatives blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not created for practical purposes; they were made for the satisfaction of the painter. You might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend to communicate with others, while the apes did not care about sharing their art. However, this argument is not very strong, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,C1,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. In the past, children's stories featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. Today, such characters are rare in stories and in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, which means ""once entered, you never come out."" Local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have cost everyone their lives and made the expedition very difficult.
This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back since no one had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will be surprised by the word ""kind."" The team faced terrible challenges: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn't experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn't mean we didn't struggle the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""
""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do this now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""
Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet, when I think of my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. By that measure, the desert does not compare.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We were motivated by a sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,C1,"Life Without Gadgets**
Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful devices that make life easier and save us time. However, this belief can be misleading. For example, using our fingers does not use up energy like our machines do, and doing things by hand does not harm the environment. 
After a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost a lot to fix, Susan began to think that gadgets are often not worth the money or the hassle. She started to let her household gadgets break down naturally. This made her question what ""time"" technology really gives us. Does it just allow us to do more things that require even more gadgets? 
When her broken machine started making strange noises, she decided to leave it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys not being tied to a noisy machine and can take her time with her sewing. Although she appreciates some gadgets, like her washing machine, she found joy in living without others. 
For example, they returned their rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped them spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. Susan has taken up sewing by hand since her old sewing machine is now just a table for plants. 
People often think they cannot live without their gadgets, but Susan believes that life can be better without them. She enjoys sewing while listening to the radio or talking with family. If the task is simple, she can even watch her favorite TV shows while sewing, which makes her feel less guilty about watching TV. 
Sewing by hand is not as hard as she once thought. It is relaxing and satisfying to see her work improve. She finds that things get done quickly, and she can enjoy a slower pace of life. She also enjoys washing dishes by hand, which allows her to daydream. 
Now, Susan looks around her home and wonders if they really need all their gadgets, like the freezer or microwave. She realizes they could save a lot of money by living without some of these electric devices."
CAE_62,C1,"The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst**
Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes a living by creating beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, which is located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is hard to tell if he is really in a hurry or just acting tough. Looking around the workshop, I see that he is indeed busy, with many pieces of furniture and wooden planks in different natural colors.
Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a good reputation. His order book is always full for several months ahead, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right person to contact. 
Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, as the craft is still alive in the countryside. However, it is harder to find a cabinet-maker who focuses on making well-crafted furniture with clean, simple designs. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people call themselves furniture-makers."" He has high standards and is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He criticizes mass-produced items and craftsmen who make poor-quality pieces. This desire for perfection is a big part of Hurst's success, along with his talent. He is confident in his skills and says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things.""
Hurst learned his craft on his own. He explains, ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up."" Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return to him for more projects. He enjoys doing complete jobs for their homes, but he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want until it is too late. He prefers clients who are clear about their needs.
Although Hurst is proud of his work, he also recognizes the talent of others. He says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He is critical of craftsmen who take too long to make one piece and of students who focus on making fashion statements with their work. He believes that furniture should be practical and useful, not just a statement.
Hurst may be confident and direct, but he is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"**Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need sleep. There are three main theories.
The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and help us feel better.
The second theory focuses on learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.
The third theory is about energy. It says that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted rules of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and strange habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the editor about various topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality. 
Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism is the desire to be unique, while conformity is the desire to fit in. For many people, the need to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out. 
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests or concerns. The key word here is 'common.' They seek others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group can be comforting.
Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be different. Even when we follow the crowd, we may feel the need to show our individuality. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" or a new acquaintance might declare, ""You must take me as I am."" 
Anyone can choose to embrace their individuality at any time. Many successful people have done this. For instance, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it without giving up, you will surprise many people."" However, this self-assertion is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 
When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is that it is natural. 
Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. A true eccentric does not care much about what others think. They act according to their true selves. This makes eccentrics different from enthusiasts, pranksters, clever criminals, show-offs, and recluses. These people are aware of society and often react to it. Some want to impress others, while others want to escape from society. But eccentrics live their lives freely, without concern for what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet many important people in this field. One of the most significant is Barbara Ward, a small and delicate woman who has greatly influenced environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these complex topics. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" However, I believe her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" Although its title sounds old-fashioned, it focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a powerful call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book beautifully explains the interesting world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see that their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's simple yet effective paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to an exciting career in conservation. It defined my love for the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, reading this book made me feel hopeful again. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some people think humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living beings as a family, connected and inseparable. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered so much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five important British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people say they buy a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more relaxed about bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own feelings about a book since they are often the first to read it.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a problem with not enough attention given to paperbacks, which many people read. Weekly reviews often do not cover enough books, and even original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several positive reviews.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books. Most of our books are not by famous authors, so we rely on literary editors to give us space in their publications. Good reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can help launch a book and even a writer's career, but they need to work together with other factors like recommendations from readers and effective marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the United States, it is straightforward: a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for people to notice a good writer. Interestingly, some poorly reviewed books become bestsellers. The situation is unpredictable, but non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than on the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would pay attention. Today, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that dates back to ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special item just for them,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something special that reflects the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's work is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked the surprise gift he made for his wife and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he explains. 
Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change their roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""
Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available because they are still very popular. ""People like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They want something a little different.""
Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something almost lifelike,"" he explains. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds that more people are moving to the countryside and want to add special touches to their homes, which helps crafts like his.
Graham is now busier than ever, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world. He has noticed a lot of interest from buyers in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,C1,"**Beginner Takes All**
Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.
At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a tough time. A film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He felt disappointed and worried because he hadn’t earned any money in two years, and the film was his only hope to calm his angry bank manager. A sensible person in his situation would have found a job, maybe returning to television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel.
Although this decision seemed impulsive, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. He had met a farrier on Dartmoor who told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive. The horse's owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These special people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans, who initially wanted to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after his disappointment with the film industry, he decided to write it as a book.
During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He later reflected, ""It was a strange time. I was observing people, but I felt very alone and like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and worried about how to support my children.""
By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from the bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked about the potential advance, he suggested Evans might get $30,000. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had at least two months of work left. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with the summary, to seven UK publishers just before they went to the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""You what?"" The agent replied, ""It's OK, I just feel something big is happening.""
What happened next is now famous in publishing. Within a week of intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans said, ""We couldn't believe it; we just sat there in shock. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don’t know how it got there."" They also didn’t send it to Hollywood, but soon major film studios were competing to buy the rights. Evans's UK agent wisely involved an American agent, who called to say, ""I think we can get $3 million."" They all laughed in disbelief.
As they agreed on this amount, the studios wanted to present their ideas to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called one after another, hoping to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me while we enjoyed coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It’s been like a fairy tale so far. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very hard, and I don’t want to become just an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much money. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll bring in someone else.'""
He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become more of a young person's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. He won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, he is 49 years old, out of practice, and not in great shape. Spassky is even older.
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time, or they lose the game. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This increased pressure favors younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30.
The way chess is played has also changed. Much of it now happens off the board. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially because computers have changed the game. A small computer can store one million chess games and provide quick access to many games of an opponent. In recent matches, players have used large teams to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can be the key to winning.
Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense situations, players must act quickly and decisively, similar to athletes.
At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess masters must be ready to compete again the next day. Most tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in 1984 had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10 kg during that time.
Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game seem strange. However, it also made him a legend. If he has returned for the money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,C1,"**Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.
**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" Nick is very talented, but what is surprising is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it can cause. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""
**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was copying him,"" Simon admits.
**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always meant to succeed. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid doing homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes serious. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but I just want two people to buy it and be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt really down, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won many awards and honors, more than most people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and realized I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more words that could be bad. My main goal is to avoid just producing work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn’t want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance stories and is looking for the right man. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired,"" similar to the dramatic pace of early silent films.
B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart but shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon features a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the gentler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with old stores, classic cars, and radio shows.
C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife’s first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife’s ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author untangles these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a fun and clever read.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters and become deeply involved in their lives.
E. This touching and funny story, written by a great American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make up for it, he becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor while dealing with everyday life. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four academic writers discuss international volunteer work. 
A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work has a big impact on development. While volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a lot of money to participate in these projects. This money could be better used if donated directly to local communities, as it could pay for more labor than one volunteer can provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have the necessary skills or experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are truly motivated by a desire to help others or if they are more interested in improving their own careers. However, these projects can help develop people who may act ethically in their future careers.
B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and greater participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help create international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the overall benefits can be greater than the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and local communities. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may only benefit them and not the communities that need help. Those who volunteer may continue to gain advantages while using local organizations and communities for their own growth.
C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that is more about helping wealthy Westerners than the communities they visit. It can also provide important technical assistance for development. When done well, international volunteering can benefit both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the sharing of skills and experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and commitment to fighting against poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.
D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the growing trend of wanting to help others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially in a time when people are skeptical of big governments and businesses. However, this focus on individual charity can ignore the need for democratic solutions and can reduce development to simple acts of kindness, which may not change the difficult situations faced by poor communities. While volunteering is a good act, when it is promoted as a solution for sustainable development, it can weaken the true understanding of development issues. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from the real problems of global inequality and poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and we often need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group that included me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges tested five different models available now.
One model has a 'dual alarm function' that lets you set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. However, it does not let you snooze and then wake up later as I first thought. This model costs about the same as another one we tested, but it has a cassette player, which is a nice feature. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to a quiet morning. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was a problem; it was as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.
This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can easily tap it while still half-asleep. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which caused some confusion when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out, which we all liked. But we found it difficult to set up, even though figuring it out made us feel cool and sophisticated.
Tom Granger thought another model, which has a built-in lamp, was 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was hard to position, and you couldn’t read by it since it only lit up the clock, which was already bright. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, which made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people, with its bright colors and fun design, which appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said, 'I would choose this one because it stands out more than the others.' 
The traditional controls made this model the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual says, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time.' Paul Bridges laughed at this idea and said the model was 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'
The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space,' and it had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, 'It's easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed all the buttons correctly, so you can’t be confident it will work.' He agreed that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"**Hedgehogs**
A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All types of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked, which makes their spines point outwards. This is a good way to protect themselves, but it depends on how many spines they have. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines. Because of this, they are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using their rolling ability only as a last option.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs will stay awake all year."
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
Excelling in any sport is difficult, even for men, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competing take up a lot of time, leaving little room for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's a wonderful feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well, or the weather is bad, but I just keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside of skiing because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally - it’s a young sport.""
**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing since I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not because I am a great cyclist. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because very few schools offer it. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Also, coaches often change, so the women’s team lacks stability. But I enjoy it and love being fit, plus there is a good social life.""
**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how big it is! I felt trapped in Britain and wanted freedom. Each walk has been different. Walking across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with very little sleep and had many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""
**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, men think they must beat me, so I have had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are joining racing every year. I love saloon car racing because I always aim for perfection.""
**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before a race, and I really push myself during the race. I often wonder why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the articles focus on the men’s events, and only 10% mention the women’s. The prize money is also not as good. But we have created an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to improve this."""
CAE_34,C1,"**The Day I Met Picasso**
Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could recognize Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.
Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have approached him if my friend hadn’t encouraged me. Nervously, I introduced myself and asked for his signature, and to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of my sketchbook and then added some lively lines below. These lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.
I thanked him and started a conversation, but since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was not great either, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. Still, I told Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend what I had. He noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and encouraged me to go back and talk to him again. 
So, with my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided not to ask if I could draw his portrait, as I was afraid he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, set up my pad, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled and made it hard for me to concentrate. He acted out funny faces and gestures, making it a challenge to draw him. Even though it was difficult, I felt he was testing my determination.
Eventually, Picasso relaxed and let me study him without distractions. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were full of life. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed to be in his own world, quietly focused on his thoughts.
When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with just one lively line. 
I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks. I thanked Picasso and asked if he could sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he was not going to give me another one! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,C1,"**Talking Shop**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? This article explains the tricks that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.
**A. The Image of Freshness**  
Supermarkets know that customers like fresh food. They often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store feel fresh. Some stores even have bakeries that fill the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are also chosen to make customers think of fresh produce. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.
**B. Displaying to Advantage**  
The way products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas of the store customers visit the most. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are more likely to be bought, so manufacturers want their items placed there. Special bins with discounts attract bargain hunters. Stores also place related items together, like desserts near ice cream.
**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, customers pass by more expensive items on their way. Stores may also put popular products far from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and see other tempting products along the way.
**D. Less Sells More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from the idea of selling many items cheaply. Instead, they create a boutique feel by showing fewer items, making them seem exclusive. Their success comes from good store design as well as stylish clothing.
**E. Tempting Totals**  
Food shoppers often pay more attention to the total cost of their shopping than to the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with more expensive items. They sometimes sell staples at a loss to attract customers, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They also get low prices by buying in large amounts or by promoting products prominently.
**F. The All-Important Price Tag**  
Customers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and notice prices more. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft by making staff ring up sales for small change.
**G. Lighting to Effect**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores pay attention to lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh foods look more appealing.
**H. Walk This Way**  
Many chain stores use different types of carpet to guide customers through the store. The main paths are often marked with one pattern, while sales areas have another. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use nicer carpets in sales areas to encourage customers to explore.
**I. In-Store Promotion**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see large pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and can increase sales significantly."
CAE_26,C1,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington, 58, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*, he called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing techniques, and Robin could show Chris how to sail. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to shore to practice climbing.
The climbing route was challenging, but Chris was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. When they reached a steep drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. After Chris finished, Robin politely asked if he could climb down using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while Chris wanted him to use his legs. Chris was not very happy about it, but Robin managed to lower himself down safely.
During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin formed a strong friendship. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a big step from their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked for everyone's opinion first. Most of the time, people were too afraid to give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making.
To be honest, Chris found sailing difficult and boring. He preferred the excitement of dealing with problems, but he struggled with spending many days at sea. He was not a natural sailor like Robin, who enjoyed fixing the engine and other tasks. Chris sometimes felt useless and found it hard to be so close to the other crew members on a small yacht designed for four people, but they had six on board.
When they reached Greenland and it was Chris's turn to lead the expedition, he felt nervous about being responsible for Robin's safety. There were times when Robin could have fallen and taken Chris with him, so Chris had to be very careful. He underestimated how hard it would be to climb the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain. Robin was not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin trusted Chris completely and just followed him. When it became too difficult, Chris knew they had to turn back, and Robin accepted this decision. 
Chris also knew that Robin was worried about their boat and whether it would be safe in the ice. Still, Robin wanted to try climbing the mountain again. The only time they had a serious disagreement was on the yacht on the way home. They were taking turns to keep watch. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his shift, but Robin decided not to wake him, thinking he could handle it alone. Chris had almost fallen asleep the night before and felt that Robin did not trust him. He expressed his feelings, and Robin quickly reassured him that he had misunderstood the situation.
While they enjoyed their trip to Skye, they did not truly get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. Chris discovered that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been part of human life for a very long time, with many different types in various colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this important part of our history.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored dried apple halves for the winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we eat today.
**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and this knowledge was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but many did not grow well in Britain. After the Norman Conquest, new apple types became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.
**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became common in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known for its pear-like shape, was a popular dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century. However, due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, apple production decreased, and more apples were imported. In the sixteenth century, King Henry VIII sent his fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many new apple types, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them. Captain Bligh from the Bounty brought apples to Australia, and Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa. The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower also carried apples to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple nurseries across several states. He was seen as a kind man and became a part of many stories.
**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa found a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. When he showed it at a fruit event, a judge tasted it and called it 'Delicious'. In 1895, this apple was sold as 'Delicious' and became very popular worldwide.
**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was the daughter of convicts but chose to live a different life. As a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales, she took care of her family’s farm. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She moved it, and soon she was harvesting green apples that became famous worldwide. She said, ""It’s just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her background.
**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, from India to Africa. However, most apples come from only a few varieties, chosen for their appearance or how well they travel, not for their taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as it reduces the different types of apples available. While some gardeners in the UK have kept old apple types alive, many varieties in the US have been lost. However, consumers are starting to want more variety. We cannot rely only on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity; we must work to protect and value the natural variety of apples and other foods for everyone’s benefit."

**Raft and River Journeys**
Our river trips can last from a few hours to several days, ranging from easy paddling to thrilling whitewater rafting. No experience is needed, and safety skills are taught quickly. These journeys provide a unique view of the landscapes and wildlife along the rivers."
CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner from Britain, visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is located ten miles south of the equator, on a beautiful mountain track that leads to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. For the past three years, Nerurkar has trained in this area during the winter, but he had never trained with Kenyan runners before. On his fourth trip, he decided to change that. He participated in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race.
Training at high altitude helps runners produce more red blood cells, which improves their ability to carry oxygen. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. Nerurkar's first race in Africa was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, but he felt he had done well.
Nerurkar believes that Kenyan success is not only due to the high altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple and relaxed approach to running, and they genuinely enjoy competing. However, the most important question is how they train. During his time at the training camp, he learned about their training routine. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The living conditions are basic, with athletes sharing rooms in dormitories.
Each day, the athletes follow a strict training schedule that includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Their day starts at six in the morning, and they cover about 40 kilometers daily, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. 
Life at the camp is simple. They prepare for breakfast with just a splash of water and a quick brush of their teeth. Breakfast includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After training, they often go to bathe in streams that flow from Mount Kenya's glaciers.
By the end of his stay, Nerurkar gained a deeper understanding of why Kenyan runners are so successful. Their achievements cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. He believes that the simplicity of their mountain lifestyle, their hard training, and their passion for running are key reasons for Kenya's success in distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**
Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem started in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The decline in advertising is happening all over the world. The main issue is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For big items like cars, you might only buy one every three years, and many people get their cars from their jobs. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even if you include all the other products and services you buy, it is likely that you do not purchase more than 400 different brands in a year.
Now, compare that to the 32,500 brands that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend very little on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are analyzed by Media Register. The average person buys only 400 of these brands, which is about 4 percent. This means that a large amount of advertising is wasted. When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. Most people find that only about 6 percent of the ads are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent of the ads are likely wasted.
You might think you are different and that you do not respond to advertising, but most people feel the same way. The truth is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always some waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. Many ads have shown that they work. Advertisers need to reach a large number of people to find the few who will respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested.
Even with careful targeting, advertisers cannot avoid all waste. For example, even the best direct mail campaigns do not get a 100 percent response rate. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every person they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all; they could contact those people directly.
Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is considered successful. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be very happy with a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can attract 2 percent of the population is very successful, even though that is a small part of the total population. While mass media can be a cost-effective way to reach people, advertising needs to be more focused than ever to succeed again."
CAE_43,C1,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Greenest Home**
Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting features. First, it is home to Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral famous for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen. Second, it has the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is known as the greenest home in Britain.
The Vales have created a house that uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost for the garden, and heats the house using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located about 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's older buildings and received approval from planners, even though it is in a conservation area.
When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Once inside, you must take off your shoes, as Robert insists on this. The atmosphere is calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow, as the house is designed to be draught-proof. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to also avoid using mains water. They designed special toilets that compost waste, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.
Robert explains that they want to show people it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness. The only medieval feature of the house is its design, with a hall that includes the fireplace and staircase, reaching the full height of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.
Soon, they will install solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden, which will help the house generate more electricity. While they will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances, they expect to produce extra electricity, enough to eventually charge an electric car. The only heating source is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they only use during the coldest winter days.
When Charles visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but Robert said it felt comfortable because there were no draughts and everything was at the same temperature. He noted that people in the past were comfortable at lower temperatures due to their clothing. He suggested that those living in older homes should consider going back to how people lived before 1900, although this idea may not be popular.
The secret to the house's success is its simple design, which means there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were sourced from local builders and installed by local craftsmen, making it affordable to build—costing the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are not keen on this idea."
CAE_51,C1,"**The Camera Never Lies**
Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational and scientific man. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof of these tiny creatures. He published the photos with an article where he accepted fairies as magical beings. 
It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the simple trick showed that a basic idea about photography is wrong: that the camera cannot lie. 
In fact, the camera can lie, and it always has. Today, we often use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
Throughout history, iron has captured the human imagination, and blacksmiths, the people who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were made by talented blacksmiths.
However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron features. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with manufacturers of gates and balconies often calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks with extra decorations.
Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and several events in the coming weeks aim to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are now more aware of the craft. 
Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it more easily. Dawson explains, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces are on display, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork.
Dawson has created an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow into shape when it’s hot, saying, ""It's like drawing with metal in space."" Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it’s very soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable.""
Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by dark castles often seen in horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another resembles a Celtic cross. She loves how steel feels cold and hard, and how it seems to last forever. No other metal can provide as much visual pleasure or a sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used for decorative purposes for many years to come, as long as we don’t have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying for me too. 
The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn’t plan to stop smoking, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, and I still do. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.
On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session in Birmingham called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop myself; it wouldn’t be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, and I thought it was reasonable to expect that their method wouldn’t work on me. I really enjoyed smoking; it made me happy.
The counselor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge, the idea of quitting began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that was just for me. Could I also achieve other things?
In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it wasn’t a problem at all. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing things at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 
I am starting to think that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—like eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,C1,"**Dorothy Who?**
Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. Georgina Ferry has been testing her friends to see if they recognize Hodgkin. When she tells them she is writing a biography about her, she watches for their reactions. If they seem surprised and say things like, ""Isn't there already a biography?"" they pass the test.
Hodgkin deserves to be known because she achieved something very special. She won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964 for her work on important substances like penicillin and vitamin B12. She was a remarkable person, and her life shows the changes in the 20th century, such as the growth of women's education and the global nature of science.
When Georgina started her research, she wanted to read biographies of scientists. A friend suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of Hodgkin and also won Nobel Prizes. However, when she went to the bookstore, she found that there were no biographies of Pauling available. This surprised her, even though Pauling was a very important chemist.
Many people, including scientists, think that biographies of scientists are often boring. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, once said that the lives of scientists are usually dull. This belief makes it hard for publishers to sell books about scientists. Most biographies in bookstores are about famous artists, writers, or politicians, not scientists.
It is not true that scientists have less interesting lives than people in the arts. Some scientists are careful about how they present themselves in public. For example, a well-known geneticist said he would not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This attitude can make science seem less inviting to young people.
Fortunately, things are changing. More scientists are appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives out awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help people see scientists as real individuals, not just researchers.
The world of publishing is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and often ignored the personal lives of scientists. However, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" have shown that scientists can have interesting and funny stories. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are shown with their flaws, making them more relatable.
Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her work and also had a family. She had three children and a husband who was often away for work. While her personal life may not seem directly related to her scientific achievements, it shows how she balanced different parts of her life. 
Hodgkin's passion for science was a big part of who she was. Communicating this passion is a challenge for biographers because many readers may not understand complex scientific ideas. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.
It is unfortunate that many educated people do not recognize the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,C1,"**Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Farmers whose wells have dried up often ask for her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.
This ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground is called dowsing. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One of the most believable ideas is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers believe they can sense these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.
Recently, during dry years, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers include people with remote cottages or barns that are now holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. There are also golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She says, ""You can't drill a well if there is a risk of waste getting into the water supply. The water we find is in cracks of solid rock, and if we bring it up correctly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, there are many minerals, so we have to be careful about iron.""
Electricity is also needed to run the pump, but it can be too costly to bring power across long fields. So, it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. After considering these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. It will swing when she is above an area with water.
Once she has identified possible locations on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick. The stick is forked and equal in length and width on both sides. She says, ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is very important to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""
Margaret's husband also checks the same area. Usually, they agree on where to drill, but if they disagree, they will keep looking until they find a spot they both agree on.
Margaret is not alone in her abilities; many researchers and writers have been interested in this mysterious skill. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard for her family to continue their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,C1,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**
Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? It might be fun to try something completely different! We arranged this for four people. Here’s how it went.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda is 23 and a mother of two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant. 
Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. It was very different from her hometown, and she felt nervous. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when Amanda tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and told her it happens to everyone.
By 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers outside, and Amanda felt even more nervous. She worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was done with a computer system. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to her, she had to say, ""Pardon?"" which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and just wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, and Amanda realized how tiring waitressing could be. She thought it was an easy job, but it actually requires a lot of energy and a friendly attitude. Amanda is quite shy, and she knew she couldn’t handle the busy Saturday nights. She was also disappointed with the tips she received. In the end, she was happy to return to her children, as being a mother felt much easier after her day as a waitress!
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy, who is 30, was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She had heard that Amanda's daughters could be cheeky, but she thought she could manage. 
When Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have three hours of peace. But she was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded her that she still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry. 
At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. But when she brought Sophie home from school, things got chaotic. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and screamed loudly while playing. Cindy thought they would tire out soon, but she was mistaken. She tried to get them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun began! The girls kept asking for glasses of water, which was just a trick to get them downstairs to watch TV. Cindy realized how tiring it is to take care of two small children. There was no time for herself, and the responsibility felt overwhelming. Still, she enjoyed the day.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary is 42 and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a primary school teacher. 
On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt great! She was unsure how to dress for school and hoped she wouldn’t stand out. At assembly, she faced about 400 students and hoped to blend in. 
In class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from Rosemary's school days. She helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There was a lot to do before classes started again. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which she enjoyed, and then a French lesson where the children practiced on her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, Rosemary was exhausted, while the children still had energy. Speaking in front of the class was the hardest part for her. Although teachers have more holidays, Rosemary decided she prefers farming.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! Rosemary's farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell.
Hilary spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice cream. It was hard not to taste everything! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are not helped quickly, they can die, so they need daily checks. 
After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! Hilary found the day lonely and missed being around children because animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of farming is that there is no time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, making it hard to plan vacations. Rosemary only gets about three days off this year. Farming may seem romantic, but the reality is very different. The income can be unstable, and Hilary wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,C1,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is surprising how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by forgotten composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces.
When you meet him, he looks younger than his age and has a bright and friendly personality, just like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a television program featured his work and development, filmed in both London and Sweden.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo, and his music career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to buy him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played the trumpet all the time. His mother found the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra and convinced him to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, quickly recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher from the beginning, someone who loved the trumpet and sought out players worldwide.
Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and build a relationship with them. From the start, Hardenberger had a talent for finding the right balance and making that connection. He says that even as a child, his unique sound was already recognizable.
Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also avoided orchestras. Hardenberger collected all of Andre's records, and his parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.
At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson wanted him to go to America, it was considered too far and dangerous. Instead, at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud agreed with Hardenberger's view that playing in an orchestra was not for him, comparing it to digging in the garden. Hardenberger knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience.
Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but made it to the second. Fortunately, he already knew most of the pieces for that round too. However, in the final, he faced a concerto that intimidated him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even though he felt he played poorly, people were still listening.
Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what makes his communication special, saying, ""You risk destroying it by trying to explain. The power of music is that it can always move people."""

B. Harriet is a confident middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to talk about what happened. Leo, who was a good student and had never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe physically recovers but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, and from this meeting, an unusual friendship develops. The author is skilled at showing how people react to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.
C. This book, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long and quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, imagined through the daydreams of a young boy named Throfinn Ragnarson. He suddenly disappears in the story but returns after the Second World War, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.
D. After his recent success, the author has written a sequel that carries the same gentle humor and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is approaching her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's way of living is still a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, and Rosie helps her in her entertaining manipulation of friends and suitors. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary moments of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright spots of human experience.
E. Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences as they prepare to return home, their spirits lifted by life at sea. The author uses striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which can be both isolating and enlightening."
CAE_20,C1,"**Take Five Careers**
Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical day looks like for them.
**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  
**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and arrive at work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. There are times when I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed during surgery, but I sometimes worry about the next day. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it is successful, it feels amazing, even if it doesn’t always work. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see outpatients and explain the surgeries. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to patients. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""
**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  
**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with only a small part for design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they agree, we create budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to ensure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people, and good communication is very important. When their work arrives, I put everything together and send it to the printers. Managing several projects at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always close, and my day is never the same. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to the pub. If a client likes my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be later. I find it hard to relax, especially when I’m busy.""
**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  
**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on some days, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which helps me plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude, but most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""
**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  
**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each place. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local café for breakfast. In summer, I might work until 10 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I have an office at home, so when I return, I check messages and calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually set up a meeting in the evening. We focus on using old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes clients have strange ideas, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. It’s hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows me to be creative.""
**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  
**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. I am the assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site workers and solve problems. The contractors start at 6 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we check the contractors' work, it can create tension, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by going through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these are very important to the artists, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, choosing songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also share my vision for the album with the marketing team. I manage budgets and spending. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm, and most evenings I go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.
**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule to see if we have any clients visiting that day. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and helping them buy furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000, and we buy from auctions and private clients. Many items need restoration, so I work with restorers and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business. I also visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I usually go home at 5:30 pm, and it takes me about an hour to relax after work.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. I work for about an hour and a half at one station, then take a break and switch to another station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I often read about new air traffic rules between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. This job can be stressful, so I take sick days if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by getting the electronic sales system ready. I make sure someone is watching the cash register and coordinate lunch breaks for the staff. In the morning, I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to quickly gather many books for them. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new book titles with them. I need to decide how many copies of a new title we might sell. I ensure that new titles are delivered on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, and then I close the store and go home.
**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for multinational companies, warning clients about potential problems in other countries. I provide three services: an online news preview, a security forecast for the next six months, and a travel security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will cover. My first news preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly. I write the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax in the evenings; I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps create change. Leadership is not about being tall or smart. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is very important. A good leader should be able to express their ideas clearly and confidently. Dixon says it’s about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
**B. Discovering Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more potential for leadership than they think. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for good management.
**C. Comparing Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first boss led well, while the second just managed poorly.
**D. Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes that a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a struggling organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.
**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different leadership styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead instead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to achieve them. Look at your job and identify areas where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career.
**F. Developing Leadership Skills**  
- Leadership does not just happen; it develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don’t assume everyone will immediately accept your leadership style. It might even push some people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your leadership is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller called ""Abyss."" It tells the story of oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud and his team, remind us of tough heroes from older films by Howard Hawks. The film has great production design and special effects, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of James Jones's novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different take compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is poetic and mystical, Marton's film is more traditional but stays closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has some strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.
**C. On Guard**  
This film is loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel and is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain, while Vincent Perez is an energetic hero, even if his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, who plays an acrobat-turned-swordsman, might be too serious for this light-hearted film, but he has his good moments. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama elements with so much humor and charm that it works well.
**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film tells a serious story. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the historical details and not enough on the dark themes of the story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skills. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement back. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic features ""forty-eight international stars,"" according to its promotion. With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened soldiers wait for news about the invasion, are slow and drag on for both the audience and the characters. While it is impressive in terms of logistics, it is best experienced on the big screen. Watching it on video does not do it justice."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed very interesting. The story is about a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the outcome is uncertain until the very end, with a surprising twist in the last pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a strong beginning and follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the rich during the Italian Renaissance. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church secrets, and serious crimes, but we always believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated, and the book is a bit too long, but it is still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who seems ready to investigate when a strange man suddenly dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, brave and adaptable Leah proves to be a strong character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, who helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thoughtful discussion than usual. Parker always provides high-quality entertainment.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, as they investigate an attack and robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and attention to unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book combines romance, money, and violence to create an exciting suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw shows actor Philip Fletcher in a new role as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not how he wants his career to go. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the shift from dark comedy to farce is not his best work.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this book stand out from typical detective novels."
CAE_57,C1,"I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. I have traveled before; after university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I came back, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, I realized I was sacrificing my happiness for my job. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 
I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of my freedom, if only for my friends! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and I’m already behind schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” 
Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m putting it off because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is possible: “People who always say ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are now understanding they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.”
For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I come back, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!” 
For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change my approach to live well as a civilian.” There are many reasons for people my age to travel, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today, we have a more flexible workforce. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Some companies even have career-break policies, knowing that if they invest in training someone, that person will return instead of going to a competitor.
Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job—and many people aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t forever. Travel allows you to step back and think about your life.” 
Is wanting to travel just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he’s not running away. “I’m running towards something. I want to grab the things I want for myself.” But he also feels nervous. “I’ll miss my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ‘hi’ to everyone, and having coffee.” 
I share Ben’s worries about leaving behind a stable life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult. Jennifer Cox points out that this is common. “There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel.” It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll be proud to have taken this step. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,C1,"**Plugging in the Home**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. In this passage, she shares how she changed her home into a productive workplace.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was lost due to technology. A quick look at my resume showed that I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. I felt that no one would trust me with a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was known as the family technophobe; even calculators confused me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.
I knew I had to act quickly to fill the gap in my career. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.
The children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous, thinking I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I was not very skilled, I learned the basics. It was logical and easy to understand. With practice, I improved a little each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.
So, how has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always messy, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track my income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.
However, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the kids are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment, but also for convenience, avoiding the daily commute to the city.
As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless."
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum look very different from the historic city of Edinburgh where it is located. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.
You cannot miss the new Museum of Scotland. It stands out on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings that look like cheese wedges, topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more cautious or even negative. Now, as the inside is almost ready for visitors, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.
The museum tells the story of Scotland through many interesting displays. It has a timeline to help visitors understand the history, but it does not force them to follow a strict order. The museum also showcases important national treasures, like the jewels of Mary Queen of Scots and silver from Holyrood chapel, without overwhelming visitors with national pride.
The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that visiting should be a fun and visual experience. The museum is designed for everyone, even those who know little about Scotland's history. However, Dr. Clarke is strict about what is displayed. He does not want to show imaginary scenes from the past, as he believes it is important to present the truth.
Visitors will see what experts know about the objects on display. The challenge is whether the stories of these objects can be told clearly using explanation panels, captions, and multimedia displays, with only about 30 computers available in the museum. With less than three days before the opening, it is hard to tell for sure.
Some things are clear, though. The views of Edinburgh Castle are breathtaking. Inside, the layout of the museum is striking. Galleries connect to each other in different sizes and shapes, with pale walls that look like large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light comes through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space where visitors can enjoy each item on display.
Thanks to a group of 12 young people from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. They wanted to create a fun way to explore the displays. Although they did not get to ride through the exhibits, they succeeded in creating a hands-on center for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition area. The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change every three years and features objects chosen by Scottish people that have had a big impact on life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is entertaining, it may not address more serious topics.
Overall, Dr. Clarke is right when he says that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in its location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,C1,"**The Future of Print Newspapers**
The end of print newspapers may take a while. The word ""transition"" is nice and calming. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving from the present to the future in a smooth way. However, the change for newspapers to go online is uncertain and uncomfortable. It might not even be a real process.
Many believe that this change will happen eventually. It is well-known that print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.
This might be true, but there are some things that don’t fit this picture. If print sales have not fallen much, maybe the crisis mainly affects newspapers. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries fell, Asia's sales increased significantly. News and current affairs magazines, which are expected to struggle in the digital age, also saw a 5.4% increase.
In short, while some magazine areas are declining, many are growing quickly. A similar trend is seen in books. Sales of e-readers like Kindle are rising sharply this year. However, when booksellers looked at the sales of physical books over the last six months, they found only a small decrease of 0.4%. This shows that people are buying both e-books and physical books.
The idea that young people are completely giving up reading newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries in Europe have different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.
These different trends suggest that the situation is more complicated than what many believe about the digital revolution. In the past, American media analysts thought that online advertising would help newspapers succeed online. However, digital advertising on newspaper websites is now decreasing, making those earlier beliefs seem outdated. 
Currently, 360 US newspapers, including many well-known ones, have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital access together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. Print advertising also earns much more money than online ads.
However, maintaining both a website and a print edition is challenging and expensive for newspaper companies. Despite this, print newspapers still have a strong presence, while being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The camera can also change how people behave.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of the camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. Avoid having the subject look away from the camera, as this can make the picture less interesting.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the photo. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it gives the viewer a sense of observing a moment. Candid shots can be very captivating, and the subject's expression is important.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they are a quick way to communicate feelings.
**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more context. When including a background, avoid distracting details. Make sure the subject stands out against the background, which can be done by using a wide-angle lens.
**H. Interaction**  
Photos of people interacting, like talking or laughing together, often make great pictures. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams can create appealing shots. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a friendly gesture.
**I. People and Places**  
Many pictures of people are taken during trips. To improve these photos, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or landscape. Position the people close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. A slightly higher camera angle can help achieve this balance.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met on holiday, a clear posed picture is good. However, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, creating better memories for the future."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.
Not many artists choose not to sign their work unless someone asks them to, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting magazine interview. She admits, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she even gets nervous when asked to be photographed.
After a little time, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and entertaining conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she spent two years drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not satisfied with illustration and decided to work with a well-known decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that sparked her interest. She left to start her own career, not knowing exactly where it would lead, but feeling hopeful.
Sarah's ability to observe details, which she developed through her illustration work, is very important for her art. She often gets asked where people can learn trompe-l'oeil, but she believes it cannot be taught. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she explains. She is always learning and believes that if you think you have mastered something, you should give up.
Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math, especially when she had to measure for a large project on a chapel ceiling. She thought to herself, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" This self-doubt makes her view her talent in a unique way. Sometimes she talks about her work in the third person, saying, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""
Her trompe-l'oeil art is exceptional and stands out from others who have tried to copy the style. She has completed many important projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can enter two more rooms at the end of a hallway.
However, there is a challenge with trompe-l'oeil art: once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. Sarah knows this well. She says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination. That is the most important part.""
Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal to the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas about what they want, while others do not. She emphasizes the importance of listening and understanding the client's vision. Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working on their projects. 
Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" 
While this may be true, you could never really get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be more widely recognized, and I am willing to take the risk of making her uncomfortable by praising her."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman looks at the important 'people skills' needed to succeed in your career.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged by a new standard. It is not just about how smart we are or our training and skills, but also about how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly used to decide who gets hired and who does not, and who gets promoted. It helps to identify who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future job opportunities. They focus on traits that are essential for success, which are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not as important anymore. The new standard assumes we all have enough intelligence and skills to do our jobs. Instead, it emphasizes social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are the 'people skills' that make up what we call emotional intelligence.
B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For many years, these qualities were called different names, such as 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills'. Now, we have a clearer understanding of these human abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence'. This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others, and to use these feelings to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice', but sometimes it requires being direct and honest, even if it is uncomfortable. Emotional intelligence does not mean expressing all feelings freely; it means managing feelings so they are shown in a suitable and effective way, helping people work together towards common goals.
C. More businesses are realizing that promoting emotional intelligence is an important part of management. The more complex a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. A lack of these skills can limit a person's ability to use their technical knowledge. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that encourage collaboration have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer focus are important, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.
D. While a person's IQ does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we go through life and learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and add these skills to our toolkit for success, especially now when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, nor does it guarantee success. However, if we ignore the human aspect, nothing else will work as well as it could."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed how people take and share photos. Now, journalists often look to social networks for images during fast-moving events. However, some reporters have used content created by users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, but people still debate if this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take photos or videos of a news event, which means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure that people are fairly rewarded for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health issues, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.
**A. What is it about?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller meridians that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. Acupuncturists use very thin needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.
**B. Over three hundred points**  
The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine that provides electrical stimulation. Acupuncturists believe this sensation means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less frequently.
**C. Science explains how it works**  
Even though many doctors do not accept the ideas of traditional Chinese medicine, they agree that acupuncture can help relieve pain. They have found scientific reasons for its effectiveness. For example, it is thought that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some scientists believe that acupuncture points can release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.
**D. What types of pain can be treated?**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. Commonly treated pains include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**E. Modern use of an ancient treatment**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture has real benefits. Today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries in China, from tonsil removals to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. While some people report little to no pain, experiences can vary. Many might find the idea of being awake during surgery unappealing, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of traditional anesthesia, like nausea, and recovery is often quicker.
**F. Effectiveness**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is challenging to conduct clinical trials for acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate. They understand that it may not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement can be felt after just two or three visits.
**G. A different approach to pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists look at their patients as a whole, not just focusing on specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues with the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect the pain, such as weather conditions. These details are important in deciding how to use acupuncture for treatment, which is not something most medical doctors would typically consider.
**H. Traditional or not?**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional Chinese medicine is necessary for deep healing, which can be hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P. D. James is a well-known crime writer, whose gentle appearance hides a deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she has a strong presence that makes you think she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school if she hadn’t become a writer. However, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in solitude. She needs privacy to write and can do it anywhere as long as she is alone.
Although she is often called Britain’s best-known crime writer, she is too humble to agree. Her 12 detective novels are read by millions around the world. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James often reads books by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she believes were the best novelists of their time.
P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, who was a university student. She chose Cambridge as the setting for one of her books, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman. 
Her life has not always been easy. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill. She had to work long hours to support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she had little time to write. Thankfully, her husband’s parents helped take care of her daughters during those tough years.
While working full-time in the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She managed several psychiatric clinics and later worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in the Criminal Law section. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she loved the challenge of writing crime novels. 
P.D. James always enjoyed reading detective stories and wanted to be a writer. She didn’t want to write about her own life’s difficulties, so she found writing detective stories to be a great way to learn how to write serious novels. She realized that within the classic detective story format, she could still create meaningful stories about people. For her, writing detective stories is a way to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is valuable, even if it is difficult. She believes that nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,C1,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can play a big role in deciding if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 
More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and as a part of interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not convinced about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. 
Marne says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental ability and whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a tricky or open character."" She believes graphology can be especially useful in identifying possible criminal behavior. She notes that criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which can be poorly shaped and childish. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and show emotional issues, which can be seen in their handwriting.
Marne claims she can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable workers. She observes that young male offenders often have very high letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can also predict if someone might become violent, if they are under a lot of stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even help predict potential suicides. 
She explains that heart and lung problems can also be reflected in handwriting. ""You can't make a diagnosis from just one sample, unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if the handwriting changes over time or becomes disconnected, it could mean something serious has happened."" A major emotional upset can also change a person's signature temporarily.
Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect in a ""thread"" style may be clever but devious. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting, which differs from standard styles, shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often indicates a person who is a loner. Very small signatures can suggest feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter ""i"" show a desire for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can indicate intolerance and a condescending attitude.
Marne believes it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific field, and she believes this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a person's entire history, including their emotional struggles, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""
Despite these interesting ideas, there is little strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical of them. They argue that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the type of writing taught, and that it has no other important meaning."
CAE_41,C1,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**
Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It’s surprising that this space works, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to what they do at home. This may be the key to their happiness: they have created a comfortable working environment without too many rules.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and creates bad sitting positions. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule, which helps reduce fatigue and boredom.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoys the variety of work and the office size. It is small enough to know what others are doing but large enough to focus on personal tasks. The office feels attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.
**Office B: News Service**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, partly because of a No Smoking policy.
- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs and lighting are good. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with plain grey walls.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve by arranging desks to make sharing information easier.
**Office C: Bank**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, with many people around. Despite some smokers, the air quality is surprisingly good.
- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and uninspiring. The desks are just okay, and not all chairs are suitable for computer work. The setup for computer screens is outdated.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. There are many awards on display, but the wood paneling and brown carpet make it feel a bit dull. The office is busy with activity.
**Office D: Newspaper**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and many people do not have enough desk space. It is also very dusty.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than an office. Many chairs are old and not suitable for people who are shorter. 
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old brown chairs and dirty carpets. There is a lot of room for improvement. The place needs cleaning, and individual achievements should be recognized. The air conditioning needs to be fixed, especially since there are many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations, and everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular, does not belong to any social class, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks of it every day. This ancient habit has turned into a big business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed the resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic to chew, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the chewing gum market expanded, synthetic alternatives were created.
Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, live a difficult and dangerous life. They travel for miles to collect sap from sapodilla trees in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One of the most concerning is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the ears and nose of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros can climb a tree quickly to cut the bark and collect the sap in a bag below. They then carry the liquid to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is made into bricks.
Life at the camp is also hard, with a boring diet mostly made of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though this work is tough, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the entire Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.
As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. At the same time, gum producers are finding clever ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress (soldiers in both world wars were often given gum). The biggest claim is that it helps reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid forms when we eat, and our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, which protect our teeth. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The hotel has basic facilities, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to its charm.
**B. NEW ZEALAND - Hermitage Hotel, Mount Cook**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After being flown near the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we had to walk down. When we reached the bottom, I was surprised to find this hotel in a stunningly beautiful and wild area. After a tiring climb, it was amazing to relax in luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter music.
**C. MAURITIUS - Paradis Hotel**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel goes along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are found. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find peace along its nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, you can hardly see the hotel among the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.
**D. ST LUCIA - Ladera Hotel**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most beautiful views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and located 1,000 feet high, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel has a colonial style, with mahogany furniture and four-poster beds covered with muslin netting.
**E. TURKEY - The Splendid Hotel, Istanbul**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is a great place to escape the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very peaceful. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings. The Splendid Hotel is all made of wood, painted white with red domes, and is inspired by a hotel from the French Riviera. Although it is a bit old, it still has a lot of charm.
**F. FRANCE - Chateau d'Etoges, Epernay**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with two swans, the chateau has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, plus complimentary champagne.
**G. KENYA - The Fairview Hotel, Nairobi**  
The Fairview Hotel is a comfortable place in Africa that avoids unnecessary luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers resting after a safari and planning their next adventure. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and rooms, and decide to stay longer. There are even apartments for those who want to stay for months. The hotel is set on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, making it a great spot to enjoy the African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.
**H. ITALY - Hotel Splendido, Portofino**  
The Hotel Splendido was first signed by the Duke of Windsor. Since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet wealthy guests, but the hotel, which was once a monastery, is still splendid. It offers simple but delicious food and beautiful Persian rugs, making it a perfect place for a weekend getaway."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from a hotel with three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.
Before they even enter, Sue feels something is off. The entrance from the car park is through a door with a buzzer, and the long, empty corridor leading to the hotel does not meet her expectations. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" It turns out that most of the hotel’s 15 rooms are empty that night. The only available room is on the top floor, but Sue does not like it. It feels stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.
When Sue started her career, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and did not think she was very tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge, saying there might be a blocked drain.
Sue suggests that he should not let guests into that lounge and instead guide them to another one. Greaves listens and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and seems unsure about Sue’s advice. However, not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, for their good service and knowledge about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which makes Greaves hopeful. He asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.
Sue’s job is to tell the truth about the hotel, even if it is uncomfortable. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served her apple pie with his fingers. Some letters she receives include false claims about her attitude or demands for bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says. 
Sue must share her findings with the hotel owner verbally and also write a full report. The hotels pay for her services to help them improve. Fortunately for Greaves, Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in two months to check if the problems have been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,C1,"**Seven Summits: Climbing the Highest Mountains**
Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While climbing Mt. Everest, Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, which Doug found odd since they were alone. He thought it might be due to low oxygen levels. Doug began talking to his own feet, which were getting cold. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug remembered their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is known as one of the most dangerous mountains. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized how big their task was. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new route to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a new approach for this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was soaked, and they were both suffering. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude. Finally, they reached the summit and celebrated their success.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro after getting a free ride. They got lost in the jungles at the base, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found arrows painted on trees that led them to a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who suggested they join his group to climb a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to take the standard route instead. The wind was strong as they reached the summit, and they camped outside a refuge that night. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, which made Doug consider this goal seriously for the first time.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, and the atmosphere is very refreshing. On December 7, they set off for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was very low due to a storm.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg and traveled to Elbrus. They had to pay a fee to their guide for bringing foreigners into the area, but it was later waived. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, they climbed, and the weather improved. Two team members went ahead while Doug and another member climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"
