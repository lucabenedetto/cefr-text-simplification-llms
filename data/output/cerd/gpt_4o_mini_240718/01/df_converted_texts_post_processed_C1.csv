CPE_15,C2,"**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we handle rubbish is quite similar. Municipal refuse collection happens regularly, where rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to a local dump. Economists find this system strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, which increases costs for local authorities.
The basic economic problem is that if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to charge households for the cost of disposing of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling points. However, research by economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman shows that this logical approach can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results.
Their research looked at several American towns that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these tags are collected each week. In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman focused on a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 residents. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors found that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of those running the program.
Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people crammed more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfill sites. The actual weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs, only fell by 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.
Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. While it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already participating in a voluntary recycling program.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman examined the economics of rubbish in greater detail. They found that while pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish quantity by 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.
This raises the question of whether other factors, such as income and education, are just as important as price. For example, wealthier towns tend to produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the outcomes are not as positive as we hope."
CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Change: Insights from Theodore Zeldin**
Theodore Zeldin explores how our work lives might change in the future. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Simply being successful in your career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even those who are famous often feel bitterness despite their success. In the past, enjoying your work was enough to be part of a lucky few. Now, it’s important to consider how your job affects you as a person, including your mind, character, and relationships. This is a vital question. 
No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you dull and unable to connect with others outside your field, or if you are so focused on details that you lack time for wisdom, creativity, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for this lack of personal fulfillment. I am trying to find ways for work to prioritize personal satisfaction instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, help us discover hidden talents, and foster diverse human connections.
However, changing this system will not eliminate unemployment. This is too simple a goal because as more people become educated, they seek jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. We should view a lifetime of work as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. Even middle-class jobs, which once seemed liberating, now often feel stressful. For example, doctors may feel more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely get to use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values align with those of their organizations.
I have started a study of various occupations to see how they shape and sometimes harm individuals. I have looked at how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am concentrating on finding more fulfilling ways to earn a living. While many experts focus on increasing profits for companies, we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider what kind of people we want to work with.
How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice? For instance, in the hospitality industry, which employs 10% of the workforce, there is a huge amount of untapped potential. Many intelligent and energetic people endure low pay and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz, which represented a 19th-century idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other.
Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they often have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers that actively connect guests with the city and create genuine relationships. Hotel owners could utilize the knowledge of their student employees instead of assigning them only basic tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would discover many additional services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 
It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and to move beyond traditional categories. For me, work is about relationships. As many people seek more than just obedience in their jobs and view work as a way to express independence, they should have the opportunity to design their own roles and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with minds that may initially seem very different.
Everyone understands the importance of communication, but true conversation is different. Traditional conversation differs from the new kind of interaction that many people feel is lacking today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between participants, allowing for a deeper understanding of one another. It is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Each meaningful conversation we have can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a successful outcome, assuming the right conditions are present. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.
We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is connected to two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting was closely linked not only to strong economic interests but also to the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly used for public entertainment in the USA and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public places rather than at home, especially in Britain and Germany.
The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. However, these systems did not pose a real threat to the rise of domestic television. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide audience at home was the most effective way to organize the medium.
As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of a home filled with entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, there was more centralization of wealth and political power, and traditional communities broke apart, leading to new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.
Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently communicate important information to all citizens. It also served as a tool for creating a unified 'imagined community' within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television.
However, it is important to recognize the positive view of broadcasting as a social tool that can support democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries focused on broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed and active participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is evolving, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is natural to want to create a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities, often sending the message that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive advertisements constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all encouraging us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research institutions and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living organisms. Caves are a small but intriguing part of the natural world, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.
**Weather Watch**
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans can. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-experts to understand, and it may seem like there is no place for simple weather knowledge. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is primarily about music, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.
At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching athletes; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate an actor's skill and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though actors frequently get asked how they memorize their lines. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often meet on more equal ground, regardless of how challenging the material is.
The question is whether music can learn from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can, especially because I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humor, and intimacy. It connects with the audience not just as individuals but as a group. The traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.
On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also interrupt the flow of the performance. 
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. It was a powerful musical experience where the skills and generosity of the musicians were central, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just spectators but also participants.
What I hope for in music is a bit more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in a conventional way, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.
As an enthusiast of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to thrive and for more people to enjoy the pleasure I find in being part of the audience."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I do not enjoy it in its natural form. To me, it is mostly an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can even swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days, you will find sand spilling out of your shoes and making a mess when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than many illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.
**Lock and Key**  
The desire for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. While old wooden beams have been replaced by electronic locks that use plastic cards, the need to keep out intruders remains. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locking systems that use smart cards to control electronic locks. However, people do not seem to like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of using a physical key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I understood more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, the goal is not to analyze art like a school essay but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has never worked for me. The new gallery has tried to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that explain the context and meaning of each piece. Instead of just staring at the art as I used to, these explanations helped me gain a better understanding."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films usually means reducing, condensing, and removing parts of the original story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses. 
In novels, repetition can include reminding readers of character traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help readers understand better. In dialogue, we can often guess who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. Stage plays, which mainly consist of dialogue, mimic real speech with varying levels of style. In some modern plays, the dialogue can become overly repetitive, serving only to connect the speakers without clearly communicating anything.
**Watching Movies**
When watching movies, people can feel completely immersed in the film's world. This experience allows viewers to escape from reality for the duration of the movie. However, once the lights come on, this illusion ends, and viewers return to the real world. People often do not feel accountable for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality can lead to a lack of serious consideration of movies as an art form. Many from previous generations, including our parents and teachers, viewed movies as mere entertainment rather than art. While they enjoyed being entertained, they did not appreciate the artistic value of films.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios consisted of many different buildings that were confusingly arranged. There were a few recognizable places, like the Script Department, but most of the studio was made up of small, similarly furnished rooms. These rooms were used for both official and unofficial meetings and could only be identified by a strange system of letters and numbers. Finding a specific room without help was quite challenging. 
The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances instead, which made it even more confusing for newcomers. However, there were not many outsiders, as the organization preferred to keep them away. It was assumed that employees could navigate the studio without issues. Through their hard work, they created films that allowed couples like Jane and George, and Sally and Dick, to escape their everyday problems for at least three hours.
**Film-Makers**
It seems that almost everyone wants to make a movie. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and many universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that provide equipment like the handheld camera used by Robert Rodriguez to create his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched his career as an independent director. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to make his breakthrough film before turning 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.
In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning the craft by directing low-budget films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to work independently."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western part of the city, with many rows of small, shabby homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the air was filled with a strange smell of sulphur from the May and Baker factory, which was two miles away. One common sight in that area of Norwich in the early morning was a paperboy making a face of disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 
There are also other memories, like my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the towers of a large mansion in Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never fully understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that her personality was unusual. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 
Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was not common in our neighborhood. This sometimes led to intense spring-cleaning sessions or her telling us to ""behave properly."" I never fully understood her moral code, which included not wandering into neighbors' gardens or risking their rose bushes while walking down the street. It meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio shows that my mother liked. There were many rules and restrictions.
Over time, other figures appeared in these serious early memories. Despite her loneliness, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that this trio was not good company. They often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I belonged to.
Reflecting on this, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" was on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a strict routine. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and bothered your parents. I remember long, aimless days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats, but my mother usually let me go with other kids in the street.
If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was a vague old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and once there was a charity fair at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" 
My mother often talked about how people had mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she likely imagined it as a fancy post office where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible citizens. I might be exaggerating and overlooking her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. However, there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been taken from her.
To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn’t completely dislike this activity and eventually began to form opinions about the art. I remember one time she stopped in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and said, ""Well, I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small grooves in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I often skated or scooted over.
As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and surprisingly, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents organized their spaces and lived with the lingering smells of the products.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be lifted from trains nearby. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. He explained, ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was difficult to relax or focus on work when everything was visible.""
To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and directed attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also contains sentimental furniture from his parents or items he found at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life and writing are filled with secrets and contradictions, making him a fascinating figure. He was a brilliant and unique writer, known for his first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977. This book changed travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insights of great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction; he often changed details to create a more engaging story or to highlight the idea that travel can reveal hidden histories meant to inspire future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam breaststroke, my eyes were just above the water. Each raindrop created a small fountain that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain intensified, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the pool as if it were reaching for the sky. It was during this heavy rain in the summer of 1996 that I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, escaping the frustration of my usual routine, like a tiger pacing in a cage.
Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path and breaking free from the official narrative. A swimming journey would let me explore the parts of our world that still hold mystery, like darkness, foggy woods, or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent studies suggest he was likely mistaken. Scientists now emphasize the social importance of crying, with psychiatrist John Bowlby noting its role in forming the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 
Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. The sound of crying seems to matter less than the visual message it sends. Crying may have helped early human groups by fostering trust and social connections. 
There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for someone facing great injustice. Sometimes, tears come unexpectedly, even when we feel embarrassed, such as when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We often cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying is clear, but research on this topic is ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some understanding of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support a population of six billion. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. 
Over the last century, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising gas levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict the current and future situations. 
We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last hundred years. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution.
A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models simplify reality and have many limitations. Their predictions are only rough estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. 
Despite these challenges, most experts agree on one crucial point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the world we will live in over the next few generations. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15 to 95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas.
These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humanity. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential resources for society. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. 
In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops.
However, many predicted effects of future warming are concerning. Even small climate changes can affect water availability, either through long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to arise first in dry regions and areas where demand or pollution have already caused shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades.
Another negative effect is the change in glacial processes, which will impact ice in glaciers, the ground, and the sea. This will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.
Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will happen because warmer water expands and because of melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees.
The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands and for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. 
It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable, as they will help improve future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences. This separation makes it harder to understand their significance.
Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of certain artworks create established ideas that can block new perspectives. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When we isolate artworks from their origins and their impact on our experiences, we create a barrier that obscures their broader meaning, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then exists in a separate world, detached from the materials and goals of other human activities.
Therefore, anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts faces a key challenge: to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not separate from the earth but are part of its natural processes, theorists of fine art must show how artworks relate to ordinary experiences.
If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion. To truly understand artistic products, we may need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the everyday experiences that we usually do not see as aesthetic. We must take a detour to reach a deeper understanding of art. While it is possible to enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of the interactions between soil, air, water, and sunlight.
To grasp the essence of art, we should start with raw experiences—those moments and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something separate and special that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 
Today, the arts that resonate most with people are often not recognized as traditional art forms, such as movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the mistaken belief that art should be separate from ordinary experiences. In fact, the times when art is most appreciated are when it is closely linked to everyday activities."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a stunning display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows to surround their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be perfect social animals, setting aside their differences to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have a different perspective. 
When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping others at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we would find the answer in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. 
To the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions. It has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the direction of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and loud guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. 
This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as clever songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more emotional tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. 
The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, which is an impressive achievement in an era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. In the end, he bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life.
As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten.
When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. I’m mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these is usually either a junior member of the editorial team or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much power, but they are generally looking for something original. The junior hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced person wants to keep their freelance job.
If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in a meeting. The editor who supports your novel must justify its acceptance based on its quality and potential sales. They also need to consider whether you, as an author, seem like a long-term investment, which you should have assured them of in your letter. Additionally, they will evaluate how marketable you are, as this is crucial for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 was particularly tough: the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, consumer spending dropped on almost everything except essential items, over half a million people lost their jobs, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business suffered, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% decline.
While many people lost their jobs during this time, those who remained in advertising felt especially pressured. They were seen as responsible for helping companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were often asked to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. 
As a result, marketing started to receive more attention from management, and some brands began to be marketed effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals, but it also added to their workload. Marketing was often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals increased. 
The early 90s marked a significant downturn for the advertising industry, partly due to the economic situation. However, there were also deeper changes that would not simply disappear when the economy improved. The recession led clients to closely examine their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies struggled to see the return on their investment in advertising, making it feel like advertising was on trial.
Client companies expressed a desire for better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work on their projects and to be motivated to produce excellent work. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for advertising professionals, it highlights that they faced the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
Several factors made creating effective advertising even harder. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including demographic shifts in the West, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising internationally.
These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those looking to improve is not readily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy managing these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often keep their strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some insights, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. They tend to portray the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Allure of Cooking**
When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This choice was unusual among my peers. Most of us did not see cooking as a desirable career. On the surface, it seems unappealing. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my studies.
My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected my appreciation for beauty. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was an eye-opening experience. I still remember my starter vividly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to kneel and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This inspired me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The swimming instructor at my school was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. On my next visit, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt extremely high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise faded, and I felt surrounded by silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. I thought to myself, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveler**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveler seems both strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through huge waves, and eating insects if there is nothing else available. They can live for months in uncertainty. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we often dismiss it as irrelevant. We can simply return to our lives with microwaves and answering machines, relieved that our own risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be an expert sailor, but he is certainly skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences on the water. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it has changed the way people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented about a thousand years ago, sailors have focused more on it than on observing the waves and feeling the ocean. As a result, the sea has become just a space to navigate, rather than a vibrant environment. Because of this, Raban believes that a sailor can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods, which may be why he has time to carefully observe the waves."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in classic books from the past or from different cultures because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, using words we might struggle to find. What is shy and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed by them, which is even more striking when the work comes from a distant place or another time. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are. 
Through reading and travel, we break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and this is similar to reading a great book, which reveals things we might have overlooked before. Our minds become like radar, picking up on details we hadn’t noticed, such as the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness we didn’t know we felt.
**Author's Note**
These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to restore parts cut by the editor, but I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have been endless. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer reflect my thoughts at that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in the moment, unaware of what would happen next, focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it, except for the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label covers everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through Australian gorges. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during those long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to pick it up again when I moved on, and my notes sometimes replaced detailed writing. Worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, I surrounded those sections with many warnings. Eventually, I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace the beginnings of fashion to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with what we wear have also become more complex. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly signifies. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.
**Writer**
Media reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. In my experience, especially since I am not on the best-seller lists, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that provide security, even if their books are not quickly published or made into films. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, leading workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the support of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our supporters at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not performing, it was hard to leave home without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our admirers, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, innocent confidence that only people who are usually shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick rise in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 
It is clear that access to music will keep growing, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, music is present at all major state events. For individuals, music offers many formal and informal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments. I believe that there will still be a strong interest in learning instruments. 
The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various jobs, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, there is growing evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one way to measure intelligence. While these findings need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help young children focus better, especially those with behavioral issues.
Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to better study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.
Looking further ahead, will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.
At the same time, more people of all ages may want to participate in making music, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions. If this future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require adjustments to the curriculum and how progress is measured, making them relevant to a wider audience.
Training for musicians will be essential. They must learn to motivate and teach students of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 
Positively, this change offers a chance for everyone involved in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is vital, but it is often taken for granted. Those in the music profession at all levels need to collaborate actively to ensure this perception changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work and personal lives in interviews. Instead of sharing meaningful insights, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. Discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is often evident in discussions about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the character's transition from boyhood to manhood with impressive simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with suppressed anger, displaying both sharp wit and warmth, making him both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.
**What is Acting?**
What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it create something new? This question lies at the heart of theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director's rehearsal method starts with a process called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, when the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a memory, like waiting in line for a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen without overthinking.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It can feel isolating if the people working there seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience, ensuring that everyone feels engaged. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should support the human voice and body. If the space feels too large, it disconnects the audience from the performance. Many theatres built in the late 1800s successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that have a sense of history, like old stone steps that show the presence of many people over time. 
When it comes to plays, you can't please everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want because they often don't know themselves. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older generations. This music opened doors for future rock stars, who listened to it with admiration, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for a whole generation of aspiring rock stars. Just like the young John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Liverpool, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show and was ready to take the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.
**Snow**
I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
Many books now offer guidance on qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of confusion about how researchers analyze their findings. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insights into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than creating a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 
There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. Technology can be useful for teaching our children, but traditional education still plays an important role.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, which is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. 
Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to escape Hollywood, wanting to work there but live elsewhere. Still, it remains the main place for anyone important in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a new form of art. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in a long time. This upset many traditional artists. After initially enjoying this new form, art critics claimed that photography could not be considered art because it was too dependent on reality and mechanical processes. 
Despite the criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils—to interpret the world and show nature, objects, and people.
**Book Illustration**
During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was clear that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, although the number of these books decreased over time. The children's publishing industry was active but mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality works, even though the best artists always gave their best effort. 
As a result, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable works, making it a great place for research or casual browsing. Many treasures from this period are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this art form is growing again, and we can expect to see new editions of classic children's book illustrations in the future."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**
Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Look where I am,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences.
The internet offers many exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, leading to dreams of wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this online world, we often share personal stories and photos without realizing the risks involved. Eventually, we may feel overwhelmed and lost in this crowded space. It can be discouraging, but there is hope. The path forward has been mapped out by early internet pioneers who explored these challenges long before social media existed.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online on what was then called the ""WWW,"" a space mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his personal experiences. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with links, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking behavior, there was also a unique beauty to his work that many appreciated.
However, one day, visitors to Hall's blog found it replaced by a single, emotional video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, his partner told him, ""Either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall realized that sharing his life online made it hard for people to trust him. The blog was removed, but the challenge of sharing online remains. While sharing can be enjoyable, expecting it to make people want to be close to you can lead to disappointment.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman working in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which cost her the job. Researchers studying online behavior call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary tale about the risks of online sharing, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life wisely. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: just because the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Tiredness is often seen as a common problem in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. 
One main concern is that ""People need more sleep,"" says a leading sleep researcher. Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic. Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing they needed more rest.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns.
Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator where participants are asked to drive while answering questions. They always come in at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. 
During the simulation, one participant tries hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he falls asleep briefly, causing the car to veer off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
Despite these findings, there is still much we do not know about sleep. It is understood that humans, like other mammals, sleep in cycles. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries.
Scientists have some certainties: women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons for this are unclear. Some researchers even suggest that sleep allows us to ""travel through time without injury.""
Historically, sleep patterns have changed. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This time was often used for reflection or even nighttime activities. However, by the 17th century, with the rise of artificial light, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. 
The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making people work longer hours in lit buildings. Yet, in many non-western cultures, flexible sleep patterns still exist. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, constant noise and the need to stay alert make uninterrupted sleep difficult. It seems that people everywhere are struggling to get enough sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"We are talking about very expensive cowboy boots—really expensive ones. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I wasn’t one. It just didn’t feel right. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I didn’t belong there. 
I flew in from Denver just after dawn, thinking I might look like an old cowboy arriving from the sky. But that thought disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty t-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a worn canvas bag from the luggage belt. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and walked out without saying a word. 
I thought there should be some clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. Something that would make me feel comfortable wherever I went, instead of feeling like everyone was speaking a different language and moving at a slower pace. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 
I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have a backup plan for when he stops racing. I thought I had some ideas, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. I considered being a commentator at races, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also thought about selling classic cars, but that didn’t work out either. It was a tough year for selling old Ferraris, and I decided to step back before I lost everything. 
Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to listen for a few minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I really miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car, feeling the speed of zero to one hundred fifty miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. 
I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. Being somewhat famous has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to brag that they knew me. Young boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. But now that I don’t race anymore, things are different. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have plenty of free time now. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I noticed some little brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents enjoy walking through the streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best effect in our work, which makes writing a letter feel less spontaneous. True creative artists, who may rewrite their work many times, do not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful and showed his talent.
**Supermarket Opening**
In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, elderly people waiting for the opening of a new Superbuy store didn’t care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bouquet of flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the possible reactions of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do well at the box office. It was only when it was shown on television that people started to appreciate it again. *Citizen Kane* is often seen as a film that has inspired many to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went ahead and created the film. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who resembled Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he approached the project with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t really understand. Dermot asked her, “Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?” She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost a waste to spend the day doing nothing.” Dermot smiled back and said, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she replied.
**Title Race**
“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature often leads to amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more appealing or professional job title. If our desire for recognition is so strong that it overshadows our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I was always inspired by how light fell on different surfaces. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect shot, as long as I had film in my camera. My approach was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my way of working for a long time.
Once, I got lucky when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became very popular, appearing in newspapers and magazines worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, but I knew that you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life took some unexpected turns, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I thought was good.
This assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice payment for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showing the beauty of daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. I accepted that some of my best work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.
After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I wasn’t told. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna sounded like a great opportunity.
They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy summer trip with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It was hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. I felt excited as soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs. I was ready to take some amazing pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was determined to let it reveal itself to me. 
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The overnight snow made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral, which towered high into the grey sky but appeared massive at ground level. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room, and even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art**
Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed from a serious space into one full of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 
Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for many years, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. These are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering and connecting ideas on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from daily life with its themes of leisure and relaxation. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's lively personality and humor, which make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks depth? 
Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. In response, one could argue that his popularity today might be seen as a negative rather than a reflection of his artistic value. Hockney himself is aware of his limitations and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.
**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced concept. 
As a curator, I wanted to create a show that opposed this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse space for an exhibition called ""Window-shopping."" This was meant to showcase individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opening it up and poking around until it broke, creating a flickering display on a monitor. 
These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but I believe they complemented each other through their differences. While I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, I think it is important to recognize that art is often an individual activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. 
Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we are experiencing. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our enjoyment is complex. How we respond to art is influenced by our senses and is shaped by the values of the society we live in. 
While it is essential to appreciate our instinctive reactions to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment comes from a past view that saw art as separate from thought."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. This stone felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold first became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.
**St Ives**  
We walked quietly down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the center of St Ives, struggling against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows of the houses by the water were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark clouds gathering, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived during peaceful times or faced hardships are no longer alive. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these digital societies and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys and observed an interesting event. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby, who seemed interested in joining their group. If the stranger succeeded, the current dominant male could lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This made the stranger retreat back into the trees. The dominant male repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, he made a mistake when he called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself.
**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey conducted in the village of Felmersham, 70 cats were observed over a year, and they caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that this means cats in Britain could be killing around 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, which helps keep bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with great care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who often sleep near their owners, slowly leave their resting place to go to the reed beds beyond the water. They take their time, groaning about the tiring day ahead, until the leader finally steps forward and enters the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are so slow that they go almost unnoticed, but eventually, they are swimming, barely keeping their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on whatever green shoots they can find.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles on scales. Despite being on the slab, the fish appear alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors that create a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes and the chain around one fish add a sense of danger, suggesting an underlying violence in the scene."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activities. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The first pictorial records date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They might have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. It was seen as the peak of Western visual representation, with the camera working like the human eye to create fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used to fix images allowed for the capture of what we consider natural phenomena.
At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had struggled for centuries to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural differences. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as other forms of communication, like language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality?
Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear window into reality. For example, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes of those who use it have changed significantly. This change may be partly because photography has moved into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, making one mistake can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best advice is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify a point. One effective way to include a flashback is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward without slowing it down. Dialogue is also very useful; it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Avoiding excessive writing is crucial, but being concise doesn’t mean the story should feel incomplete. A short story should maintain conflict and action just like a novel, but every word must be meaningful in a limited space.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Most players make moves without knowing exactly what will happen next. They might see a few moves ahead, but often they play without a clear plan. As players gain experience, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. They start to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies. The same applies to screenplay writing; the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally communicate, as seen in how children talk. However, no child instinctively knows how to write. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human instinct, writing is not. All societies have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily become better. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but learning to write is a skill that requires effort and instruction. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end it with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to share what I know.
To protect the privacy of living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, and long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book.
I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians do by putting words into the mouths of my characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be dull if simply told. I want my book to be engaging, and I think I am justified in making it readable. A thoughtful reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.
Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe we can only really know those from our own country. People are shaped not only by who they are but also by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. These experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you can only understand people from a different nation through observation, it is challenging to portray them convincingly in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general approach. You can give broad descriptions and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen through my own perspective, just like my main character."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. However, future generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Today, the poetry scene is particularly complex, with many different styles, groups, and opinions about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 
A major discussion in contemporary poetry is the tension between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work in front of an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in various forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students, and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.
The impact of these events, where poets often have to perform publicly, is complex and can have uncertain benefits. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and creativity may become apparent.
On the other hand, dedicated poets, who strive to create deep and meaningful work, may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best writing.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to focus their attention. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes combined with music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this approach has its challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may also affect the informant's responses. Therefore, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from their childhood. The emotions expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may actually reflect later experiences rather than the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a few species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study natural behaviors in wild animals. Although these two fields have different focuses, they are increasingly working together. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. Behavior has its own structure and elements that need to be examined. For example, trying to explain how a bird builds a nest by only looking at individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experiences in social life that may make social sciences seem like common sense, each discipline goes beyond this basic understanding. Each field focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses different research methods, and has its own concepts. These fundamental ideas form the ""logical basis"" of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He also provided Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best designs for different types of buildings. At its core, his definition emphasizes the artistic aspect of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early buildings were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, even going over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, where there was a strong smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that Lily was driving without telling him. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early and returning by noon to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, although Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. Lily even overtook a couple of slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her concerns. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with its small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street with many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. She thought this might ease Mui's worries. 
While driving, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror. She decided not to add to Mui's worries. Lily carefully locked all the van doors and checked each one. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to look at the grey sea. He held his son close and felt a strong bond with him. Man Kee, warm and responsive, placed his tiny hand on Chen's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son in his own way, giving him a good education in business, which was Chen's own weakness.
As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and hope while planning Man Kee's future. He noticed smoke on the horizon and then saw a ship shining in the sunlight. He put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he struggled, but then he spotted it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It's small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I once read that if you dig deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, balanced it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t consider how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not want to just let things happen. You held the handle, helping me as I pushed the bucket away from the well's edge. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, confusing and odd. Later, I connected these lights to the cartoon stars I had seen when characters got hit on the head. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. 
You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I crouched in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. 
Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What was I supposed to do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank quickly turned into a situation that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 
Suddenly, an idea came to me like a lifeline. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, one hand on my forehead, then yelled louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then dramatically collapsed on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was filling in gaps, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone to look for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 
Looking into my father's eyes felt like staring into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing the world from an adult's perspective. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, his tone full of contempt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his expression sad and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my desperate lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, even more painful than my father's words. It made me realize that this was the mature judgment of my actions, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The moving van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust.
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was particularly focused on making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, helping in her usual bossy way, convinced that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.
Fred noticed Susan was not crying and commented, ""That's something."" Curious, Susan asked if people usually cried during moves. Fred replied, ""You'd be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They feel fine once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""
Susan could understand that feeling. If she had been alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before agreeing to the move. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house, and they planned to move it last.
Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first item brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, trying to get it up. Little Robert watched in fascination while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't! I'd rather die!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, especially since Francesca was destined to be a concert pianist.
Peter, her late husband, had come home to help solve the problem. They left the piano outside while bringing in the other furniture. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from the quay below, and with the help of a local farmer's tractor, they managed to lift the piano through the window. The children were overjoyed to see it finally inside. However, the whole process was expensive, and it took months before they could afford to have the piano tuned.
""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children became too busy to visit on weekends, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She was out of breath climbing the stairs. The thought of the stairs reminded her that the banister rails had never been perfectly fixed after the move. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but now it was too late. Any moment now, they would discover it.
""Are you all right, love?"" Fred asked. ""Just the piano left, and then we'll be on our way."" Susan moved away from the stairs, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. Truthfully, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless other items that seemed unimportant while they were in place now felt full of emotion, begging for care. She felt she might cry at any moment.
Just then, the piano appeared, being carefully moved down the stairs by Fred and another mover. ""Easy does it!"" Fred called out as they brought it down and out the front door, placing it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What's the joke?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was that it should be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, one area that became accessible to many was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 
Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it meant that readers could see what others thought about a book, rather than just relying on the publisher's description or professional critics. Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This popularity led to some problems, as many reviews were submitted each day, making it hard to check them all. 
Amazon had a team of editors who ensured that reviews followed certain rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that contained bad language, revealed the ending of a book, or referenced other reviews were also banned. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to misuse the system. For instance, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. 
One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive ones under a fake name to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their own books through a special link, but Amazon did not always verify that these comments were genuinely from the authors. 
In one case, a lesser-known writer pretended to be famous author John Updike in a comment, but it was quickly identified as fake and removed. The real drama often came from readers, not authors. For example, when James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press, but many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared after a few days. 
Despite these issues, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as beneficial for business. They wanted reviews to be a place for discussing books, not just casual chatting. Therefore, they monitored bestselling books closely to ensure that all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. 
One classic children's book, *The Story about Ping*, inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, humorously suggesting it offered a good overview of networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare. Most reviews on Amazon were taken seriously by their writers and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying. 
The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have genuine feelings about them. This highlights the importance of allowing everyone to participate in the review process."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these views for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to constantly surprise us. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes, methods, and qualities that are still present in today’s art.
We expect artists to be different from ordinary people, possessing special talents and energy that break free from conventions. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and often become frustrated if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This language may seem childish, but bear with me. 
After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas and then to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters without any fancy designs. The sign painter follows these instructions. The question is: is the final product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find success in one style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it can lead to disappointment among the public. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully break this pattern. 
Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world. This has resulted in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating atmosphere of this hidden world designed for people on the move.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to see it that way. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am suspended in a mix of memories.
I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The true comfort of my work as an artist lies in the fact that, in the quiet moments of painting or writing, reality can be reshaped and revealed in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, art offers a joyful way to confront the pain and struggles of daily life, allowing us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Listen, this isn't good!"" my dad said. We were driving back to London after I had just finished my time at a fancy girls' school. My father, along with my brother Maurice, had picked me up and I had received awards for Latin and for being the top student in my exams. After a long talk with my headteacher, we were now heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking. Usually, my dad was very talkative, but he was quiet now. ""You can't trick me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Isn't that useful?"" 
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious conversation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My dad knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 
""I’m not sure about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV dramas."" 
""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn't in the family business. You’ll go to Oxford, and after that, I doubt you’ll want to join us."" 
The truth was, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options for myself and wanted to explore them. But, like a coward, I didn’t want to upset my dad. I wasn’t as scared of him as Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 
""It's too early to know,"" I said weakly. 
""I tell you, you won’t want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It’s a shame because you have the talent—the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father had raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and I had taken care of him since we lost our mother. It wasn’t hard; I loved him. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a large house in London, attended good schools, wore nice clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and business leaders—and our home was always lively with great conversations.
""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 
""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 
So, that’s what happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, but only a couple of times a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. With only a few weeks left, my tutor predicted I would earn a First Class degree in Law. I felt ready and focused. 
Then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It’s really important for me to do well, and I don’t want to think about anything else right now."" 
I could tell my father didn’t understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined he was—the clarity and skill with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his own way, he was a genius, and I admired that in him. It made my own dreams seem less significant. 
""Okay,"" I said. ""I’ll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning something that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At the time, however, it seemed like a smart and desirable choice. Simon had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly pushed for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for an au pair. They could have found these in a suburb or a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel like it lowered her social and economic status.
Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of thinking about his dissatisfaction. He often remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner cooking, and his grandmother's care for the tired breadwinner returning from work. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, always involved in legal causes and content with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which depended on two incomes. Now, their hard work could be threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood after court. 
Venetia confronted Simon with intense anger, accusing him of wrongdoing. He regretted not leaving his room earlier, thinking that if he had, she might have calmed down overnight. He remembered her accusations clearly: she claimed that a client, Brian Cartwright, said Simon knew about jury bribery four years ago and did nothing. Simon denied it instinctively, but his denial felt unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty and ashamed, recalling the fear of punishment from his school days. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief. He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then or now."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she recognized it. 
He wondered why Venetia was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. Was her own behavior in court always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if rumors spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose to live in this place because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented homes were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me, even if I try to stay hidden. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some herbs to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. 
It’s a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window and comments on my gardening. She is a writer with several unpublished works, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. “How’s the writing going, Jaz?” I ask. She complains about how people constantly ask her about her work. “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down,” she says. I don’t want her in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. 
“So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you,” she says as she sits in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, pretending to be young. “I should’ve gone into teaching – writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “What are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel overwhelmed by the empty days ahead. 
“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. My heart races as I speak. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy B and B?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were kids.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. 
“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?” Jaz asks about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses while delivering her rejected manuscripts. I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, those who want to be good: a bit less self-centeredness, more fiction…” 
“Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say, sounding a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She once winked at us and said, “I’ve had my moments.” We were shocked."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. While there may be aspects of our national heritage that we do not like, it is still a part of us, and it is comforting to belong to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. 
In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, modern society has disrupted many communities and families, leading to a loss of this oral tradition. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our past. It is crucial to preserve these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed like a blank canvas for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not just flat and empty; they are rich and strangely beautiful. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other unique areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. 
While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to envision the Fens has its own logic, as they are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for most people to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers and have started offering similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. 
Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that museums uniquely offer.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve our surroundings is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that they affect everyone. This rapid change can make some people very protective of what they want to keep, while it encourages others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation because stability becomes important to them. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thought, a revolution that led to the development of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer understanding of the universe by examining the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
As children, Lydia and I often distrusted any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards for reading certain books. He sometimes included a few better books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter, good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the origin of human language is both secret and amazing. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad and reflects the fear of early humans living in dangerous environments. Some words in languages, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"", echo this ancient fear. Because of such odd theories, many people avoided discussing the topic, seeing it as a place for odd ideas. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become an important area of research. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who viewed language as a major way to share knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"**Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode looks at the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they only stay relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, the literary value of reviews is often seen as low. Many people, including the writers themselves, believe that reviewing is something people do only for specific reasons, like needing money or because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book. However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task.
Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a longer piece of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review of fifteen hundred words in a weekly magazine combines challenges from both short and long formats. Length is not the only factor to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. Additionally, a reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy.
It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not very fond of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novel projects. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. While some may think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, it is understandable that they want some lasting recognition, especially if they believe their best writing is hidden in those reviews.
I feel this way about my own work. My main focus has been academic writing, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce. However, in the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it is common for the same people to do both. The time has passed when academics criticized reviewer-professors for showing off or wasting time. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are also less frequent, partly because there are more reviewing opportunities now, and partly because the rewards are often small.
I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and for professors, reviewing helps maintain their sanity. It also serves as a reminder that they should communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may enjoy using complex language among themselves, they need to ensure they are understandable when speaking to a broader audience. Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is usually a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also engaged in another primary occupation."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes hit him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened in his absence. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.
Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There was often a small pile of letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink to life when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been violently disturbed, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if that happened.
From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his few quiet evenings at home each week. After leaving the busy office, he felt a sense of himself returning during his bus ride home. However, he often found himself craving solitude, wanting time alone with his belongings. Yet, once he escaped, he felt drained and waited in vain for a sense of identity to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that the unfulfilling work he did had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.
As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he began to question for whom or what he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and his thoughts would come and go without finding a clear path. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he might have recognized his own worth and found a way out. But he had been so eager to improve his life that he followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.
After university, he had tried to create a plan for a better future, but he was not surprised to find that his true desire was simply to get by. He applied for jobs he learned about from his friends, following their lead as they rushed toward their goals, unable to imagine that he could find a job that would also make him happy. He attended one interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. He felt relieved after a pleasant conversation with Neil, his potential boss, and did not consider the long-term implications of the job he was now facing. Neil offered him the job on the spot, telling him he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was not easy, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light turned out to be moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone in this. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify the tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will spoil. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math. However, others cannot be rushed, and if you try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be as unhelpful as trying to get a full night's sleep in half the time. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different ways work at different speeds and are suitable for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds of the mind. 
The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my body instinctively moved to keep me safe, and only later did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer does not have time to think about their next move. This quick physical intelligence can be called our ""wits.""
The second speed involves actual thinking, where we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and can be playful or dreamy. In this mode, we reflect or contemplate. For instance, sitting on a rock by the sea, lost in thought, is different from planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster ones. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury; it is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the quick mind and the slow mind.
Some everyday problems are better solved with a slower approach. Certain mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed mindset. Recent studies show that these patient, less deliberate ways of thinking are particularly good for understanding complex situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have obvious factors to consider. But when the situation is unclear or complicated, we need to use our slower thinking. 
If the challenge is managing a difficult team at work or deciding whether to change careers, it may be wiser to take time to think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and have sought to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have discussed the parts of the mind that go beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can accomplish many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognize subtle patterns, make sense of complex situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than conscious thought."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. It is a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but I struggle with casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful during breakfast. This situation does not create any practical problems for me, but at first, I felt a lack of self-confidence. I started to dread mealtimes. I would hesitate to choose a table, worried about the silence that followed when I spoke, feeling anxious like I did in the early weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes not from missing company or communication, but from losing the social confidence I used to have.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when we met, he would shake my hand politely but did not seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, regardless of their cultural background. He thought that if a film is made well, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock was very clear and logical in his self-assessment. He was a rational man and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing audiences scream. He did not engage in speculation or abstract ideas, and he did not explore his characters deeply. His focus was on film itself and the precise, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. The telescopes were basic, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have improved the production of almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have also been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
People today are facing ""overchoice."" There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products are constantly being introduced, making it hard to keep up. This can lead to confusion, stress, and a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in today’s economy, having too many choices can create more stress, less time, and more complexity. As a result, many people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a world full of excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and phone plans.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a unique group of guests at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rudeness of shop assistants, which some people see as equality today. I also find it annoying when waiters act overly friendly, as if they want to treat us like friends. I know many of the other guests' names because, like me, they have been coming here since childhood. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, allowing us to maintain our dignity and privacy, which is rare in today’s commercial world."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**  
The move of a remarkable production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I unfairly judged his acting. While I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life cannot survive. The exception is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms might exist there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers worldwide have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the quest for knowledge drives us, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. However, these scientists want to understand why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain it. I believe it is more important to focus on whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in discussions about the purpose of it all. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boil them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-made one. Instead of purchasing a sugary chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your creations, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would many people want to discuss business over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still scattered everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were only near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him closer to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for help. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.
**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, a story of uniqueness and strength. In her personal tale, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, leaving her with just a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, Karen realized she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she returned to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to learn something important in a small community, where her quiet life lacked excitement. However, she felt deep sorrow for Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, which earned him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist, but she has also started writing books for young children who want to learn the piano. Her performances are exciting and impressive, captivating even those who may not usually enjoy music. During a recent concert for kids, one boy asked her if she could play ""Match of the Day."" This surprised many experienced musicians, but Joanna found it amusing. She realized that, in the boy's eyes, she needed to play that song to be considered a real pianist. She played it and enjoyed the moment, knowing it would be a great story for her next children's concert.
Joanna is unique among top pianists because she cares about how children learn music. Despite her busy schedule, she has published a beginner's piano book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and collaborating with young composers. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists.
Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. She thinks that many music teachers focus too much on creating child prodigies, while most children just want to enjoy music. She finds this more interesting. Joanna has a lot of experience teaching beginners, having taught many children between the ages of 18 and 25 before her concert career began. Growing up, she was surrounded by children of all backgrounds who wanted to play different types of music. She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speaking a little French.
Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on TV. Joanna worries that some parents use music as a way to push their children to achieve, rather than letting them enjoy it. She thinks that many children stop playing because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.
When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good enough, Joanna is careful not to criticize them. She acknowledges that her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones available to help beginners. To make learning fun, she includes stories in her books and CDs. She believes that lessons should be enjoyable, allowing children to improvise and explore the piano freely.
As children progress, they need encouragement to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear when she was younger. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. She knows it can be hard to motivate children to play a piece multiple times. Joanna didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she learned to tackle difficult pieces. Now, she enjoys practicing and considers it essential to her musical life.
Joanna sympathizes with those who struggle with practice. She believes that people should talk more about these challenges. She suggests that whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, it's important to have a clear goal. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if you make mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent writing by hand. 
Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, it is said that emails have revived the art of love letters, with millions now being sent instead of just casual messages. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwritten notes.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed the disc to him carefully. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed a button, and the drawer closed again. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be playable to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let’s get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn’t answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point. He said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations, and this attitude is a form of egotism, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 
For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some tech enthusiasts argue that this quick reading leads to new storytelling methods. However, the idea of ""non-linearity"" is not new; many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a text in its entirety.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as it did at the Sotheby’s auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their correct drawers, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work.""
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any mechanical devices, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talent. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard skills, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact, as she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he usually wasn't supposed to be there. However, he had started to be there all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to being overwhelmed with tasks and struggling to find parking at work.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small amounts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, breaking the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.
Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge, a place full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. Even at the height of his influence, he was difficult to work with. He was officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine, but it never published, wasting the budget for many issues. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, and then even more to get him to produce anything.
At editorial meetings, Ian would criticize others' ideas sharply. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively recent development in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
By the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they often overlook other significant social changes. For instance, new work patterns may explain why breakfast became more important. As more people began working set hours, many had to start their jobs very early. Therefore, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors shape the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers interpret these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may understand the photographs printed in the paper. However, instead of just accepting the image as it is, we might ask if it truly represents the scene as it was at that moment. Does it show the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a larger situation in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal and set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life; you can achieve personal success, but you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me experiences that many will never have. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot to enjoy these benefits.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt transported into a beautiful musical world. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an incredible live performance. I reacted with joy and surprise as each unexpected musical variation came through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether it's love, fear, or admiration. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of important messages or omens. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my understanding, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Even if the old beliefs have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and sad. 
This connection to birds comes from a rich history of folklore that shows how people once understood the world around them. In the past, when people relied more on nature for survival, they developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, cultural changes can alter how we view these animals. 
For example, the red kite was once admired in London during the 1500s for its ability to take food from children. These birds were valued as urban scavengers. But soon, they were seen as pests and nearly disappeared from most areas, except for Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation and were reintroduced to help them thrive again. 
Our relationship with birds goes back to our early evolution. The first humans likely observed birds closely because they could signal danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The concepts of flight, song, and freedom reflect our own identity in relation to the wildness of nature. 
Some may think these feelings are outdated and no longer relevant. However, like certain body parts that we still have, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be difficult. This is why, in recent years, birds have become important indicators of environmental health. In Britain, conservationists are concerned about 30 endangered bird species, which represents not just a loss of wildlife but also a significant cultural loss. 
Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent different kinds of love and magic. Anyone familiar with the works of poets like Shelley or Shakespeare would feel sad about losing these birds. Yet, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 
Folklore is crucial because the stories and legends that survive through time create a strong connection to their subjects, more so than scientific terms. This connection evokes feelings that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their significance. 
The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me curious."""
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The main purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions were more about how easy it was to travel through the local area than about the actual distance. 
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, and even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always show true directions. 
In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their significance. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and location, so understanding the specific style used in early maps is essential.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included on maps. To achieve this, cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, they began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.
As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, attempts to create maps of known areas increased. Astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, which led to further improvements in mapping large regions.
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land's features for military purposes. This need led to the creation of contour maps. Other professionals, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also required maps for their specific needs.
Today, cartographers create maps that show various types of information, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of maps' importance in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival in cartography.
It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been a smooth process. There have been times of slow progress, interrupted by periods of rapid advancement, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the need for progress but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it is easier to copy existing maps, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be taken at face value as accurate representations of current knowledge and techniques.
The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide a valuable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and the surprising fact that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, unlike Andrew, my dreams were not life or death to me, although I might have felt differently if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of some of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for his work. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my genuine praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written that an unknown pop group had recorded, which had not helped their struggling career. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre very soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs. 
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. Soon, I was back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started the orphanages that carry his name. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger place. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried writing. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases surrounds a spinning Earth. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.
**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee, which was a big deal. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to less important tasks again. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to develop your skills."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are very few TV series that successfully capture the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, called *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong personality, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that British galleries have largely overlooked. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the prices of raw materials are falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low raw material prices.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles, resembling a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The only sounds are the machines working at the Bamboo Bike Club, the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes. I’m here to see what’s happening. There’s a lively atmosphere filled with energy and enjoyment. 
Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back a method of building bikes that started in 1894. However, many cyclists find the prices too high. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies costs around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price, along with the challenge of design, inspired James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to create a bamboo bike business that was affordable for regular cyclists. After refining their ideas, they realized they wanted to do more than just sell frames; they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. 
As a result, the Bamboo Bike Club has become more of a community than a traditional business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so they run the club alongside their full-time jobs. They offer monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 
As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner parts for the seat and chain. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process requires technical skills, and James and Ian are there to help, checking every cut and joint. 
Many participants are engineers, and the hands-on experience of building the bike is a big draw. Ian reassures everyone that mistakes are normal, and if you mess up, you can just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece has been checked for quality, allowing us to focus on the bike's design, choosing from plain bamboo, black, or mottled finishes. 
On Sunday, we spend time building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it. 
James mentions that their bikes are built with extra strength, using larger tubes and thicker bindings. While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique, and that’s part of their charm. Personally, I think bamboo bikes should be for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy ride. 
I take James’s bike for a test ride, and it feels light and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes the real joy of these workshops comes when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first encountered a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she recalls with a laugh, and she was correct. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend has started her own company. Dr. Gray's short book on improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry that, according to its supporters, addresses many of Americans' desires for self-improvement. However, it also takes advantage of these desires, creating even more needs and supporting the entire New York publishing industry. In Britain, the self-help genre has produced many books that are as questionable and dramatic as their covers. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too specialized. This is a blessing. As a new type of powerful editor searches for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is marketability. ""How marketable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it relatable enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions, then admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's already a big part of the success. You know you can connect with people.""
**Autobiographies**  
There should be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this agreement is often not fully honored. There are many reasons why a writer might hold back. They may have thoughts or actions they find too shameful to reveal. They might also think certain details are not significant enough to include. Additionally, there are more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. An autobiographer might believe that the ultimate goal of their work—revealing the truth about themselves—can be better achieved by creating stories that express the truth more effectively than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they might choose to disregard the agreement from the start, labeling their book an autobiography simply to gain the reader's trust, which can help them tell their story. This can lead readers to believe they have read a true account when, in fact, they have read fiction. This can happen without any intention of being dishonest.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective stories suggest that the rise of this genre reflects the social conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often serves as an allegory. The crime symbolizes deep human desires like lust or greed, and its resolution represents the restoration of order in society, calming its chaotic impulses so that society can function properly again. In Hammett's unique version, society is restored, but it is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal represent two sides of the same character. The private investigator and his target understand each other and share a strange comfort. The detective exists between two worlds: he is too honest for the criminals and too shady for the law. He is both a criminal and a competitor. His mission is sometimes influenced by his sense of guilt, and at other times, his desire for justice is heightened by his uncertainty about this duality.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his craft and hear his advice, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying to promote his new book. Neither of us felt particularly comfortable in such a lavish setting. Regarding writing in such an environment, Gould said, ""I couldn't do it; Trollope might, but he understood the culture. Knowing the culture is essential for being a successful writer. Science, for instance, is its own world. Only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't belong to that community and don't understand its rules, you're at a disadvantage."" One of Gould's key principles is: never write down to the reader. ""Make no compromises,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language, but you must not dilute the ideas. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers feel patronized, your writing loses its impact."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping accurate time. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as decorative garden pieces. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work after he delivers it. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts exhibition long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, making it seem like they had either practiced for years or had a natural talent. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint with the same speed and precision I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure didn’t mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they didn’t question the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they learned they would be staying there for their entire holiday, they became worried.
""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""And we can take a boat to Interlaken."" 
Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 
""I don’t know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 
""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 
""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 
""We haven’t changed our minds. There’s been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he didn’t know about any mistake. 
""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache,"" Dawne added, giving the name of the travel agency in London. 
""Is there a problem?"" a woman said cheerfully. She was the stout woman Keith had seen at Gatwick. 
""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" 
""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We’re in the wrong hotel."" 
Again, Dawne described the bald clerk and the travel agency. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 
""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover,"" Dawne added, mentioning they heard them talking about Darlington. 
Keith sighed, wishing she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" 
""I counted you, although you probably didn’t see me,"" Mrs. Franks replied. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many different holidays at various prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 
""What I’m trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 
""But we’re not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 
""Let’s see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 
""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn’t listening. He was trying to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then boarding the plane. 
""Nice to have some young people here,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith’s thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife, looking as if she were in her eighties, said they had the best night’s sleep due to the lakeside air. 
""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn’t mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point was to escape the needs and demands of older people. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly, the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and draw lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce must be laid off."" While it may be hard to see how Shackleton's experience of surviving in extreme cold relates to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives.
One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge and accept the consequences.
His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 
MacGregor explains that Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans when necessary. ""We've developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized,"" he says.
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that one of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to be patient, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix problems quickly. For example, if you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it is better to hold on and wait for your money to come back rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, if a new product is not successful, it is important to be willing to change direction.
Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another member of the expedition recalled Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were near starvation during the 1905 expedition, saying he would leave it in the snow because it was too valuable to waste.
