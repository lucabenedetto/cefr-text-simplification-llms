**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is quite similar. Rubbish is picked up regularly and taken away by special trucks to a landfill. Economists find this system strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfills.

This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to recycle.

However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that recently started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags are collected each week.

In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a program started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 residents. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors concluded that the benefits of the program did not cover the costs of printing tags, paying sellers, and managing the program. 

Although the number of bags collected fell by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people compacted their rubbish into bags instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfills. The actual weight of rubbish collected only decreased by 14% in Charlottesville, while in 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5%.

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already recycling voluntarily.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that while pricing does reduce the amount of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.

If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, wealthier towns tend to produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling.

Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."
CPE_19,"**Work and Change: Insights from Theodore Zeldin**

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work lives might transform. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Simply being successful in your career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even those who are famous often feel bitterness despite their success. Until recently, enjoying your work was a sign of being part of a lucky few. Now, it’s important to consider how your job affects you personally—your mind, character, and relationships. This is a vital question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you dull and unable to connect with others outside your field, or if you are so focused on details that you lack time for wisdom, creativity, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, helping us discover hidden talents and connect with a diverse range of people. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. This is too simplistic because as more people become educated, they seek jobs that are enriching, interesting, and beneficial.

A lifetime of work should be viewed as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its core. Even middle-class professions have lost their appeal. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients and are dissatisfied with clinical medicine. Accountants, despite their influence, question the ethics of their profession. Many architects lack the opportunity to use their creativity. Administrators are hindered by bureaucracy, and middle managers are losing their confidence, as a European study shows. Meanwhile, businesses and public institutions are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values align closely with those of their organizations.

I have begun a study of various occupations to understand how they shape and sometimes harm individuals. I have examined how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I am now focusing on finding more fulfilling ways to earn a living. While many experts work to increase the profits of companies, we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider the kind of people we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, having the theoretical freedom to leave but feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers as an example; 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. There is immense untapped potential. Many intelligent and vibrant individuals endure low status, low pay, and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not evolved since the days of the Ritz, which represented a 19th-century idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, yet they often have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, actively connecting guests with the city and serving as genuine hosts. Hotel owners could utilize the knowledge of their many student employees instead of assigning them only menial tasks. By paying attention to their staff's true ambitions, they could discover many additional services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 

It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and to move beyond traditional categories. For me, work is about relationships. As many people seek more than just obedience in their jobs and view work as a way to express independence, they should have the opportunity to design their own roles and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with minds that may initially seem very different.

Everyone understands the importance of communication, but it is different from genuine conversation. Traditional conversation differs from the new kind of interaction that many people feel is lacking today. This new form is more intimate, creating a bond of respect between participants and allowing for deeper understanding. It is more than just relaxation; it is the most effective way to establish equality. Each time we engage in such meaningful conversation, we contribute to changing the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome, assuming the right conditions are present. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this agricultural metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible substitute for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published detailed guides on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly used for public entertainment in the USA and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public spaces, especially in Britain and Germany.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have posed a challenge to the domestic use of television, but this challenge did not materialize. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most effective way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of a home equipped for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to more centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.

Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently communicate important information to all citizens. It also served as a tool for creating a unifying 'imagined community' within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television.

However, it is important to recognize the positive view of broadcasting as a social tool that can support democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries focused on broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It is natural to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities, often sending the message that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive advertisements constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all urging us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living organisms. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature that sparks our curiosity and desire for knowledge, leading to significant research efforts. Because caves are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where they impact our lives. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-experts to understand, and it may seem that simple weather knowledge has been lost, but that is not true. Human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is mainly about music, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.

At any musical event, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the talent of the musicians. A skilled singer or a flawless string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician demonstrates years of hard work. Watching top-class music performances is similar to watching athletes; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate the skills of actors and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though actors frequently get asked how they memorize their lines. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often interact on more equal terms, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question arises: does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humor, and intimacy. It can connect with the audience's imagination, both individually and collectively. However, traditional music presentations often emphasize a strict separation between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also interrupt the flow of the performance. 

Is there a solution? Yes, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. This experience was not only musical but also transformative for many audience members, who were not just spectators but also participants.

What I desire in music is more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some performances are presented in conventional ways, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.

As an enthusiastic supporter of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to flourish and for more people to enjoy the joy I find in being part of the audience."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I do not enjoy it in its natural form. To me, it is mostly an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can hide important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days, you will find sand spilling out of your shoes and making a mess when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than many illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.

**Lock and Key**  
The desire for a safe home, privacy, and security has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam used to secure doors has evolved into complex electronic locks that use plastic cards with countless combinations. However, the need to keep out intruders remains strong. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locking systems that use smart cards to control electronic locks. But many people do not like these systems. While you might accept them at work, at home, people prefer the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt anxious about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Perhaps if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, art is not meant to be analyzed like a school essay. The goal is to let art speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. The new gallery has tried to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that explain the context and meaning of each piece. Instead of just staring at the art as I used to, these explanations helped me gain a better understanding."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films usually means reducing, condensing, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses. 

In a novel, repetition can include reminding readers of character traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help readers understand better. In dialogue, we can often tell who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. Stage plays, which mainly consist of dialogue, mimic real speech and can sometimes include a lot of unnecessary language that only serves to connect the speakers, leaving the audience unclear about the actual message.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, people can feel completely immersed in the film's world. This experience allows them to escape from reality for the duration of the movie. However, once the lights come on, this illusion ends, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel accountable for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality can lead to a lack of serious consideration for what was once seen as mere entertainment. Many from older generations, including our teachers, did not view movies as an art form, even though they enjoyed being entertained.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios consisted of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable landmarks like the Script Department. Most rooms looked the same and were used for both official and unofficial meetings. They could only be identified by a strange system of letters and numbers, making it difficult to find a specific room. The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances that did not help visitors orient themselves. Strangers rarely visited, as the organization preferred to keep them away. However, employees knew their way around, and through their teamwork, they created stories of romance and adventure that allowed viewers to escape their everyday lives.

**Film-Makers**

It seems that many people want to make movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are competitions that reward aspiring filmmakers with equipment, like the camera used by Robert Rodriguez for his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 to make and launched his career. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to create a breakthrough film before turning 26, just as famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills, often working behind the scenes as editors or writers before directing. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to forge their own paths."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western part of the city, with many rows of small, shabby homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. One common sight in that area of Norwich in the early morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 

Later, I have memories of faces I cannot name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a grand mansion at Earlham. My mother appears in these early memories, and I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling just as alone in a crowded room as she would on a moor. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or her telling me to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I am not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street. It meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed. There were many rules and restrictions.

Over time, other figures appeared in these serious early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Later, I realized how poor their company was. They formed a gloomy group, often talking about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" was resting on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. 

Growing up in West Earlham followed a predictable pattern. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way. I remember long, aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats. I think my mother let me go with other children from the street for this journey. 

If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was a vague old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity fair at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" My mother often talked about mercenary motives, and she had the deepest contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, I believe she saw it as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible citizens. 

I may be exaggerating and overlooking her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. However, there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been taken from her. To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally, on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand-in-hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother was not completely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I recall my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small grooves in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I would skate or scoot over.

As the street sloped downwards, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents used those open spaces and how they lived with the lingering smells of the goods that used to be sold there.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick walls and large doors that once allowed curtains to be lifted from trains nearby. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for practical and aesthetic reasons. He explained, ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or focus on work when everything was in view.""

To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and directed attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also contains sentimental furniture given to him by his parents or found at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life and writing are filled with secrets and contradictions, making him a fascinating figure. He was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It reinvented travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he often changed details to create a more engaging story or to highlight the idea that travel can reveal hidden histories meant to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain became heavier, drowning out the sound of birds and creating a mist over the water, as if the pool was rising to meet the sky.

In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of my routine swimming, which felt like pacing in a cage. Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, which can make reality feel less real. This is why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and mysterious parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path. A swimming journey would let me explore the parts of our world that still hold mystery, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent studies suggest he was likely mistaken. Scientists now emphasize the social importance of crying, particularly psychiatrist John Bowlby, who noted its role in forming the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

The reason adults cry is more difficult to understand. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 

There are also other reasons for crying. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Sometimes, tears come unexpectedly, even when we feel embarrassed, such as when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We often cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research on this topic is ongoing."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people understand the basics of global warming, but the specific consequences are still unclear. A warmer climate is likely to change weather patterns around the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support a population of six billion. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human activities have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are closely linked to global temperatures. It seems likely that these rising gas levels, which are expected to continue, are already affecting the global climate. However, our limited understanding of the global heat balance makes it difficult to predict the current and future situations accurately.

We know that greenhouse gas levels have fluctuated in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 

A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models run on powerful computers and use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their predictions are only approximate, and they are slow and costly to run. 

Despite these challenges, most experts agree on one crucial point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs provide some insight into the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by between 1°C and 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15-95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns are expected. Scientists also predict that extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, will become more common in some areas. 

These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humanity. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the variety of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential resources for society. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends that have led to fewer frosts and less damage to crops.

However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, either through long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to arise first in dry regions and areas where demand or pollution have already caused shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one such example, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades.

Another serious concern is the impact on glaciers, which will affect ice levels and, in turn, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human infrastructure. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This will happen due to the expansion of warmer water and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences of rising sea levels could be severe. Increased flooding and inundation are likely outcomes, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 

The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."
CPE_66,"**Mission to Mars**

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. 

It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft may succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the work done will still be valuable and will help future missions."
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences, which complicates our understanding.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of certain artworks create established ideas that can block new insights. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When artworks are viewed separately from their origins and their impact on experience, it becomes difficult to grasp their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then seems to exist in a separate world, detached from other human efforts and achievements.

Therefore, anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts faces a significant challenge: to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from the human conditions that create and experience them.

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion. To truly understand artistic products, we may need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not consider aesthetic. We must take a detour to arrive at a theory of art. Understanding and insight are the goals of theory. For example, one can enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing anything about plants. However, to understand how plants flower, one must learn about the interactions of soil, air, water, and sunlight that support their growth.

To grasp the aesthetic in its most profound forms, we must start with raw experiences—those events and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy as we observe and listen. Yet, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something remote and special that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities.

Today, the arts that resonate most with the average person are often not recognized as traditional art forms. Examples include movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the mistaken belief that separates art from ordinary experiences, a belief that many theorists and critics also support.

The times when unique and distinguished objects are closely linked to everyday activities are when appreciation for those objects is strongest and most genuine."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a stunning display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows, surrounding their unsuspecting prey like skilled hunters. They appear to be perfect social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, our perspective has changed. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up suffering while others benefit. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are experts at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. It has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the sound of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showcased Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as clever songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more emotional tracks, such as ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, setting a record in an era of lengthy CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who held great power in the ancient world. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life. As an only child, I often felt lonely and would ask to play with other kids, only to be turned down. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that they would want to join me, and it worked. This was another lesson I have never forgotten. When I had the opportunity to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that resonated with me. I am not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I refused to visit. Ultimately, I am only interested in ruins, as I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. This review is usually done by a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally supportive and looking for something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves and find a promising author, while the experienced freelancer wants to justify their ongoing work. If they find your novel interesting, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor who champions your novel must justify its acceptance based on its quality and potential sales, as well as whether you seem like a long-term author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is crucial for a new novel's success. Therefore, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in the economy, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and many homes being repossessed. Every business was impacted, with some sectors, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in activity. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.

While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt intense pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies financially, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they had to do their increasingly difficult jobs with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to provide. This shift in focus has led to greater recognition of marketing's value, but it has also increased the workload for marketing professionals.

Marketing is often mistakenly viewed as a simple solution to problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure is on advertising professionals to deliver results. The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought significant challenges. The economic downturn forced clients to reconsider their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies struggled to see clear returns on their advertising investments, leading to increased skepticism about its value.

As a result, companies demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best talent working on their accounts and expected outstanding results. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for advertising professionals, it highlights that they face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

Several factors have made effective advertising even more difficult. Some issues stem from the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other challenges arise from ongoing changes in society, such as demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, evolving consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising regulations. Additionally, some companies now face the challenge of advertising in foreign markets.

These circumstances have led many advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" The pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising is greater than ever. Unfortunately, support for those seeking to improve their advertising strategies is not readily available. Companies and agencies have been too busy managing these challenges to share their experiences, and those who have succeeded often keep their strategies private. While conferences and seminars may offer some insights, many available books on advertising do not provide practical guidance. They often portray the advertising process with too much reverence, suggesting that all advertising work is of high quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for making advertising decisions."
CPE_18,"**The Allure of Cooking**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This choice was unusual among my peers. Most of us did not see cooking as a desirable career. On the surface, it seems unappealing. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected a deeper appreciation for the art of cooking. My first real understanding of this came when I had a meal at a well-known restaurant in London. It was a life-changing experience. I still remember my appetizer clearly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to kneel and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This inspired me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and making elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The swimming instructor at my school was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 

The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt extremely high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise faded, and I felt surrounded by silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I landed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. I thought to myself, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveler**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the certainty of living another day, the idea of a traveler seems both strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through rough seas, and eating whatever they can find, even insects. They can live for months in uncertainty. 

It is easy to see these travelers as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our everyday lives, and we often dismiss it as irrelevant. We can simply shrug and return to our comfortable lives, grateful that our risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is likely why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be an expert sailor, but he is skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences on the water. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell.

Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass harmed the connection between humans and the sea. He argues that since the compass was introduced about a thousand years ago, sailors have focused too much on it and no longer pay attention to the waves or feel the ocean. The sea, once full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, the person steering the boat can often be replaced by an autopilot, which may be why Raban has time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two wonderful joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books from the past or from faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the writings of others, we discover our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can find the right words to describe feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, or they can express our thoughts with a clarity we struggle to achieve. What feels shy and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed in their words, which is even more striking if the author is from a distant place or a different time. We feel thankful to these strangers for helping us remember who we are.

Through reading and travel, we break free from the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and perhaps also when we read a great book, which reveals things we had previously overlooked. Our minds become like radar, tuned to notice certain things around us. We start to see the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a hidden sadness about a situation we didn’t know we could feel sad about.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to restore parts that were cut by the editor for space, but I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made further improvements, but that would have been endless. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer be a report from that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in that moment, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it except the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label covers everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful natural sites, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions behind this movement were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it was not as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during these long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and even then, my notes sometimes replaced a more detailed narrative. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded these sections with many warnings and hesitations. However, realizing that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook made me feel it didn’t matter much, so I let the story unfold without unnecessary complications."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought to be a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace its beginnings to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more intricate and important. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly signifies today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writer**

Media reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. In my experience, which is far from being at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that provide security, even if their books are not quickly published or made into films. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, conducting workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Nevertheless, by balancing part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the kindness of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, innocent confidence that only people who are usually shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advancements are changing our lives in many areas, including music. Susan Hallam examines how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a significant increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians.

It is clear that access to music will keep growing, as it meets many human needs. Music is present at every major national event and offers many activities for individuals, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether music will exist in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments.

I believe that there will still be a strong interest in learning instruments. The music industry is a significant source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media-related fields. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, a measure of intelligence. Although these findings need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to better study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Therefore, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

Looking further ahead, will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres emerging that blend different styles. Second, technology will play a larger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages may want to participate in making music, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions. If this future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to adapt to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and how progress is assessed, ensuring they remain relevant to a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be essential. They must learn to motivate and teach students of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 

Positively, this change offers a chance for everyone involved in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to elevate the importance of music in our lives. Music is vital, yet often taken for granted. Those in the music profession must collaborate to ensure this perception changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. Discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is often evident in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the character's transition from boyhood to manhood with remarkable simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with suppressed anger, displaying both sharp wit and warmth, making him both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.

**What is Acting?**

What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it bring something deeper to life? This question lies at the heart of theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal method begins with a process called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, when the line is about queuing in the rain, they might visualize a memory of waiting in line. This visualization helps them find the motivation to deliver the line. The director encourages actors to approach the scene with an open mind, trusting that something will emerge naturally.

**The Perfect Theatre**

An ideal theatre should make the audience feel their presence matters. Attending a live performance should feel special, and the staff should share this sense of importance. It can be alienating if the front-of-house staff seem indifferent. The theatre must foster a connection between performers and the audience, ensuring that viewers feel engaged and not distanced from the actors. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should accommodate the human voice and body. If the space feels too large, it detracts from the drama's essence. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that carry a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, reflecting layers of human experience. 

When attending a play, audiences seek something unexpected and imaginative; otherwise, they might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older adults. This music opened doors for the next generation of rock stars, who listened in awe, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young aspiring rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to take the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.

**Snow**

I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to give up my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

Many books now offer guidance to researchers on qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still much confusion about how researchers analyze their findings. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insight into the process of analyzing qualitative data, rather than creating a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves clarifying the hidden steps in the analysis process. Although this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**  
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur, pulling the noodles up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. When I asked him about dinosaurs, he didn’t remember much. There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. While using new technology to teach children is fine, traditional education still plays an important role.

**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world’s film production had moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as well-known as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a small village, focused mainly on films: how much they earn, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Many successful people try to escape the area, working there but living elsewhere. Still, it remains the main place for anyone important in show business.

**Photography**  
Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a new art form. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and they achieved this with new technology that produced images more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took much longer to create. This innovation surprised other artists, and while they initially enjoyed the new images, they later claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on mechanical processes. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new way to express themselves, using their tools like other artists use brushes and pencils to interpret the world around them.

**Book Illustration**  
During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was common for every children's book to include some form of illustration. This also applied to novels for older readers, which saw a decline as print runs decreased. Although children's publishing remained active, it was often low-budget, leading to many average works, even though the best artists always submitted their finest work. Thus, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable pieces, making it a great place for research and discovery. The best works are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this period is growing, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences. 

The internet offers many exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, leading to dreams of wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this digital world, we often share personal stories and photos without realizing the risks involved. Eventually, we may feel overwhelmed and lost in this crowded space. 

But don’t lose hope. There is guidance available from those who explored the internet before us. In the early days of the web, a group of adventurous individuals, now known as bloggers, faced many challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame long before social media existed. Their experiences can teach us valuable lessons.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness in exploring this new medium. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some may see this as attention-seeking, his work also had a unique beauty that many appreciated.

However, one day, visitors to Hall's blog found it replaced by a video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue of sharing personal information remains. While sharing online can be enjoyable, expecting it to make people want to be close to you can lead to disappointment.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously shared her blog's address with the company's executives, including those she had criticized. This led to her losing her job. Researchers have a term for this behavior: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary tale of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life in a thoughtful way. 

What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet allows us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier countries have become busier, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. This growing interest in sleep includes its patterns, benefits, and issues. A leading sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He allowed participants to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a significant need for more rest.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep habits.

Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a large screen. Participants are asked to arrive at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after a poor night’s sleep. They drive while answering questions, but many deny they will fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has recorded one participant trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and nod off. Eventually, he falls asleep briefly, causing the car to veer off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

Despite these findings, there is still much uncertainty about sleep. It is known that humans, like other mammals, sleep in cycles. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. There are theories that sleep helps repair the body, restore muscles, or rest the part of the brain responsible for speech and creativity, but it is unclear if this happens more effectively during sleep or relaxation.

Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons for this are unknown. Some researchers even suggest that sleep allows us to ""travel through time without injury.""

Historically, sleep patterns were different. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This time was often used for reflection or even secret activities. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making people work longer hours in lit buildings.

In many non-Western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. Some people go to bed for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The idea of a solid night’s sleep is not universal. In certain tribal societies, noises from humans and animals, as well as the need to tend to fires and watch for dangers, make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people around the world are in great need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about very expensive cowboy boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a concern. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I was not one. I realized that I did not belong there. As I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, I had to admit that I was not at home in the wild. 

I had flown in from Denver just after dawn, and for a moment, I thought I might pass for a cowboy arriving from the sky. That feeling disappeared quickly when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a worn bag when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and walked out without saying anything. 

I thought there should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. Something that would make me feel comfortable wherever I went. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. It was my passion, but I could not do it anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other identities ready for when they stop racing. I thought I had some options, but they vanished when I tried to reach for them. 

I considered being a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me. I also thought about selling classic cars, but that plan fell through because no one was buying them. In the end, I stepped back before I lost everything. Being an ""ex"" of anything is tough. Who wants to hear about how I almost became a World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to hear the story for a few minutes before losing interest. 

I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into a powerful racing car, feeling the speed, and the excitement of racing. I miss the bright, interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous had its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me, and kids would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 

Now that I don’t race anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks empty too. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have them. But I noticed some small brown birds in a cactus nearby, warning me to leave their nest alone. I had never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has much to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents enjoy walking through the city, and if you join them, you will likely hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like me, often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best possible impact in our work, which makes the natural flow of a letter difficult. True creative artists, who do not focus on the effect of their words (even if they rewrite many times), do not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a true artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not consciously think about how the use of longer words made them powerful and showed his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, elderly people waiting for the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to one customer who had inside information, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bouquet of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the possible negative reaction from William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite the film receiving very positive reviews, it did not do well at the box office. It was only when it was shown on television that people began to appreciate it again. *Citizen Kane* is considered one of the most influential films, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply created the film as he wanted. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who resembled Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he approached the project with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t really understand. He asked her, “Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?” She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back and said, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she replied.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature often leads to amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more appealing or professional job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overshadows our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually my main reason for being anywhere. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. My approach was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my way of working for a long time.

Once, I got lucky when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became very popular, appearing in newspapers and magazines worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, but I realized that luck plays a role in both good and bad outcomes. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life took some unexpected turns, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting location. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I didn’t mind.

This assignment came about by chance. I had previously taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showcasing daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. However, I accepted that much of my work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.

After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the chance to take his place. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna was a welcome change.

They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy summer trip with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It was hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. I felt it the moment I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs. I was excited to take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to let it reveal itself to me. 

A photograph captures a moment, but you must wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. Overnight snow had made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was massive and imposing. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers, before they understood the science behind it, felt this wonder. You can watch a blank sheet of paper transform into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed from a serious place into one full of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 

Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for many years, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. These are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering and connecting ideas on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it deals with themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some might even be drawn to Hockney's lively personality and clever comments, which make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks serious purpose? 

Some respected critics view Hockney as an overrated minor artist. Yet, one could argue that his popularity today might be seen as a negative rather than a reflection of his artistic value. Hockney himself is aware of his limitations and believes it is not important to dismiss his work just because it does not fit a traditional idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his significance.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced concept. 

As a curator, I wanted to create a show that opposed this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse space for an exhibition called ""Window-shopping."" This was meant to showcase individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats playfully chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opening it up and poking around until it broke, creating a flickering display on a monitor. 

These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but I believe they complemented each other through their differences. While I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, I think it is important to recognize that art is an individual activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking methods takes away from the enjoyment of a dish. 

Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, pleasure is complex. How we sense and recognize pleasure is influenced by our history and society. Our preferences for certain characteristics in art are shaped not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. 

While we should not underestimate the importance of our instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as a substitute for thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow pebble and picked it up. This pebble did not feel like stone, but it was beautiful. This could be how gold first became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, struggling with our heavy bags against a strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and every cottage by the water had its shutters closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark clouds gathering, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced hardship are no longer alive. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot rewind time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or the population and observe how these digital cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male who noticed a strange male nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could lead to the dominant male losing his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that signaled the presence of a leopard whenever the stranger approached. This caused the stranger to retreat back into the trees. However, the dominant male made a mistake by using the alarm call while walking across open ground himself, which could have put him in danger.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items, leading a professor in America to estimate that cats in Britain kill around 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey shows that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, who care for them deeply. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping near their owners, slowly make their way to the distant reed beds. They often groan about their tiredness before the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are so slow that they go almost unnoticed, but eventually, they are swimming, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. Despite their situation, the fish appear alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater feel. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including a chain around one fish, suggest a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been a powerful way to capture all parts of human life. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small things. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of our solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The first known images date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We are not entirely sure why early cave paintings were created. They might have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply been made to brighten daily life. Regardless, visual images have always been closely connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a way to create truthful visual records. The camera was thought to work like the human eye, capturing images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used to fix images allowed for the capture of what we consider natural phenomena.

At the same time, photography was seen as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create through skill and effort. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late 20th century, we must consider how well photographs can cross cultural boundaries. Is photography limited by cultural norms like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear window into reality, blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much, if not more, about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, making one mistake can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best way to learn is through reading a lot, writing often, and allowing your imagination to flow freely, as long as it doesn’t become chaotic. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can express their feelings through writing during tough times. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration to strike. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your unique voice, nurture it, and let it grow. Eventually, it will become strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or lengthy descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify a point. One effective method is to show a memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward without slowing it down. Dialogue is also very useful; it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Avoiding excessive writing is crucial, but this doesn’t mean the story should be too short. A short story should maintain conflict and action just like a novel, but every word must be meaningful in a limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Most players make moves without knowing exactly what will happen next. They might see a few moves ahead, but often play without a clear plan. Over time, players learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies. The same applies to screenplay writing; the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally learn to speak, as seen in young children, but they do not instinctively learn to write. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human instinct, written language is not. All societies have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily become better. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent a writing system on their own. Children are naturally inclined to listen and speak, but learning to read and write requires effort and guidance. It’s important to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and it does not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to share what I know.

To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book.

I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians do by putting words into the mouths of my characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be dull if simply told. I want my book to be engaging, and I think I am justified in making it readable. A thoughtful reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.

Another reason I feel anxious about this work is that the people I mainly discuss come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe we can only really know those from our own country. People are shaped not only by who they are but also by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. All these experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different nation except through observation, it is challenging to portray them convincingly in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general treatment of characters. You can give broad hints and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen through my own perspective, just like my main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. However, future generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Currently, there is a complex mix of poetic styles, different types of poetry, and various opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 

A major discussion in contemporary poetry is the tension between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and discuss their work with students, and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.

The impact of these events, where poets often have to perform publicly, is varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is designed for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and creativity become apparent.

On the other hand, dedicated poets, who strive to continue the best traditions of poetry by packing deep emotion, thought, and creativity into a few words, may not be appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest pieces to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their true style.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to place emphasis. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes combined with music (like jazz), is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's story is a clear reflection of their past. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and shares their experiences. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status and their understanding of the past, which may be communicated to the informant. Thus, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from their childhood. The emotions and attitudes expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may actually reflect later experiences rather than the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, studying how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who take the whole animal approach study the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often work in labs, studying learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors of animals in the wild. While this distinction still exists, there is now a productive blending of the two fields. Physiologists often claim their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. Behavior has its own structure and units that must be used for its study. For example, explaining a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized, which forms the logical foundation of the subject. These two aspects are interconnected. Although we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the logical foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early forms were not artistic, they contributed essential elements that influenced later architectural concepts. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, even jumping over a small bridge, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass by the gasworks, where there was a strong smell. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that Lily was driving without telling him. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early and returning by noon to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. Lily even overtook some slow cars confidently, making Mui hold back her concerns. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with its small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street with empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. 

Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the mirror and decided not to add to her worries. She locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were offended. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee, their son, to look at the grey sea. He held Man Kee close, who was warm and responsive, and placed his tiny hand on Chen's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way, giving him a good education in business, which was Chen's own weakness.

As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and hope while planning Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship appearing in the sunlight on the water. The sparkle of the waves changed Chen's mood. He put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he struggled, but then he finally spotted it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special little ship for people like us. It's small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily and Mui joined them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I once read that if you dig deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, balanced it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t consider that the bucket would be heavier, or that you might not be strong enough or willing to just let things happen. You held the handle, helping me as I pushed the bucket away from the well's edge. As soon as it was free, I fell straight down. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, confusing and odd. Later, I connected these lights to the cartoon stars I had seen when characters got hurt. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall, worried about what Mother would say. 

You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices from the castle's main door. I ran away, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I crouched in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left behind, from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small puddle. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had noticed them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but what now? This had quickly turned into something much more serious than I expected, going from a fun prank to a situation that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 

In a moment of inspiration, I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, one hand on my forehead, then yelled louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then dramatically collapsed on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out, climbed up the bridge, and walked through the passageway. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was filling in gaps, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone to look for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 

Looking into my father's eyes felt like staring into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time, and I was looking down a path to adulthood, understanding how the world and children's lies would appear to me when I grew up. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, his tone full of contempt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his face showing regret and concern. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my sad lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, even more painful than my father's words. It made me realize that this was the mature judgment of my actions and my father's, something I couldn’t ignore. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, with his large fingers, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was particularly focused on making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, helping in her usual bossy way, convinced that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan was not crying. ""Do people cry?"" she asked, curious. ""You'd be surprised,"" he replied. ""They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They are fine once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan understood this feeling well. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice such things.

The piano stood alone in the best room of the house, and they planned to move it last. Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day, but in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, and it had gotten stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours to get it up, while little Robert watched in awe and Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano in the garden while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder removed the first-floor window, and a crane was borrowed to lift the piano through the opening. The children were overjoyed to see it come in, but it had cost a lot, and they had to wait months to have it tuned.

""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and how the banister rails had never been perfectly fixed. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late now. 

Fred asked if she was okay. ""Just the piano left now, and then we’ll be done,"" he said. Susan moved away from the stair, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. In truth, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless items that seemed unimportant before now felt full of emotion, and she felt she might cry.

Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out, and they carefully brought it down and out the front door, placing it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What’s the joke?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was to make information accessible to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, one area that truly opened up to the public was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 

Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a review, it would appear automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, helping potential buyers see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical locations, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced issues with dishonest practices. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, making it impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors ensured that reviews followed Amazon's rules, such as banning one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's staff.

This anonymity allowed for some mischief. For instance, authors could write glowing reviews of their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several positive ones under a fake name to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article revealing his deception, after which the fake reviews were removed.

Authors had a way to share their thoughts too, by clicking a link that allowed them to comment on their books. Most authors used this feature to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their work. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not verify that these comments were genuinely from the authors, except for well-known writers. For example, a lesser-known author pretended to be famous writer John Updike in a comment, but it was quickly identified as fake and removed.

The real drama often came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as beneficial for business. 

Amazon aimed to keep reviews focused on discussing books rather than casual chatting, especially for bestsellers. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping*, which tells the tale of a duck, inspired humorous reviews that compared its plot to Internet technology. One review even made a complex analogy between the book and networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare. 

Most reviews on Amazon were taken seriously by their writers. Overall, these reviews provided a good indication of whether a product was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have genuine feelings about them. This highlights the importance of allowing everyone to participate in the review process."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these views for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be confusingly new. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes, methods, and qualities that are still present in today’s art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents and energy that break free from conventions. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and sometimes become frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist selects a text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This may sound childish, but bear with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in simple black letters without any fancy designs. The sign painter follows these instructions. My important question is: is the final product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule in the art world: once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it often leads to disappointment among the public. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different, and it will be interesting to see if he succeeds. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes he is known for with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His earlier drawings of Kings Cross Station led him to explore the underground world, resulting in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating atmosphere of this hidden environment.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only someone unwell would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old peasant who visits daily to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I exist in a state of reflection. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak of its comforting aspects. The true comfort of my work lies in the ability to reshape reality through art. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, art offers a joyful way to confront the challenges of daily life, allowing us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we cause each other pain?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Listen, this isn't good!"" my Dad said. We were driving back to London. He had just picked me and my trunk up from the fancy girls' school I attended, after sitting through Parent's Day. I had received the Latin prize and the award for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't trick me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Wouldn't that be useful?"" he continued. ""I also heard you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I explained. ""I couldn't think of anything else!""

""And apparently,"" he continued, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" ""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV dramas.""

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn't in the family business anymore. You'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" The truth was, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options and wanted to explore them. But, like a coward, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as my brother Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. ""You're not going to want to join us,"" my father insisted, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent—brains, courage, and vision."" ""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business.

""Anyway,"" I added, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and since he was motherless, I took care of him. It wasn't a burden; I loved him. Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and businessmen—and our home was always lively.

""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" ""Okay,"" I replied, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed. This was how he controlled us.

So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. With only a few weeks left, my tutor predicted I would earn a First Class degree in Law. I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. But then my father told me he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" I could tell my father didn't understand this pressure (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal in his time of need.

As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined my father was—the clarity and resourcefulness he had in his work, his energy, and self-control. In his way, he was a genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less significant. ""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning something that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At the time, however, it seemed like a smart and appealing choice. Simon had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly advocated for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate living quarters for an au pair. They could have found these in a less trendy area of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra room. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel it lowered her social and economic status.

Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube rides became a frustrating thirty minutes of resentment and reflection on their problems. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a child, remembering the comforting smells of dinner and his grandmother's care for her husband after a long day in court. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and content in her role. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which depended on two incomes.

Now, their fragile situation could be threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had clearly upset her, and her anger was intense. Simon regretted not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened, and Venetia could have had time to calm down. He remembered her accusations clearly: she claimed that a client, Brian Cartwright, had told her that Simon knew about jury bribery four years ago but did nothing. Simon denied it, but his response felt weak even to him. He felt guilty and ashamed, recalling the fear of punishment from his school days. Looking into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief. He wished he had said that Cartwright had told him after the trial, but he had instead told a more dangerous lie, which she recognized.

He wondered why Venetia was so angry and what her past actions in court had been. Was she justified in threatening his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if rumors spread, it could ruin him."
CPE_36,"I chose to live in this place because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented homes were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me, even if I try to stay hidden. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some herbs to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. 

It’s a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window and comments on my gardening. She is a writer with several unpublished works, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. “How’s the writing going, Jaz?” I ask. She complains about how people constantly ask her about her work. “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down,” she says. I don’t want her in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. 

“So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you,” she says, sitting in the chair while I place a cushion on what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, pretending to be young. “I should’ve become a teacher – writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “What are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel overwhelmed by the empty days ahead. 

“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. My heart races as I speak. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy B and B?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were kids.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. 

“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?” Jaz asks about her story, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other homes. I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you a little advice,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, those who want to be good: a bit less self-centeredness, more fiction…” 

“Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say, sounding a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but then I suddenly remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She once winked at us and said, “I’ve had my moments.” We were shocked."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage represents our desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. While there may be aspects of our national heritage that we do not like, it is still a part of us, and it is comforting to belong to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. 

In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern industrial societies, many of these oral traditions have been lost as communities and families have become less connected. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our past. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed plain and empty, providing a blank canvas for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not truly flat or empty. They are uniquely English yet also strangely captivating. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find oddly foreign, especially since many other distinct areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious.

While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict factual evidence. However, this imaginative approach makes sense because, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for most people to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should offer more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, similar materials have been made available to help elderly people with memory loss.

Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that museums uniquely offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve our surroundings is not new, but the rapid changes in our towns affect everyone. This can lead some people to become passionate about preservation while encouraging others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely mention Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, such as computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity,' which are famous for being difficult to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to contradict everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thought, a revolution that marked the beginning of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to develop a new, more logical understanding of the universe by examining the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basic concepts of time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier theories were based on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed framework of space and time. Einstein challenged this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

As children, Lydia and I were skeptical of any book that won awards because we believed it would be serious and, therefore, boring. While our mother disapproved of our lack of appreciation for such books, our father would happily give us small coins for each chapter we read, encouraging us to look at some worthwhile books. He would also include a few superior books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, clearly marked as 'This Book is NOT Literature.' Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books,' he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, on one occasion, to a famous collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, ""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous."" This fascinating mystery has led to many unusual ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is quite sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands filled with terrifying animals might have made desperate noises, and some words have kept a trace of this sorrow, such as 'malaria,' which means ""fever,"" or the Latin word 'mors,' meaning ""death."" Because of such strange theories, many people avoided discussing the topic, seeing it as a place for odd ideas. However, recently, the origins and evolution of language have become important areas of research. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and played a crucial role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its primary purpose, which goes against the views of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who practices it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including the writers themselves, believe that reviewing is a task done out of necessity, often due to financial reasons, or because writers need a break from working on their main projects.

However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review of fifteen hundred words in a weekly magazine combines challenges from both short and long formats. Length is not the only factor to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, ranging from casual readers to those who are deeply interested in the subject.

Additionally, a reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of content. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is somewhat critical of criticism, still engages in reviewing while writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how brief, into books with modest titles.

Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their work, but it is understandable if they wish to have some lasting recognition, especially if they feel their best writing is found in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own work. My main focus has been academic writing, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.

In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The past stigma against professors who write reviews has diminished, and complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are less frequent. This is partly because there are more reviewing opportunities available now, allowing many people to participate.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and for professors, reviewing helps maintain their mental well-being. It also serves as a reminder that they should communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may enjoy using complex language among themselves, they need to ensure they are understandable when addressing a broader audience.

Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary activity. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in other meaningful work."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened in his absence. The flat felt like a welcoming space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, reflecting either independence or neglect, depending on how tidy he had left it.

Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been violently disturbed, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if it had been.

From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office and starting his bus ride home, he no longer wanted to be alone, even though he often craved solitude while at his desk. The relief of escaping work left him feeling empty, making him question who he really was. He would read or listen to music at night, but he began to wonder for whom he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and thoughts would come and go without making sense.

He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself but found that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without thinking about his own happiness. He attended one interview with gratitude, not considering the job's details. When Neil, his future boss, offered him the job on the spot, Ralph took it as a compliment, not realizing it would lead to many more long conversations."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was set up for the race, not as fancy as regular racecourses, but similar in that spectators lined both sides of the track where the goats would run. It was a challenge to keep a few selected goats in line, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there were no places to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs, and when we changed the batteries in our torch, they didn’t work. We realized we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through your passion and enthusiasm during the presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they require their own time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. However, if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will spoil. Similarly, if you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can improve our speed in some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but other processes cannot be hurried. If we try to rush them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different modes of thinking operate at different speeds, each suited for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds in the mind. 

The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body and mind quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did I fully realize what had happened. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also cannot stop to think about their next move. This quick response can be called our ""wits.""

The second speed involves actual thinking, where we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical, conscious thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel in these areas are considered ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and contemplative. In this mode, we might daydream or reflect deeply. For instance, sitting on a rock by the sea, listening to the waves, or drifting between sleep and wakefulness puts us in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster types. Allowing our minds to wander is essential, especially when life becomes more demanding. We need this ""tortoise mind"" as much as the ""hare brain.""

Some everyday problems are better approached with a slower mindset. Complex issues often require a relaxed attitude to understand fully. Research shows that patient, less deliberate thinking is particularly effective for complicated or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems, like deciding where to go on holiday. But when the situation is unclear or subtle, we benefit from taking our time to think.

For example, if we are trying to manage a difficult team at work or considering a career change, it may be wiser to reflect rather than rush for answers. This slower type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long recognized the limits of fast, deliberate thinking and have sought to nurture these slower, deeper ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower modes of thought. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can accomplish many complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complicated situations, and resolve difficult issues more effectively than our active intellect."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. This place is a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated area. There are about forty people here at any time, including scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. It is a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful during breakfast. This is not a practical problem, but at first, I struggled with my self-confidence. I felt nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure of which table to choose, and I felt anxious when I spoke, remembering how I felt during my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes not from missing company or communication, but from losing the social confidence I used to have.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when we met, he would shake my hand politely but did not seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, regardless of their cultural background. Therefore, if a film is made well, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was always clear and logical in his self-assessment. He was a reasonable man and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing the audience react. He did not engage in speculation or complex ideas, and he did not explore his characters deeply. He focused solely on film and the precise, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have improved the production of almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, people face ""overchoice."" There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products appear quickly, and just as one is released, another is on the way. This constant change can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in our economy, having more choices can lead to more stress, less time, and more complexity. As a result, many people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a world full of excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and too many software updates and plans to keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a unique group of guests at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rudeness of shop assistants that some people see as equality today. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem to struggle to keep their distance. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, respecting each other's privacy. This kind of respect is rare in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I unfairly judged his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona distorts the tragedy, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. The entire cast is remarkable. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life cannot survive. The exception is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms might exist there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers worldwide have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the quest for knowledge drives us, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. However, these scientists want to understand why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this motivation. I believe it is more important to focus on whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in discussions about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boil them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-made one. Instead of purchasing a sugary chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your own creations, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our essential human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around tables. No one would choose takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would anyone want to discuss business over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and years of journals were close to new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He felt that Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, one of difference and strength. In her personal tale, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, leaving her with just a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, she realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she returned to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to learn something important in a small community, where her quiet life lacked excitement. However, she felt deep sorrow for Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, earning him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be moved by her performances. Watching her play the piano, especially with complex modern music, shows how she pushes her abilities to the limit. However, at a recent concert for children, one small boy was not impressed. He had seen her play many different styles of music, but when she asked for questions, he simply wanted to know, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised many experienced musicians, but for Joanna, it was amusing. She realized that until she played that tune, the boy did not see her as a true pianist. Of course, she played it and likely remembered this moment for her next children's concert.

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published a beginner's piano book for kids called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*, despite her busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and collaborating with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists. 

So, why take on the extra work of writing a book? Joanna explains that the first lessons in music are very important. Many people focus on training exceptional young musicians, but she believes that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. She finds this perspective much more interesting. 

In writing her first three books, Joanna draws from her own experiences. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. Additionally, her childhood home was filled with children of all backgrounds wanting to play different types of music. She was not part of a system that forced exceptional talent; instead, she grew up believing that music should be accessible to everyone.

Just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, Joanna believes everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children have a natural talent and progress quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on television. 

Joanna worries that some parents use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve rather than to enjoy it. Many children stop playing because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations. 

When asked if she thinks poorly of other piano teaching methods or books, Joanna is careful not to criticize. She acknowledges that her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones available to help beginners enjoy learning. Her unique approach includes storytelling in her books and CDs to make learning more interesting. 

From the very first lesson, there are fun accompaniments for teachers or parents to play along with the child. For those whose parents do not play the piano, the accompaniments are available on CDs. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. Children should be encouraged to improvise and explore the piano freely.

As children progress, they face new challenges. They need encouragement to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important factor in learning. 

How can children be motivated to play a piece more than once? Joanna admits she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a challenging contemporary repertoire. Now, she loves practicing and spends about eight hours a day on it, which she considers essential to her musical life, even more than performing.

Joanna empathizes with those who find practice difficult. She believes people do not talk about this enough. The key to practice, whether for twenty minutes or five hours, is to have a clear goal. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even with mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find that the time spent fixing mistakes in digital drafts is about the same as the time spent on handwritten work. 

Emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, they have revived the art of love letters, with millions now being sent instead of just casual messages. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not realize the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Quick, typed words lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD Experience**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed him the disc carefully. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it again. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be playable to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's find you the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question he couldn't answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing. They overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations. This attitude is called chronocentricity, the belief that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly fade away. So far, that prediction has been wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some tech enthusiasts argue that this leads to new storytelling methods, but non-linear reading is not new. Many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the kind of deep thinking that comes from reading a complete text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as it did when he bought it at auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their drawers, and twelve years' worth of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any machines in the room, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had discussed this many times over the two years they had known each other. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talent. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard skills, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he usually wasn't supposed to be there. However, he had started to be there all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to being overwhelmed with tasks and struggling to find parking at work.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and had a tone that felt unconvincing. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter for payment. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, going against the principle that authors must deliver a manuscript to get paid later.

Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge, a place full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre and succeeded quickly. However, Ian seemed less motivated. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. Even at the height of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he wasted the budget for many issues without publishing anything. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which increased in attempts to make him produce more, then even more to get him to produce anything.

At editorial meetings, Ian would criticize others' ideas sharply. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively recent development in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

By the sixteenth century, having breakfast became more common. Some writers believe this change was due to more food being available. However, they often overlook other significant social changes. For instance, new work patterns may explain why breakfast became more important. As more people started working set hours, often beginning very early in the morning, having a meal first thing became necessary. Breakfast was no longer just for the wealthy; it became a routine for everyone."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual elements based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors shape the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers interpret these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may understand the photographs printed in the paper. However, instead of simply accepting the image, we might ask if it truly represents the scene as it was at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured the most important aspect, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a broader situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports have always meant more than just playing. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal. There is only one path to being the best, and you must set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life—while you can achieve personal success, you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened opportunities for me and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things in the world that many others will not. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot to gain these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird’s amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I was drawn into a surprising artistic experience. To appreciate the bird’s patterns, I relied on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel as if I was enjoying an incredible live performance filled with stunning improvisation. I reacted with groans and cheers as each unexpected musical variation flowed through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds, whether we love, fear, or admire them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of warning or prophecy. Is it trying to send a message from a mysterious world, or is it just trapped? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Although old beliefs may have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and sad. 

This connection to birds comes from a rich tradition of folklore that dates back to when people were more connected to nature for survival. As people relied on nature, they developed a cultural language to express the importance of other creatures. However, this significance can change over time. 

Take the red kite as an example. In the early 1500s, visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take food from children. These birds were valued as urban scavengers. But soon, they were seen as pests and nearly disappeared from most areas, except Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation in Britain, and efforts were made to protect and reintroduce them. 

Our relationship with birds goes back to our evolution. Early humans observed birds closely because they could signal danger, bad weather, or food availability. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring our own identity. The concepts of flight, song, and freedom reflect our desires and aspirations. 

Some may think these feelings are outdated, remnants of our past. But like certain body parts that we no longer need, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be painful. This is likely why birds have become symbols of environmental change, serving as indicators of ecological health. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered, which is troubling not only because we are losing these beautiful creatures but also because it represents a significant cultural loss. 

Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent spiritual love, romantic love, and magic. Readers of poets like Shelley, Shakespeare, and Robert Graves feel a sense of loss for these once-common birds. However, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 

Folklore is vital. The stories and legends that endure over time create a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms do. This connection evokes feelings and attitudes that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we find in these experiences cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. 

The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding onto its song as it moves into the future—a mystery that keeps us curious."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The main purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between different points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions were more about how easy it was to travel through the local landscape than about the actual distance. 

Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the key questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, sometimes even more than maps. Today, some maps, like those showing train routes, may not accurately represent true directions. 

In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their significance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the content of maps. This development has involved other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows, stars, or wind, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.

As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, astronomers found that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas. The needs of map users also changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps; soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, required accurate representations of the land for military purposes. This need led to the creation of contour maps.

Other professionals, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific mapping needs. To meet these demands, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival in cartography.

It is important to note that the development of cartography has not been a smooth or straightforward process. There have been times of decline or stagnation, followed by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for advancements but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it is easier to create a map by copying an existing one, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be taken at face value as evidence of current knowledge and techniques.

The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide an invaluable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This young man, Andrew Lloyd Webber, had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and he had even bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the famous composer Richard Rodgers. 

I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as crucial to me as Andrew's were to him. If I had failed, it might have felt more serious. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for his work. I didn’t have much to offer him except my praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which had not helped an unknown pop group revive their failing career.

We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination. I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs.

The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I felt about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs that wouldn’t show my vocal limitations. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few months left to enjoy it. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that mimicked musical writers instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team.

I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t excite me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place, there is room for another. We could be the second hamburger joint.

I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which had likely been thought up by a friend of his from school. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that day marked a change in my career."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical rainforests to thrive, which are rich in various species. In contrast, cold and windy regions can only support a limited number of living things. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases surrounds a spinning Earth. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee, which was a big deal. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever thought I would about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I might be sent back to basic cleaning tasks. Fortunately, my boss was understanding. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop your skills."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A clear example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series, *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong presence, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to a type of art that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here, and Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches extend for 200 miles, resembling a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay also shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years developing a more affordable option in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to create a business that allowed people to enjoy making something unique and sustainable, rather than just selling bike frames.

Now, the Bamboo Bike Club operates as a community project alongside their full-time jobs—James works on wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. They offer monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 

As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner parts for the seat and chain. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other components that need extra strength. This process requires careful cutting and technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help, ensuring everything is done correctly.

The chance to build the bike yourself is a big draw for many participants, especially since most of us have engineering backgrounds. Ian reassures everyone that mistakes are normal, and if you mess up, you can simply try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each bamboo length is checked for quality, allowing us to choose the look of our frames—plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, we focus on building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap hemp bindings around the joints and use epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that these bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without any issues.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they have a unique charm. James and Ian emphasize that individuality is important. Personally, I prefer a bike that offers a relaxed ride, so I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth experience. 

When I take James’s bike for a ride, I find it light and comfortable, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes that the true joy of these workshops comes when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is also appealing—less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first encountered a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she recalls with a laugh, and she was correct. Dr. Gray has since become a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend has started her own company. Dr. Gray's short book on improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry that, according to its supporters, addresses many of Americans' desires for self-improvement. However, it also capitalizes on these desires, creating even more needs and significantly supporting the New York publishing industry. In Britain, the genre has shown that it can produce many books that are as questionable and dramatic as their covers suggest, but there are even worse examples. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too niche. This is a small mercy. As a new type of powerful editor searches for the next popular book, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is marketability. ""How marketable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it relatable enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions, then admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can connect with people.""

**Autobiographies**  
There must be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this agreement is often not fully honored. There are many reasons why a writer might hold back. They may have thoughts or actions they find too shameful to reveal. They might also decide that certain details are not significant enough to include. Additionally, there are more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. An autobiographer might believe that the ultimate goal of their work—revealing the truth about themselves—can be better achieved by creating stories that express the truth more effectively than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may choose from the start not to follow this agreement at all. They might label their book an autobiography simply to create a sense of trust in the reader, which can be very useful for their storytelling. This can lead naive readers to believe they have read a true account when, in fact, they have only read fiction. This can happen without any intention of being dishonest.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective stories have suggested that the rise of this genre reflects the social conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story serves as a metaphor. The crime symbolizes deep human desires like lust or greed, and its resolution represents the restoration of order in society, calming its chaotic impulses so that society can function properly again. In Hammett's unique version, society is restored, but it is revealed to be corrupt and false. The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's stories represent two sides of the same character. The detective and the criminal understand each other and, in a strange way, are comfortable together. The detective exists in both worlds. To the criminal, he is too honest, and to the law, he is too shady. He is both a criminal and a rival. The detective's mission is sometimes influenced by his sense of shared guilt, and at other times, his desire for justice is heightened by his unease about this duality.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his craft and hear his insights, I met him in an unfamiliar setting: the Grand Hotel, where he was staying to promote his new book. Neither of us felt particularly comfortable there. Regarding writing in such a pretentious environment, Gould remarked, ""I couldn't do it; Trollope might, but he understood the culture. Understanding the culture is essential for being a successful writer. Science, for instance, is its own world. Therefore, only those who are part of that community can effectively present it. If you don't belong to that community and don't grasp its rules, you are at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's key principles is: never write down to the reader. ""Make no compromises,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language, but you must never dilute the content. Most importantly, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers feel they are being talked down to, your writing is doomed."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it feels almost like the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping accurate time. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as decorative garden pieces. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, making it seem like they had either practiced for years or had a special talent. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint with the same speed and precision I had seen before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another flight. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses told them, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure did not mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they did not question the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, when they learned they would be staying in the hotel for their entire holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""And we can take a boat to Interlaken."" 

Keith calmly told the receptionist, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake,"" Keith repeated. The receptionist shook his head, unaware of any mistake. 

Dawne interrupted, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She mentioned the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said cheerfully. She was the stout woman Keith had seen at Gatwick. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" 

Mrs. Franks repeated the name of the travel agency and described the bald clerk. Keith interrupted again, ""It seems we joined the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left everything to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added, mentioning they heard the others talking about Darlington. 

Keith, feeling impatient, wished she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" 

""I counted you, although you probably didn't see me,"" Mrs. Franks replied. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many different holidays at various prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 

""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 

""But we are not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly, and then she walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then boarding the plane. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked very old. She said they had the best night's sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 

""That's nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they found themselves on a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly, the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and draw lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber stove, has become an example for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. 

MacGregor explains that even if a company handles a crisis well, poor communication can still cause harm. He believes Shackleton is a great management model because of his leadership qualities. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives. One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men.

In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton reassured his men, saying they would reach safety if they did their best and trusted him. His leadership was evident; he planned carefully, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions.

Shackleton was adaptable and willing to change plans when necessary. MacGregor notes that Shackleton's story resonates with clients because it illustrates effective principles without making them feel criticized. Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. He emphasized the importance of waiting for the right moment, especially in a fast-paced culture like America. For example, if you invest in bonds and make a mistake, it’s better to hold on than to sell at a loss. However, if a new product is failing, it’s wise to change direction.

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, without gloves. He insisted Hurley wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another crew member recalled Shackleton doing something similar during a previous expedition when food was scarce. He said he would leave a biscuit in the snow rather than eat it, showing how much he valued it.

As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, points out, there is a growing public interest in heroic efforts. Shackleton represents the ideals that many people long for today, standing out as a true embodiment of those values."
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye, which has a feeding style similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel into the wood and its long tongue to pull out the insects. In contrast, the aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unusual feeding method was first described over a century ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting abilities of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several narrow holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes quickly went for the logs with food, gnawing through the wood without needing to see the surface holes. This raised the question of how they found the mealworms. It was thought they might be using their sense of smell or hearing, but further tests showed they did not rely on these senses either. Even when the smell of the insects was blocked, or when the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them.

Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes could sense the cavities in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and listens carefully, using its large ears to detect sounds. This behavior suggests that the aye-aye might be using a form of echo-location, listening for echoes that indicate a hollow space beneath the surface. They may also hear the movement of insects when they tap on the wood.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are other birds, like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel.

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us truly understand their lives and who they were when they were young? The few diaries we find often leave us wanting more, and family stories are often only partially remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never seem to do it. We might leave behind videos instead of photos, but those are still just images.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardcover book of at least 20,000 words, complete with illustrations if desired. Her focus is not on famous individuals, but on everyday people. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of her own past was fading away. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now, after meeting people who have interesting stories to share,"" she explains. Many of her subjects say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they also find personal satisfaction in the process.

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share their true feelings. One 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure in his life, said, ""I was surprised by what I revealed. There were painful memories, like my divorce, that still affect me."" He wrote his story for his family, hoping they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let them read it yet. He feels there are details that might hurt them, and he prefers they read it only after he is gone.

Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their childhood experiences. ""It's surprising how much people are shaped by their parents,"" she says. The lessons and encouragements from childhood can affect their lives forever. Many people find themselves repeating the same patterns, whether they marry someone their parents would approve of or choose partners as a form of rebellion.

Many people express regrets about unresolved issues with their parents, even decades later. If someone had emotional struggles in their youth, those issues often persist into middle age. They may live their lives trying to gain approval from a parent who never acknowledged them, and some even seek permission to express their frustrations.

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Hannah maintains a respectful distance. ""This is not for public sharing, and I'm not here to pry,"" she says. Sometimes, people share something and then question whether it should be included. She assures them that they can remove anything they want when they see the draft. Generally, people want to be honest about their lives.

Hannah's work is not about vanity; it’s not about people boasting about their interesting lives. In our fast-paced world, we often lose touch with our past. Her books help provide a connection to our ancestors, especially since families no longer gather as they once did. People seek a sense of immortality through their stories.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to write the life story, organizing the events and interpreting them. Modern technology allows her to create everything except the binding, which features gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is well-organized and well-written, reflecting the quality of the subject's life. Each book costs nearly £3,000, with additional copies available for £25 each. Although she receives about ten inquiries a week, the price often discourages many potential clients. ""I thought my work would appeal to a broader audience,"" she admits. ""But the people I've worked with tend to be from affluent backgrounds, often readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for future generations."""
CAE_24,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a large collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all accurate replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery that has great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are significant: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view nearly all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work across Great Britain. These photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the impact of human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can assist with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased, made to order, and typically take about a month to prepare.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, making it one of the most unique tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, known as facsimiles, to preserve the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates served as an alternative memorial to tomb statues and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples can be found in Britain, with the widest variety available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, and while I can't say I'm proud of everything, I have enjoyed 35 years with young children. This morning, I fed my baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very fortunate with my children. We share many interests: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I see them more as a friend than a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. Although I have slapped my children in anger, I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them whenever they need me, as long as they reach out first. I believe that chasing them for contact only creates guilt, something my parents did to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young, around 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, which makes me sad. However, I now enjoy taking them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with my friends and join us at parties and advertising events without feeling out of place. I think my job, which they find exciting, has helped with this.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for our children, but as my political career grew, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they understand what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our kids in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think deeply about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was present, but like many parents from the Seventies, I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently mentioned that we were too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure instead of being so relaxed. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that way, being a parent never really ends.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. At 30, I had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, and it is. However, it also makes you just one of many parents. This can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one smile from her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful and can melt anyone's heart."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964 and based on the Boeing 707. However, the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were about to experience something extraordinary. Inside, the plane resembled a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous young scientists sat, feeling anxious. 

For a year, they had competed with other students to earn a spot on this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. The challenge was to propose creative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas were chosen for this unique flight, which felt like the most thrilling roller-coaster ride imaginable. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, soaring upwards before diving back down. The goal was to create a moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft would rise higher due to its own speed before gravity pulled it back down. In those brief moments between rising and falling, everything inside the plane, including the students, would become weightless, making them feel closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were thrown around the cabin. Then, the engines stopped, and we instantly experienced weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One small step sent us soaring towards the ceiling. We drifted without direction; up and down lost their meaning. Only gravity helps us understand where we are.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, causing some students to land hard. After completing the first curve, some felt queasy at the thought of the 29 more to come. Thirty curves provided ten minutes of ""space time"" for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to learn how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to investigate this, and one student managed to flip it over using a remote control. 

However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on the device, nearly damaging it. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints are affected by weightlessness, which could help in building future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet light. They hoped that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unsteady, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This exhilarating experience would stay with them for a long time. ""It was unforgettable,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine consecutive winters. I enjoyed this because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my siblings and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then it can be yours.” The goal was for us to always have a connection to New Zealand, which is special because my father grew up there. They found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.

I have always been passionate about land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I think my family became enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those very rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember that time as happy since I was often wet and cold. Each morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting while coming out of the Land Rover, which was warm and dry, into the pouring rain. My anorak was still damp from the day before, my boots were soaked, and my hands struggled with slippery laces. “The brain starts to take over, allowing for many strange thoughts and reflections about life.”

In that first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. I wore a planting bag around my neck, filling it with as many trees as I could. When the bag was full, it was heavy, and only when it became lighter did the work get easier. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line. These poles guide your planting. Once you are aligned, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, planting trees became almost automatic. You develop a rhythm and use the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many agricultural jobs; you train your body to perform a series of standard moves, making the work much easier. You create a regular process: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it was fascinating. My mind began to wander, allowing many thoughts and reflections about life to emerge. A lot of my ideas about nature and our place in it started during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and have watched the trees grow, which is very satisfying since I planted them and feel a connection to their success. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such headlines make me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand in 1984 for three months, completely alone. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area remains very strong. In many ways, it is the place I feel most connected to, representing the bond between people and the earth—a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. However, the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. Curious, I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they often starve and are never found. These three were brought to me by construction workers who accidentally disturbed their home while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still suckling her. Although the cubs were healthy, they were cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic their mother’s licking, which helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, though unsteadily. They were happy with each other’s company and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet’s examination showed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it’s important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow’s case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other cubs. Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about my cubs, came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she wouldn’t return because the area had been disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females, and I soon learned why his mother had left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle’s teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly chewed and eventually ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. By five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.

By August, my badgers had started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the tall grass made it easy for them to chase each other. They would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase their tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with colorful bruises. During two late-night walks in a dry spell, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely searching for food, as badgers are territorial and will fight off others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a campaign to build a sett for the badgers on our farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for them. Our son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and bedding than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline sponsored part of the project, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to help the badgers have a home.

One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle down. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Nowadays, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally, as she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before they dash off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, during his time, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" using calculations from his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding this was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately across the oceans.

Halley, one of only two men in England paid to do scientific research at that time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but he later sailed again. This journey took him to Rio de Janeiro, past South Georgia, up to Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a chart in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. More advanced charts based on his work helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.

Dr. Clark plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting his efforts. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while spending two years at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not only an astronomer but also researched geophysics. While serving as Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and pursued other interests.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his work, *Principia Mathematica*, which is fundamental to classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His planned expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with much more accurate instruments. These measurements are necessary because the Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data collected will help improve the current mathematical model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is common to measure the strength but not the direction of the magnetic field,"" Dr. Clark explains. ""You need to know true north to measure the direction. On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground-based measurements will be useful for comparison.

Halley's Atlantic journey was significant as it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he became the first civilian naval captain to pursue what many considered an obsession with declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to make his journey successful? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to dedicate eight months to this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the often critical hens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could such extravagant features evolve in a competitive natural world? How do these birds manage to survive with such large tails?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, a century after Darwin's death, to find answers. Darwin believed that living beings evolved through natural selection, where the strongest and most suited individuals survive and reproduce. However, he thought that the peacock's tail was a burden, leading him to propose a different idea called ""sexual selection."" He suggested that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be some hidden quality that made those males more fit for survival. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it indicated something important about the male's fitness.

Today, researchers still debate these ideas. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging, but the 200 birds at Whipsnade, which live in a semi-wild environment and are accustomed to humans, provide a unique opportunity for research. Petrie and her team are investigating two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most extravagant tails? And do these males possess any additional qualities that make them more fit, as Wallace suggested, or is it just about appearance, as Darwin believed?

Observations show that the hens do seem to prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be less likely to have parasites, and their bright feathers could signal their health. There is some evidence for this in other bird species, but Petrie and her team have not yet been able to study the internal health of the peacocks at Whipsnade.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive ones. Are the young of the attractive males healthier and growing faster? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is based on practical benefits.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician and biologist R A Fisher, known as ""Fisher's Runaway."" He suggested that if a female prefers a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that trait, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to males with increasingly long tails, reinforcing the idea that females are selecting for beauty.

In conclusion, this ongoing research may ultimately support both Darwin's and Wallace's theories, showing that female choice can be both about beauty and practical advantages."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix traditional and modern elements. He applied this idea to his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many beautiful yachts filled with new technology. Most of these boats are descendants of a major design change that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. Perhaps I am, but I’m not sure.

My boat benefits from the charm of classic design, but modern technology has made the process easier. However, it is important to note that advanced technology often separates sailors from the true challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not suggesting that sailors should face every hardship. I believe it is essential for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor.

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change creates a cabin that resembles a cruise ship, with a bed larger than one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that it had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over time, I learned how wise he was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I have ever sailed.

However, classic boats require a lot of maintenance due to their age. After injuring my back, I realized I could no longer care for Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but found none that met my needs, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design programs, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before moving to the computer. After creating a model, just like boatyards did in the past, we refined the design using technology. The final version was perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, moves beautifully at sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. This may be because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture. This traditional approach works well. In her calm presence, she proves that you don’t need to follow trends to find happiness and that sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with wood treated to resist water, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat while looking, feeling, and sailing like a true classic."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to unwind. My room in the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I did nothing but sleep. Starting on the second day, I joined body conditioning classes and tried as many activities as I could, like yoga and stretching. The instructors are very skilled. As the week went on, I felt more flexible. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy (which made me feel incredibly relaxed), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, lasting an hour, truly makes you feel rejuvenated. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly, kind, and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer a quieter time and the weather is nice, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and my appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and energetic, which lasted a long time. I will definitely return. This is the ideal getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!  
*Marcella D'Argy Smith*

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this grand home was clear as soon as I walked up the large staircase into the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can avoid talking to others if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, including an examination of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt a bit strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder issue found during the check-up was quickly addressed by the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.  
*Liz Gregory*

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not claim to be one. It is a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef prepares rich sauces and delightful creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, so I could work off some of the tempting dishes. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic. I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.  
*Beverly D'Silva*

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and much more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-rated restaurant, serves dishes that are absolutely delightful. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many options. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym using exercise equipment to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other journalists who would write about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments. Cliveden offers all these if you want to use them before treating yourself at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a setback if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best night's sleep in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse group, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor, we have not developed significant differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This suggests that the traits that make us human are a recent development in our evolutionary history. Our ability to create art and other unique human characteristics likely come from just a small number of our genes. This is a heavy responsibility for such a limited set of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree rather than kind. For instance, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools; chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a basic form of language, using different sounds to warn of predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. This means that aside from art, there are few clear differences between humans and animals.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. We only have clear evidence of human art, such as cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments, starting around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we argue that our recent artistic explosion makes us different, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three common claims are made: human art is non-utilitarian, it is created for aesthetic pleasure, and it is learned rather than instinctive. 

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, like defending territory or attracting mates, which helps transmit their genes. By this measure, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily distinguishable, but these styles are not genetically inherited. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' specific songs, even if they have never heard them before. 

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly our styles change. Roman writers noted that geese honked the same way 2,000 years ago, while human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum visitors can tell that a twentieth-century painting is newer than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify the time and artist of a painting they do not know. However, even experts might confuse two mid-twentieth-century chimpanzee artists named Congo and Betsy with lesser-known human abstract expressionists. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment, and reacted strongly when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a joint exhibition in 1957 in London, and many of their paintings sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These chimpanzee paintings challenge the distinctions between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the paintings by these apes did not serve practical purposes; they were created for the satisfaction of the artists. One might argue that human art is different because it is often intended as a form of communication, while the apes did not care to share their work with others. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human artworks were also created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth and also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. In the past, children's stories featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting at distant horizons on their journeys into the unknown. Nowadays, such characters are rare in fiction and even rarer in real life. That was my belief until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, known locally as the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey from the comfort of his family home. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the harshest deserts in the world, and Charles Blackmore wrote a captivating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t return since no one had ever completed that route; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly kind to us.""

Anyone reading his remarkable account will be surprised by the word ""kind."" The team faced terrible hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and the loss of part of their precious water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn’t experience the Taklamakan’s famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have completely stopped us. That doesn’t mean we weren’t constantly battling challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What motivated me most was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very afraid of my physical ability to complete it. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to start now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the struggle it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert doesn’t compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the determination of it all. We were uplifted by our sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,"**Text: Life Without Gadgets**

Susan Harr decides to unplug her devices and enjoy manual work. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. However, this reliance on technology has led us to believe that it is essential. Using our hands does not harm the environment, unlike many gadgets. 

Recently, Susan had a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix. This made her question whether gadgets are really worth the trouble. She started to let her household technology break down naturally, wondering what ""extra time"" technology actually gives us. Does it just allow us to buy more gadgets for new activities? 

When her word processor started making strange noises, even after being unplugged, she decided to leave it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys working without a noisy machine, taking her time with her projects. Although she appreciates some gadgets, like her washing machine, she has found joy in living without others. 

For example, she returned her rented color television and switched to a small black-and-white one. This change has encouraged her family to spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. Susan has taken up sewing by hand, as her old sewing machine is now just a table for plants. 

People often think they cannot live without technology, but Susan believes that life can be better without it. She appreciates the time spent sewing, which allows her to listen to the radio or talk with family. She can even watch her favorite shows while doing something productive, easing her guilt about watching TV. 

Sewing by hand has a calming effect, and she finds satisfaction in seeing her work improve. This slower pace of life helps her avoid the rush that often comes with modern living. She enjoys simple tasks like washing dishes, where she can daydream and relax. 

Now, Susan looks around her home and questions the need for many gadgets. Do they really need a freezer, a microwave, or an electric lawnmower? She realizes they could save a lot of money by living without electric lights too!"
CAE_62,"**Text: The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst**

Charles Hurst is a skilled cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It’s hard to tell if he is genuinely busy or just trying to hide his shyness. Looking around, I see that he is indeed very busy, with many unfinished pieces of furniture and wooden planks in various natural colors.

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a strong reputation. His order book is always full for months ahead, even though he does not actively promote himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right choice. While it is not difficult to find a furniture-maker, it is harder to find one who focuses on creating well-crafted furniture with clean, simple designs. Hurst notes, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers.""

As a craftsman with high standards, Hurst often feels disappointed by modern furniture. He expresses his frustration with poorly made, mass-produced items and craftsmen who produce low-quality work. His pursuit of perfection is a key reason for his success, along with his talent. Hurst is confident in his skills, stating, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" Although he shows some modesty at the end of our conversation, his confidence is clear.

Hurst is self-taught. When asked how he learned his craft, he replies, ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up."" Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return for more projects. He enjoys the satisfaction of working on an entire house for a client. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. ""The most frustrating clients are those who don’t know what they want and change their minds too late. My favorite clients are the exacting ones.""

While Hurst has every reason to be proud, he also acknowledges the skills of others. He humbly states, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He criticizes craftsmen who try to be artists and take too long to create a single piece. He also finds degree shows, where students showcase their work while trying to make fashion statements, to be pretentious. ""A piece of furniture should be practical, not just a statement.""

Despite his confidence and straightforward manner, Hurst is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."" This statement reflects his grounded approach to his craft and a touch of humility."
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and to help us recover so we can function well.

The second theory focuses on the benefits of sleep for learning. It argues that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It claims that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we have enough for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own quirks and peculiarities. For example, someone might enjoy entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the editor about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality.

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism represents our desire to be unique, while conformity represents our need to fit in. For many, the desire to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as strange. The key idea here is 'common.' They seek out others who understand their oddities, creating a sense of comfort in numbers. 

Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be ourselves. Even when we follow the crowd, we may feel defensive about it. For instance, someone might assert their individuality by saying, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as I am."" 

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, the American singer, once said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it with determination, you will surprise many people."" However, this assertion of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, they are not being eccentric. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they may be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are.

True eccentrics are not focused on what others think. They act according to their true selves. This sets them apart from enthusiasts, pranksters, clever criminals, attention-seekers, and recluses, who are all aware of society. Eccentrics, on the other hand, live their lives freely, regardless of societal expectations."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the opportunity to meet many important figures in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been central to environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. When I was a young journalist, her insights helped me understand the complexities of the field. Choosing her book was more challenging. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*, but I believe *The Home of Man* is her most significant work. It discusses the rapid growth of cities while addressing the larger themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now refer to as ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book beautifully explains the fascinating world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos to a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a distinguished behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and appealing to anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a fulfilling career in conservation, but it also deepened my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Many believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, viewing all living beings as a family, intertwined and inseparable. This is an important idea for us all to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I discovered *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images captivated me. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which inspired me to start sketching them. However, *The Shell Bird Book* offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative responses to nature are just as valid as scientific ones. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new possibilities for myself."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?** 

We asked five major British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here’s what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers; they are the first thing we read in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more accepting of bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views on a book since they often read it first.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews today are more varied and accessible than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which most people read. Weekly summaries of books are often not enough, and original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a trusted source can significantly boost sales, especially if there are multiple positive reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, and we rarely advertise, so we rely on literary editors to review our books. Positive reviews are much more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be supported by other factors like recommendations from readers, strong responses from booksellers, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., it’s straightforward: a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, booksellers often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for a good writer to gain readers. Interestingly, some poorly received books or those without reviews can still sell very well. The situation is unpredictable, although non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they actually lead to sales? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn’t sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer’s name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, people paid attention. Today, it can be just as effective if an unexpected reviewer or a particularly clever review catches the reader's interest."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith, one of the few artisans in the country who creates hand-cut weathervanes. Graham designs each piece to meet the specific needs of his customers. ""This way, I can create a unique, personalized item,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for special gifts for their husbands, wanting something that reflects their interests in work or leisure.

Graham's work is quite different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made featured a witch on a broomstick, which surprised his wife. Friends admired it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that the subjects for weathervanes are endless,"" he explains. 

Graham decided to focus on his weathervane business after working for 15 years as a precision engineer. Five years ago, he and his wife, Liz, switched roles: she became the main breadwinner while he took care of their children and developed his business. He has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job lacked creativity, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy the design process.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays great attention to detail and always seeks customer approval for the design before he starts cutting. He also keeps many traditional designs available, as they are still very popular. ""People are drawn to handmade items,"" Graham notes. ""They appreciate the chance to own something unique.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to maintain its rural character. ""I have found my niche in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I feel satisfied when a simple shape transforms into something almost lifelike,"" he explains. 

For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand changes in the weather by indicating shifts in wind direction. Nowadays, as more people move to rural areas, they want to add special touches to their homes, which has benefited crafts like Graham's. He has become busier, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

The beginning of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who worked as a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. Things started badly when a film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart almost overnight. He felt disappointed and worried because he hadn’t earned any money in two years, and the film was his only hope to calm his angry bank manager.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to being a television executive or started a television project that was on hold. Instead, he made a decision that many, including himself, thought was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel.

Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. It was inspired by a farrier he met while visiting a friend in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive for no reason. Its owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were known as ""horse whisperers."" This story captured Evans' imagination.

He initially wanted to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after losing hope in the film industry, he decided to write the story as a book. Throughout the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt very alone and thought my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about how to support my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from the bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for more feedback, he suggested that Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more months of work ahead.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with a twelve-page summary of the rest, to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""You what?"" Evans replied, surprised. The agent felt something big was about to happen.

What followed became a significant moment in publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we just sat there in shock. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don’t know how it got there,"" Evans said. They also didn’t send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for the film rights. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent in the US, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

As they agreed on this amount, the studios each presented their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called one after another, eager to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me over coffee on his wooden porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It has all felt like a fairy tale so far. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don’t want to become just another employee of these people I like who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then hear, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll bring in someone else now.'""

He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to pursue it. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he concluded."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become increasingly a game for younger players. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game impressively, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

The game of chess has changed significantly in the last two decades. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Today, winning is the main goal for chess players. In international chess, a player’s mental strength and endurance are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high, with a chess clock ensuring players make their moves in a set time. If they fail, they lose immediately. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also evolved. Much preparation now happens off the board, including psychological strategies. Players must prepare thoroughly before matches, especially with the rise of computer databases that can store millions of chess games. These tools allow players to analyze their opponents’ past games and find weaknesses. 

Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes worldwide. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must maintain focus throughout. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, often leading to frantic moments where players must make quick moves or risk losing. 

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and relief from stress. However, one victory is not enough to win a tournament. Chess competitions usually last 9 to 11 days, with games played every day, and tournaments occur year-round. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in 1984 had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing about 10 kg.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game puzzling. However, it also adds to his legacy. If he has returned for financial reasons, he is likely to succeed, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Remarkably, before writing *Peaches*, Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I understand the challenges involved. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my work to be performed, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he shares. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made significant progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just completed a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even during his time at Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful.""

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, gained public attention as the lead in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he smiles. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was destined for recognition. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was using acting as an excuse to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a hit, but for me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel discouraged. Just when I was about to give up, I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I had been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry community, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I got bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a bold step. ""My poetry has a structure, so there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, which means there are more opportunities to write poorly. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I produce work without caring about its quality."""
CAE_1,"A. Isabel, our main character in this quirky novel, believes she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she wants to avoid the wrong crowd. At 31, she is an art student who loves historical romances and is searching for Mr. Right, worried that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, her hope keeps her going, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It offers a humorous perspective on radio, seen through the eyes of a clever but timid child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon features a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to showcase his dry humor and subtle writing style, taking readers back to the simpler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores, old cars, and, of course, radio.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex. The poet writes poor poetry, which bothers Richard, and she seeks his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. Yet, the most interesting part is how the author unravels these issues. He moves the story forward with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a delightful and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become intertwined in life and death for the next twenty-five years. At the beginning of this lengthy novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, edited by his friend Richard Blake. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that they both loved a woman who was killed years earlier. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to deeply connect with the characters.

E. Written by one of the best American authors, this funny and heartfelt story follows Ian Bedloe, who, feeling guilty about a past mistake, takes on the role of 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor while managing household responsibilities. The story explores deep emotions and highlights the touching bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a lovely, warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work significantly helps development. While volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than one volunteer could provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack the necessary skills or experience. Many studies raise the question of whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a genuine desire to help or if young people are more interested in gaining experiences that will benefit their careers. However, these projects may help develop individuals who will act ethically in support of those in need throughout their lives.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and increased participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also create international social networks among ordinary people. In this case, the overall benefits for both volunteers and host communities can be greater than the individual contributions. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those who lack access to such opportunities. Volunteers may continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities to advance their own goals.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity from wealthy Westerners. At its best, it can provide benefits and challenges for volunteers and the organizations they work with, while allowing for the exchange of skills and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing issues of inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of personal strategies to help others. These limited strategies, focused on making a small difference, can seem positive in a climate that is often anti-political. The personal aspect appears appealing as it avoids large government and business involvement. However, it also overlooks the need for democratic governance and reduces development to individual acts of charity, which often do not address the root problems faced by poor rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is unwarranted, when volunteer tourism is promoted as sustainable development, it can dilute the true meaning of development. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them get out of bed. This is why clock radios are popular. But how do you choose a good one? A panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

One model has a 'dual alarm function,' which I initially thought would let you wake up to a buzzer, snooze for a bit, and then get up. However, the instruction booklet suggests using this feature to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and another for weekends. But who really schedules their life like that? This model costs about the same as another we tested, and it includes a cassette player, which is a nice bonus—you can listen to your favorite tapes as you fall asleep and wake up to a peaceful morning. We all agreed the radio quality was excellent, but the size was an issue; it was as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best in terms of appearance and overall performance. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I found the digital display appealing, with its stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze button is easy to tap even with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons, which felt nice to touch, distracted me and made me want to play with them, leading to confusion when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don’t have to reset it if someone accidentally unplugs it. Everyone liked this feature, but we all found it tricky to set up. Still, once we figured it out, we felt quite sophisticated.

Tom Granger criticized another model with a built-in lamp, calling it 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to struggle to get the light to work and read the instructions twice before he could set it up. The light was difficult to position and was not bright enough to read by, only shining on the clock, which was already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp amusing but agreed that tuning the radio was challenging. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, making me want to throw the whole thing across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, it has a bright design that appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out more than the others. In fact, its traditional controls were the only ones we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual states, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time.' Paul Bridges laughed at this idea, calling the model 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model we tested was appreciated by Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space,' and it had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said it was easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you can never be sure if you pressed the buttons correctly, which makes it hard to trust that it will work. However, he acknowledged that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of the new button-tuning technology. I found the tuning a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for its sharp spines that cover its body. They are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward for protection. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, making them more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using that ability only as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in burrows. While all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; some may stay awake throughout the year if conditions are suitable."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their dreams.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's an amazing feeling to soar through the air and land safely, but it can be frightening. Sometimes I feel unwell or face bad weather, but I push through. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up much of my social life and time with friends, but I chose this path. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete on the same courses and receive equal treatment—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours daily on the bike, along with stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment required.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because few schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, making it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to instability in the women's team. Despite these challenges, I enjoy rowing and staying fit, and I appreciate the social aspect of the sport.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how vast it is! I found Britain too confining and safe. I was very determined and disliked being controlled. Each walk has been unique. My walk across Australia was the most painful experience, covering 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! I had to succeed because my sponsorship would end after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, making them hesitant to sponsor us.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, which is evident on the roads. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges; men often feel they must beat me, leading to many tough moments. You need to be competitive and assertive. It's hard to earn money in this sport, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It's encouraging to see more women joining the sport each year. For me, the thrill of saloon car racing lies in striving for perfection and achieving the perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 AM three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before races, and I really push myself during competitions. I often wonder why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn't force myself to train, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also less for women. However, we have established an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he recognized Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of my time drawing and had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person, usually working in the hills. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have approached him if my friend hadn’t encouraged me. Nervously, I introduced myself and asked for his signature, and to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of my sketchbook and then added a lively drawing below it. His art often reflected real things, so the lines he drew might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was even worse, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. Still, I managed to tell Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But he noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and urged me to go back and talk to him again. 

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided not to ask if I could draw his portrait, fearing he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, set up my pad, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled mischievously and made it hard for me to draw by making funny faces and gestures. Despite his antics, I felt he was testing my determination. Eventually, he settled down and allowed me to study him closely.

I noticed how strong and alert he looked, dressed in a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were full of life. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he appeared to be in his own world, quietly focused on his thoughts. When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt shy and thought it wasn’t good enough. But he insisted, and when I showed it to him, he nodded approvingly.

Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he sketched a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had humorously placed one of my eyes on my nose and captured my smile with a single lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks. 

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he had limits to his generosity! Still, I feel incredibly lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This article explains the strategies that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**  
Supermarkets understand that customers value fresh food. To create this impression, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that fills the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind people of fresh produce. However, most items sold in supermarkets, like frozen foods and cleaning products, do not fit this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**  
The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use technology to find out which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit items in these spots, while also using eye-level shelves to catch attention. Special offer bins are placed strategically to attract bargain hunters. Additionally, they often place related items together, like desserts near ice cream, to encourage more purchases.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers must walk past more expensive items, which may tempt them to buy. Chain stores also position their popular products away from the entrance, hoping loyal customers will search for them and encounter other tempting items along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**  
In recent years, chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from a crowded display style to a more boutique-like approach, showcasing limited fashion items. This gives the impression of exclusivity, even though their clothing is still mass-produced. Their success is due to both good store design and appealing clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**  
Shoppers often focus more on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items to attract customers. They may even sell some staples at a loss to draw people in, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They achieve low prices by buying in bulk and negotiating discounts with manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**  
Customers tend to buy fewer items in chain stores and pay more attention to individual prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider their lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, helping customers see the true colors of clothing. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to highlight fresh produce.

**H. Walk This Way**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers through the store. These paths, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" encourage customers to explore. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use more inviting carpets in sales areas to encourage shoppers to venture off the main paths.

**I. In-Store Promotion**  
As you enter a supermarket, you are often greeted by large, colorful images of delicious food, which can be hard to resist if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that display advertisements as you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and claim to increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, aged 58, is famous for reaching the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written several books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail solo around the world in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sailing trip. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first experience on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 

Eventually, we reached a steep drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before, and he said he hadn’t, so I showed him how. After I finished, Robin politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit uneasy, but he managed to lower himself safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion that we combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural progression from our Skye adventure.

I was very impressed by Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin always consulted the crew first. Most of the time, no one dared to give him advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. Honestly, I found sailing quite challenging and boring. The moments of crisis were easier to handle because they brought excitement. However, I struggled with spending day after day in the middle of the ocean. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin is a natural sailor who enjoys fixing the engine or repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless.

The crew was also cramped, with six people on a 32-foot yacht designed for four. On a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other, but that wasn’t possible on the boat. When we arrived in Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many moments while climbing when if Robin had fallen, he could have taken me down with him. I had to be very careful. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 

The first time we tried to reach the top, we were active for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges, but he completely trusted me and followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted my decision. I also knew that Robin was concerned about the boat: whether it could get through the ice and if it was still intact. Yet, he was eager for us to try climbing the mountain again.

The only time our relationship almost faced a crisis was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns keeping watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had nearly fallen asleep. I felt he didn’t trust me, which made me insecure, and I expressed my feelings. Robin quickly reassured me that I had misunderstood the situation. While we enjoyed our trip to Skye, we truly got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin is a kind-hearted and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life since ancient times, appearing in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, people left apple remains near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, ancient humans even stored dried apple halves for winter. These early apples were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, quite different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. One dessert apple, called Decio, was thought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in Britain, and soon Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple types, which are the ancestors of most Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
During the thirteenth century, several apple varieties became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, giving rise to the term 'costermonger,' meaning a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This trend continued until the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so beloved in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them precious. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the well-known apple planter was John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed.' Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans viewed him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious beliefs led to many folktales about him, including stories of him sleeping with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa discovered a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named this apple 'Hawkey.' After presenting it at a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples globally.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. She was known as 'Granny Smith' because she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she discovered a small tree growing among discarded fruit. She transplanted it, and soon she was harvesting the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she remarked, ""Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the fruit and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from northern India to luxury orchards in Africa. However, most apples are commercially produced and come from only a few varieties, often chosen for their appearance or ability to travel rather than their taste. This trend of uniformity is dulling our taste and reducing genetic diversity. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are beginning to seek more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to preserve diversity in apples or any food. We must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

Our river journeys in India, Africa, and the Amazon provide a unique view of beautiful landscapes and wildlife."
CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner and one of Britain's best in the 10,000 meters, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a sunny mountain path leads from a quiet road in Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. This beautiful but remote place, called Nanyuk, has been my base for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands for the past three years. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners until my fourth winter trip to Kenya. This time, I decided to change that tradition. I participated in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I received an invitation from the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss.

Training at high altitude increases the number of red blood cells, which helps carry more oxygen. This has been proven by the success of many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa, which took place before my time at the training camp, was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, and all but three were Kenyan. I felt I had run well, but I believe Kenyan success is not only due to the altitude. Kenyan runners are known for their simple approach to the sport. Their running style looks effortless, their diet is straightforward, and they seem to enjoy competing.

One important aspect of Kenyan success is their training. My time at the national team camp revealed their methods. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The facilities are basic, with athletes living in shared dormitories with regular students. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training in the late morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. Each day starts at six in the morning, and we gather for a briefing from the coaches. They remind us to take it easy in the morning because a tough workout awaits. We run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when we only run 20 kilometers, which is a welcome break.

Life at the camp is simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth is enough for morning preparations. Breakfast consists of tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner are similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to one of the streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers to bathe. By the end of my stay, I gained a deeper appreciation for Kenyan success. It cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simplicity of life in the mountains, the hard training, and the passion for success might be the true reasons behind Kenya's dominance in long-distance running."
CAE_7,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This issue is not just due to the recession; advertising began to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are deeper and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not adapted to the fast changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large markets and broad media, but as brands and media options have increased, target audiences have become more diverse. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not. This is a major reason why advertising is not working well.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to purchase more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen brands a year. If you buy a new car, it is likely provided by your employer, and if not, you may only buy one every three years. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even when you consider all the other products and services, it is likely that you do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In contrast, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are individually listed and analyzed. The average consumer buys only 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all of these purchases are influenced by advertising. This means that only about 4 percent of the advertised brands are actually bought. 

You might think you are different and not influenced by advertising, but most people feel the same way. The reality is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always waste in advertising because not every person who sees an ad will buy the product. It is unrealistic to think that every reader or viewer will rush out to buy all the advertised brands. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many ads have shown that it can work. 

Advertising needs to reach a large audience to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as advertisers cannot predict who will be interested. Media advertising is a cost-effective way to communicate with many people, even if it seems expensive. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who are likely to respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns do not achieve a 100 percent response rate. This is a key difference between media advertising and personal selling. A salesperson might succeed with every potential client they meet, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would communicate with them directly.

Any advertiser who can attract one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is considered successful. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled to gain a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can reach more than 2 percent of the population is very successful, and this is just a small part of the overall market. While mass media can be an effective way to reach these customers, advertising needs to be more focused than ever to succeed again."
CAE_43,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Explores Britain's Most Eco-Friendly Home**

Charles Clover visits a unique home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, known for its environmental friendliness. Southwell is home to the lesser-known Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral admired for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen in the thirteenth century. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' created by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is considered the greenest home in Britain.

The Vales have designed their home to be self-sufficient. They collect rainwater for drinking and washing, recycle sewage into compost for their garden, and use waste heat from their appliances and their own bodies to warm the house. Their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday, also contribute to the warmth. The house, which looks traditional with its clay tile roof, is located 300 yards from the Minster and blends in with the town's historic buildings. It was approved by planners even though it is in a conservation area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice complete silence. The house is extremely well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Inside, after removing your shoes as Robert requests, you will find a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates throughout the house. Robert opens clever ventilation systems to create airflow, as the house is designed to be airtight. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to environmental issues since the 1970s when they wrote a book called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to eliminate the need for mains water. They installed composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher to avoid harsh detergents.

Robert explains that they want to show that it is possible to design a house that is much less harmful to the environment while still being comfortable and modern. The only medieval feature is the design of the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, extending to the top of the house. The Vales do not pay for water, and last winter, their electricity usage was only nine units a day, costing about 70p—much less than typical four-bedroom homes.

Soon, they will install solar panels worth £20,000 in the garden, which will allow the house to generate more electricity than it uses. They will still rely on mains electricity for cooking and appliances but expect to have enough surplus energy to eventually charge an electric car. The only source of heat is a small wood-burning stove, which they rarely use except during the coldest days.

When asked if the house stays warm in winter, Robert shared that during a visit in February, it was too warm to light the stove. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than usual for living spaces, but he found it comfortable due to the lack of drafts and consistent temperatures throughout the house. He notes that people in the past were comfortable at lower temperatures because of their clothing. He suggests that those living in older homes might consider returning to simpler living, though this idea may not be popular.

The success of the house lies in its low-tech design, which minimizes potential problems. Most materials were sourced from local suppliers and installed by local craftsmen, making it affordable to build—comparable in cost to low-income rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial builders are resistant to this innovative approach."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The Camera Never Lies

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a rational and scientific person. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article, accepting fairies as supernatural beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The images are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges a key idea about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and always has been able to. Nowadays, we often use computer software to edit our digital images, and it is a misconception that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths, who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths held a respected position, similar to doctors and astrologers, because they were the only ones who made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture were crafted by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased. Heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used the beautiful wrought iron handrails that blacksmiths made. In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more open-minded approach to interior design. Still, much of the work produced seems repetitive, with manufacturers labeling their gates and balconies as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can hardly enter a trendy design store without seeing rusty candlesticks with unnecessary decorations.

Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote their craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be entering a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are becoming more aware of the craft. Modern power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to shape metal without the hard labor of working over a hot anvil. Dawson explains, ""These artists now have a material that allows them to express themselves.""

About 250 pieces have been created for the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual artists, but a portion of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote quality ironwork. Dawson's contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a hand-blown glass shade. He describes his style as allowing steel to bend and flow into shape when it is hot, comparing it to drawing with metal in space.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, says, ""It's quite magical because it's incredibly soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes rigid and unmovable again."" Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, and another resembles a Celtic cross. She loves the cold, hard feel of steel and how it seems to last forever.

No other metal has provided as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for the next thousand years, as long as we can avoid seeing any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**

I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying, even for me. 

The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I hadn’t planned to quit, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family, and I didn’t feel sick or cough often. In fact, I seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session in Birmingham called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I clearly stated, ""I won’t be trying to stop; I’m here to write, not to quit, so it wouldn’t be fair to expect your method to work on me."" I was very reasonable because I genuinely enjoyed smoking; it brought me real pleasure. 

The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about quitting started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker started to make me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that didn’t involve anyone else. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, faded after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it turned out to be fine. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was just relaxing at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I am starting to realize that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—like eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have previously smoked."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been testing my friends to see if they know about her. When I tell them I am writing her biography, I watch their reactions. If they seem excited and say things like, ""Surely there’s already a biography!"" they pass the test.

Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, which should make her famous. If someone in literature had the same achievement, they would be well-known. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person, as complex as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects significant changes in the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin suggested I look for a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of hers and shared her commitment to peace. I went to the main bookstore in my university town, but I found no biographies of Pauling. I was surprised that he was not considered interesting enough for British readers, even though he was a highly influential chemist and a Nobel Prize winner in both chemistry and peace.

Even scientists sometimes think that biographies about scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, a Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers do too. This idea that scientists are different from other people is part of the ""two cultures"" mentality, which suggests a divide between the arts and sciences. Only a few famous scientists make it into the biography sections of bookstores.

It is not true that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. For example, a leading geneticist told me he would only be interviewed if he was not quoted or photographed, as he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This reluctance to share personal stories can create a false impression of science and may discourage young people from pursuing scientific careers.

Fortunately, things are changing. Nowadays, scientists often appear in public in ways other than just scientific interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help make scientists more relatable to the public.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and dull, often ignoring the personal lives of scientists. However, this has changed with books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been portrayed with their flaws, making them more human.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. She made significant discoveries, including the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and insulin in 1969. She achieved these successes by pushing scientific techniques to new levels. However, she also raised three children and had a husband who was often away due to his job as a historian. While her personal life may not seem directly related to her work, it shows how she balanced different aspects of her life.

There is much in Hodgkin's life that is interesting to everyone, but her scientific achievements are also important. Scientific inquiry was her passion, which is essential for any successful scientist. The challenge for biographers is to communicate this passion effectively. Many readers may not have the scientific background to understand complex ideas without detailed explanations. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that educated people who would feel embarrassed for not knowing a famous literary figure often remain unaware of the significant contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for her unique ability to find water. She uses a forked hazel stick to detect underground water sources. Farmers whose wells have dried up often seek her help. Along with her husband, she runs a well-drilling business that uses modern equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, when it comes to finding water, she relies solely on her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This skill, known as dowsing, allows people to locate water, minerals, and lost items underground. There are various theories about how dowsing works, ranging from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One popular theory suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, with water vibrating more than other materials. Some dowsers claim they can sense these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years of drought, Margaret has been very busy, sometimes having a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns, where installing long water pipes is too expensive, and developers of golf courses who need water for their facilities.

Margaret typically looks for water at depths of 50 to 70 meters. She emphasizes the importance of avoiding areas where waste could contaminate the water supply. The water she finds is usually in cracks of solid rock, and as long as it is brought up directly, it should be clean. However, she notes that Cornwall has many minerals, so they must be cautious about iron in the water. 

Electricity is also necessary to operate the pump, but running power lines across long distances can be costly. Therefore, it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. Once these factors are considered, Margaret begins her search for water.

For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. It will swing when she is above a water source. After identifying potential areas on the map, she walks the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. 

""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation and sway slightly. Once that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact drilling spot,"" she explains. By holding the two forks of the stick and applying slight tension, she can tell if water is directly below. ""If the straight part of the stick rises, it means water is there. It’s crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret and her husband often dowse the same area. Usually, they agree on where to drill, but if they disagree, they will keep searching until they find a consensus.

Margaret's skills are not just a local tradition; they have intrigued anthropologists and writers for a long time. She describes her ability as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this special skill, it would be difficult for her family to sustain their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be exciting to try something completely different. We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, 23, is a young mother with two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, 30, who works as a waitress in a fancy London restaurant. 

Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and crowded, which was very different from her hometown. She felt nervous and overwhelmed. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when Amanda tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and reassured her that everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line of customers was waiting outside, and Amanda felt anxious about remembering their orders. Luckily, the ordering system was automated, which made things easier. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she struggled to hear customers over the loud music. She often had to ask them to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and just wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, which surprised Amanda. She realized waitressing was much harder than she thought. She used to think it was an easy job, but it actually requires a lot of energy and a friendly attitude, especially during busy times. Amanda felt relieved to return to her children, as being a mom seemed much easier after her day as a waitress.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy, who is 30, was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She had heard that Amanda's daughters could be mischievous, but she thought she could manage. 

After Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have three hours of peace. But she was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded her that she still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry. 

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. The real chaos began when she brought Sophie home from school. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and played a loud game. Cindy tried to stay calm, thinking they would tire out soon, but they had more energy than she expected! After much effort, she finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun continued. The girls kept asking for glasses of water, which was just a trick to get them downstairs to watch TV. Cindy spent the whole evening negotiating with them, and she realized how tiring it is to take care of two small children. There was no time for herself, and the responsibility felt overwhelming. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, 30, a primary school teacher. 

On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt like a treat! She was unsure how to dress for school and hoped she wouldn’t stand out. At assembly, she faced about 400 students and hoped to blend in. 

In math class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from her own school experience. She helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There was so much to do before the next classes. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which she enjoyed, followed by a French lesson where the children practiced on her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, she was exhausted, while the children seemed full of energy. Speaking in front of the class was the hardest part for her. Although teachers have more holidays, Rosemary decided she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! Rosemary's farm is large, with many cows and sheep. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell.

Hilary spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling containers with milk and making ice cream. It was hard not to taste the treats! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are not checked daily, they can die, which is especially tough in winter. After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! 

Hilary found the day lonely and missed being around children, as animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of farming is that there is no time off; the cows need to be milked twice a day, making it hard to plan vacations. Rosemary only gets about three days off this year. Farming may seem romantic, but the reality is very different, with an unpredictable income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is surprising how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces. When you meet him, he looks youthful and has a bright personality, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a television feature was made about his work, filmed in both London and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo and began his musical journey with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but enjoyed Louis Armstrong, decided to buy him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother arranged for him to take lessons from the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who recognized his natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, someone who was passionate about the trumpet and always looking for ways to improve.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to create a perfect one. There will always be some flaws, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them. From the start, he had a unique sound that was recognizable, which he considers his first achievement. Unlike John Wallace, a prominent British trumpet player who came from a brass band background, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.

At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson suggested America, it was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud discouraged him from joining an orchestra, saying that playing in one was like ""digging in the garden."" Hardenberger knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience. Thibaud had encouraged him to enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but advanced to the second. He was familiar with most pieces in that round, but in the final, he faced a concerto that intimidated him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even if he felt he played poorly, people were still listening.

Hardenberger's honest view of his talent might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what makes his communication with the audience special, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. He feels that the true power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**New In Paperback**

A. The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insights, making it a challenging but rewarding read.

B. Harriet is a composed, middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe physically recovers but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him consumes her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

C. This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, vividly imagined through the daydreams of the young character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He suddenly disappears from the story but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

D. After his recent success, the author has written a sequel filled with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's outlook on life remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie supports her in her enjoyable manipulation of friends and suitors. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary aspects of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright moments.

E. Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time adrift on ""the desert cities of waves."" The author employs striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both isolating and enlightening."

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who share their different jobs, discussing the positives, negatives, and what a typical day looks like for them.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and arrive at work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries last about three hours, but some can take all day. Occasionally, I work for ten hours straight without eating or taking a break. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about the next day’s tasks. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it is incredibly rewarding, making up for the times it doesn’t. From 10 am to 1 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain the surgeries to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time constraints can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call and carry my bleeper. During holidays, I often worry about my patients for the first few days, and I sometimes dream about operating. I struggle to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. I work in a team of three senior designers, a partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. My work is mostly production, with only 10 to 15 percent being actual design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, especially with tight deadlines. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to a pub. If the client is happy with my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project I worked hard on gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be as late as 8:30 pm or later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on two or three mornings a week, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long-haul flights from Heathrow or Gatwick. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I need to be careful about my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. Clients often ask for recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing me to plan my routes. While some passengers can be rude, most are polite, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. I sometimes hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11 am, we take a break for a big breakfast at a local café. I often wish time would slow down. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden design, I usually schedule a consultation in the evening. We focus on using old materials to create gardens that look historic. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren’t great, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we designed bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business phone. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, leaving me exhausted at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows for creativity.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. As the assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that contractors are following the schedule and safety guidelines while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on their updates. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. Lunch is typically from 2 pm to 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we monitor the contractors' work, it can lead to conflicts, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but I act quickly if something urgent arises. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and reach the office by 7:30 am. My job involves managing customer development programs for our credit card users. I am responsible for launching and overseeing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I maintain contact with current card users, attract new ones, and build partnerships with other companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program across Europe, which requires meetings with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different European markets once or twice a week to address any issues. When I am in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by reviewing the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes daily, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. I listen to demo tapes carefully, knowing that they represent people's hard work, and I aim to provide constructive feedback. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, selecting songs, producers, and additional musicians. I also communicate my vision for the album to the marketing team. I manage budgets and expenses as well. I typically leave work by 7:00 pm, and most evenings I attend concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new bands in one night. After a concert, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life often revolves around my work, and I usually get home around 1:00 am, where I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I start by opening the mail and checking the schedule for client meetings. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and feel satisfied when I sell a piece of furniture, knowing it will be appreciated. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, sourcing them from auctions, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with our full-time restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while enjoying coffee to stay updated on the industry, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle the accounts once a month and complete tax returns every three months. I usually leave work at 5:30 pm and it takes me about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am and start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over from the night shift. I manage one of four control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working for about an hour and a half at one station, then taking a half-hour break before switching to another station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle around 1,000 movements daily, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic regulations. This job requires full attention, so I don’t hesitate to take sick leave if I’m not feeling well. The work can be stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. My first task is to set up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the register and coordinate lunch and break times for staff. In the morning, I assist customers in finding and ordering books. I enjoy helping customers, although it can be challenging when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers' representatives visit, and I discuss upcoming titles with them. I need to estimate how many copies of a new title we might sell. When we want to feature a new book, I ensure it arrives on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work a late shift, during which I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. My first task is to contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my area of responsibility. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, aiming to warn clients about potential issues in those countries. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second deadline is at 11:00 am, so I need to work quickly. I write the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on specific events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax afterward; I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and drives change. Leadership is not about physical traits like height or just intelligence. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about making things happen with the help of enthusiastic people. A good leader should express enthusiasm clearly and confidently. Dixon emphasizes the importance of saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support, while the worst made you feel unimportant and withheld information, blaming you when things went wrong. The first was a great leader; the second was a poor manager.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers prefer to work within set limits, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, states that a good manager can keep a struggling company running, but a good leader can revitalize a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, improving your leadership skills can be beneficial. Here are some lessons to consider:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and act on your inspiration.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a valuable part of you.  
- Collaboration is important, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, take the lead instead and see how it changes the outcome.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

F. Leadership does not happen by itself. It develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will immediately win over your colleagues; it might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Understand when your leadership is essential and how you can help others grow as leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine trapped deep underwater. The friendly banter and brave attitude of foreman Bud and his team remind us of similar heroes in films by Howard Hawks. The film's visuals and special effects are outstanding, but the dialogue and character development feel weak. Despite the skill in filmmaking, the story is basic B-movie material.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of James Jones's novel about the Guadalcanal battle, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different perspective compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's style is mystical and poetic, Marton's film is more traditional, focusing on a single soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially in a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife, which is portrayed more harshly than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
This entertaining swashbuckler, inspired by Paul Feval's 1875 novel, stands out among musketeer films. Fabrice Luchini plays a cunning villain who secretly causes chaos. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is brief. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for a light-hearted film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama clichés with such charm and energy that it doesn't feel like a problem.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this serious film features detailed production and costume design that make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is harsh when evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on historical details, neglecting the dark and powerful message of the tale.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill, especially in sound editing, where every sound is clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement back. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
Promoted as featuring ""forty-eight international stars,"" this three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck has four directors and 23,000 extras, making it feel overly complicated. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news about the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is an impressive logistical achievement, it is best experienced on the big screen. Watching it on video diminishes the impact."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed very engaging. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He unexpectedly has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the very end, and there is a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a strong debut in a popular genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with an exciting event and follows the charming Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church intrigue, and serious murder, but we are confident he will uncover the guilty parties. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a unique new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who seems well-suited for some detective work when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing criticism from various people—perhaps tax inspectors are used to this— and the disapproval of a handsome local detective sergeant, brave and adaptable Leah proves to be a strong character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features the intelligent private investigator Spenser, who helps his friend Hawk remove drug dealers from a troubled neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is quick and sharp, and while there are fewer deaths than usual, there is more philosophical discussion. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, as they investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's straightforward writing style and keen observation of unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by the husband-and-wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book skillfully combines elements of romance, money, and violence to create a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher in a new role as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels that this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but in shifting his star actor from dark comedy to farce, he delivers a performance that is not up to his usual high standard.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best work in a while. Canadian police are on the hunt for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow and expertly crafted build-up of tension, along with the portrayal of the intelligent but disturbed robber, elevates this book above the typical detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this leap. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and when I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened: I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m no longer in a relationship and don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of this freedom, at least for my friends' sake! 

Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, 'I might as well enjoy the summer in England,' and then, 'Why not wait for the start of the football season?' Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can handle backpacking again. Will I adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their established lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says there’s a growing realization that adventure is available: 'People who always say ""I wish I had that opportunity"" are realizing they can have it whenever they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.'

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I’m willing to give up job security for this trip,' says Danny. 'There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career and will return to the same position, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was a time of change. 'In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to break free from that to live well as a civilian.'

While there are many reasons for traveling at this age, some common factors exist. 'Today, we have a more flexible workforce,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even allowing career breaks. 'If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s good to know they’ll return instead of going to a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, says more thirty-somethings are reassessing their lives. 'If you’re not happy with your job—and many aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t permanent. Travel allows you to reflect and think about your life.'

Is giving in to wanderlust just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. 'It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about just paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ""Is this what I want?""' Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he’s not running away. 'It’s more about running towards something. I want to pursue my own goals.' But he feels some anxiety. 'I’ll miss my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having my morning coffee.' I share Ben’s concerns about leaving behind a structured life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, 'This is common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel.' 

It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll take pride in having embraced life. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."""
CAE_42,"**Transforming Home into a Workplace**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the technological changes. In this passage, she shares how she turned her home into an efficient workspace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was fading away due to technology. A quick look at my resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. I felt that no one would trust me with a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I lacked. I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was known as the family technophobe; even calculators confused me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to act quickly to fill the gap in my career. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching television, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

The children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous, fearing I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn’t very skilled, I learned the basics. It turned out to be logical and straightforward. With practice, I improved a little each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always a chaotic mess, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. For a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask for information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are downsides to working from home. I can feel isolated without physical contact with others. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the children are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Yet, many people are buying multimedia PCs not just for education and entertainment but also for convenience, avoiding the daily commute to the city.

As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless in this digital age."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out against the historic backdrop of Edinburgh. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You can't miss the new Museum of Scotland, located at the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh. It features a large yellow sandstone tower and unique, wedge-shaped buildings topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more critical. Now, as the inside prepares for its opening, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.

Forget debates about whether the museum tells a national story or follows a timeline. The answer is yes; it presents a rich tapestry of stories linked to important historical objects. There is a timeline to help visitors navigate, but it does not restrict the displays. The museum does not let its valuable treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the silver from Holyrood chapel, be overshadowed by national pride.

The main concern, assuming the collections are well-preserved, is whether visitors will find the museum engaging enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that a visit should be enjoyable and visually appealing, aimed at those with little prior knowledge. Despite this openness, Clarke insists on a strict approach to what is displayed. He believes that recreations of the past that rely on imagination are misleading. He states, ""The public deserves the truth.""

At this museum, what you see is based on expert knowledge. However, the challenge for visitors is whether the stories of the objects can be communicated effectively through explanation panels, captions, and multimedia displays, with only about 30 computers available throughout the museum. Just days before the opening, it remains uncertain.

Some aspects are clear, though. The stunning views of Edinburgh Castle are breathtaking. Inside, visitors notice a series of interconnected galleries of various sizes and shapes, with pale walls designed to resemble large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light pours in through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space for visitors to reflect on each item.

Thanks to a 12-member Junior board made up of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum also features a Discovery Centre. The group wanted to create an interactive experience, but instead, they secured a dedicated hands-on area for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition gallery. Consequently, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, set to change every three years. It showcases items chosen by Scottish people and notable figures that have significantly influenced life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is entertaining, it feels somewhat superficial and does not fully address more serious topics. However, the computerized collection of personal stories and memories will be available next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke is correct in saying that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it is impressive from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in its location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"**The Future of Print Media: A Complex Transition**

The term ""transition"" suggests a smooth change from one state to another. While change can be daunting for some, it usually implies a gradual movement from the present to the future. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is not straightforward and can be quite uncomfortable. Many believe this change is inevitable, as print newspaper sales are declining while online visits are increasing. For instance, major newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, while their website traffic continues to rise.

Yet, the situation is not entirely clear. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers revealed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies daily. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. Interestingly, news magazines, which many thought would struggle in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend is seen in the book industry. E-readers like Kindle are becoming very popular, with significant sales growth this year. However, when bookstores assessed their sales of physical books over the past six months, they found only a slight decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that both digital and print formats can coexist.

The idea that young people are completely abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe show varying trends: Britain has seen a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, while Germany's decline is only 7%, and France has experienced a mere 3.1% fall.

These differences indicate that the situation is more complex than the advocates of digital media suggest. In the past, analysts believed that rising online advertising revenues would support the transition to digital newspapers. However, with digital ad revenues now declining, this assumption seems outdated. Many US newspapers have introduced paywalls to charge for online access. Interestingly, offering a print subscription along with digital access appears to be an effective strategy to attract paying readers. Print editions still play a vital role in selling online subscriptions, as print advertising generates significantly more revenue than online ads.

Maintaining both a print edition and an online presence is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print media still holds a strong presence, and being noticed online can be much more difficult."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most fascinating subjects to photograph. A picture that includes a person is usually more interesting than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes change how people behave.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Have people stand at different angles and distances, and if possible, at different heights. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A picture can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, and they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of direct eye contact, you can have the subject focus on something in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it allows the viewer to see what the subject is looking at. Candid shots can be very engaging, and the subject's expression is important.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be striking, the background can add context and interest. When including a background, avoid irrelevant details or blur them to keep the focus on the subject. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people are interacting—like talking, laughing, or working together—can lead to great photos. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams are all good subjects. Look for eye contact or physical connections, like a hand on an arm, to show relationships.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. An elevated camera position can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed picture is best. However, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, creating lasting memories."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means her paintings create an illusion of reality that tricks the eye. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her unique perspective on art.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work unless asked, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork itself is more important than the artist. ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work,"" she says. Sarah is very humble and almost wants people to think her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting magazine interview. ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" she admits, and she becomes nervous when asked to be photographed.

After some time, Sarah relaxes, and the interview turns into a fun and engaging conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, following two years of intense drawing at art school, a degree in graphic illustration, and work at a publishing house. However, she found illustration unfulfilling and joined a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil piece, and that sparked her passion. ""Suddenly my interest got channelled,"" she explains. She started her own business, unsure of where it would lead but feeling it was the right path.

Sarah's keen observation skills and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil art. She often gets asked where to learn this technique, but she believes it cannot be taught. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she insists. She remains humble, saying she is still learning. ""The moment you think you've mastered a field, you might as well give up.""

She is also honest about her weaknesses, like her inability to paint bread convincingly. When faced with a large project for a chapel ceiling, she struggled with the measurements and questioned her abilities. ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" she thought. This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work in the third person, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it; she did.'""

Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art stands out from others, especially as the style has become popular again, but not always successfully. She has completed many significant projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to two more rooms.

However, trompe-l'oeil art has a challenge: once people understand the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this well. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it has to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold your attention and engage your imagination. That is the most important part.""

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil should also be personal to the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she listens carefully to understand their vision. Many clients become friends, especially since she often works closely with them on-site. 

Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which keeps her busy, despite her modesty. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" While this may be true, it is hard to become bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves more recognition, and I am willing to promote it, even if she might not like it."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the important 'people skills' needed to succeed in our careers.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now evaluated not only on our intelligence and training but also on how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is increasingly used in hiring decisions and promotions. It helps identify who is likely to excel and who may not. These skills are important for our future job prospects, regardless of our current field. The ability to perform well in exams is becoming less relevant. The new focus assumes we all have the necessary knowledge and skills for our jobs. Instead, it emphasizes social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—collectively known as emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For years, these qualities have been referred to by various names, such as 'character' and 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and those of others, using emotions to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people mistakenly think it just means being nice. However, it can sometimes require being direct and honest, even if it’s uncomfortable. Emotional intelligence is about managing feelings so they are expressed appropriately, allowing people to work together effectively towards shared goals.

C. More businesses recognize that promoting emotional intelligence is vital for good management. In complex jobs, emotional intelligence becomes even more important because a lack of these skills can limit the effectiveness of a person's technical knowledge. While some individuals have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that foster teamwork gain a competitive advantage. In today’s work environment, which values teamwork and customer focus, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.

D. Unlike IQ, which changes little over time, emotional intelligence can develop as we gain life experience. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills as they grow older. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and add them to our toolkit for success, especially in a time when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human element can prevent everything else from functioning effectively."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media profit from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed citizen photography significantly. As news often breaks on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms for images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there are guidelines stating that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC will play a significant role in the future of the media. However, to maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that individuals are fairly compensated for their work and that permission is always obtained.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old and is part of traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, physical manipulation, and exercise. While acupuncture can treat various health issues, it is particularly noted for its effectiveness in pain relief. Many general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it for this purpose.

**A. Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine**

Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to a specific organ, and many smaller ones that deliver Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or disrupted, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a consultation, an acupuncturist will assess where these imbalances occur by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and looking at your overall health. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and lifestyle habits like eating and sleeping.

**B. Acupuncture Points**

The acupuncture points correspond to the meridians and may not be located near the area of pain. Patients often report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done manually or with an electro-acupuncture device. Practitioners believe this sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in the meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more used less frequently.

**C. Scientific Understanding**

Even without accepting traditional Chinese medicine's principles, many Western doctors recognize that acupuncture can help relieve pain. Scientific explanations suggest that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain. Additionally, some researchers believe that acupuncture may trigger the release of natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body, known as endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**

Many individuals with chronic pain turn to acupuncture when other treatments have failed. Commonly treated conditions include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain experienced by terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Applications of Acupuncture**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over two millennia, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped persuade some doctors outside China of acupuncture's effectiveness. Today, acupuncture is used in various surgical procedures in China, including tonsillectomies and heart surgeries. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or alongside medications. While pain relief varies from person to person, many report significant pain reduction. Acupuncturists argue that acupuncture has fewer side effects than traditional anesthetics, such as nausea, and allows for quicker recovery.

**F. Effectiveness of Acupuncture**

Conducting clinical trials on acupuncture can be challenging, but studies show that 50 to 80 percent of patients find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate, acknowledging that it may not work for everyone. They suggest that patients with long-term pain may need six to seven sessions to experience significant relief, although some improvement can often be felt after just two or three visits.

**G. A Holistic Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine have different perspectives on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering not just the symptoms but also the overall health of the patient. They spend time diagnosing the underlying issues related to Qi and consider external factors that may affect pain, such as weather conditions. This comprehensive view is less common in conventional medical practice.

**H. Traditional vs. Modern Practices**

Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that applying the principles of traditional Chinese medicine is essential for achieving lasting healing, which can be difficult to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further evaluation if needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she carries an air of quiet confidence. One can easily imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she had not chosen to write detective stories filled with unexpected twists. However, it quickly becomes clear that her confident demeanor is a cover for her shyness. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh prefers to solve crimes alone, just like James prefers to write in solitude. She needs complete privacy to write, no matter where she is.

Despite her success, she is too humble to agree that she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, even though millions read her twelve major detective novels worldwide. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell's psychological novels, written under the name Barbara Vine. The books she enjoys most are often by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers great novelists.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up in Cambridge after her family moved there when she was 11. She met her husband, a university student, in Cambridge, which is why she set her book An Unsuitable Job For A Woman there. She shares that her life has had its challenges, including the struggles she faced when her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill. To support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane, she worked long hours. Although she had many ideas for stories, she had little time to write. Thankfully, her husband's parents helped care for her daughters during those tough times.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but her interest was not in death itself. Instead, she was drawn to the structure and creativity involved in writing crime novels. She has always loved reading detective stories and knew she wanted to be a writer.

James did not want to write about her own traumatic experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a great way to learn the craft of serious novel writing while keeping her personal life separate. Over time, she realized that it was possible to follow the traditional format of a detective story and still create a meaningful novel about human nature. She believes that writing detective stories helps bring order to chaos, and solving a crime affirms the value of life, even if that life is difficult. Ultimately, she notes that no one truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can significantly influence whether you are considered suitable for the position. Handwriting analysis, known as graphology, is recognized as a legitimate science in many places. Researchers suggest it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can also reveal emotional and psychological states.

Graphology is increasingly used for career guidance and as a supplement to job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the effectiveness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes it deserves more attention. She argues that handwriting can reflect psychological traits and some medical conditions. According to her, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental abilities, whether someone should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a manipulative or honest character.""

Ms. Marne claims that graphology can be particularly useful in identifying potential criminal behavior. She notes that criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which can be poorly shaped and sometimes childish. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and may show signs of emotional immaturity in their handwriting. She states, ""I can determine if people are honest, manipulative, or trustworthy."" 

Young male offenders often have tall letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can also predict if someone is under extreme stress or has violent tendencies. Handwriting can even indicate suicidal thoughts. Ms. Marne explains that heart and lung issues can also be reflected in handwriting. While one sample may not provide enough information, changes in handwriting over time, such as a previously stable signature becoming shaky, can signal serious problems. A significant emotional upset may also temporarily alter a person's signature.

Ms. Marne describes how handwriting can reveal various psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect like threads may be clever but deceptive. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting shows confidence and creativity, while disconnected writing often indicates a person who prefers solitude. Small signatures can reflect feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter ""i"" may indicate a desire for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can suggest intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Ms. Marne believes that it takes six years of study and experience to accurately analyze handwriting, along with empathy and intuition. She feels more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific discipline, and she is optimistic that this will happen soon. She claims, ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without needing to ask potentially misleading questions.""

Despite these intriguing claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the writing style taught, and does not hold any deeper significance."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and comfortable chairs are essential for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a recent survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their assessments.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very basic; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. Surprisingly, the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to how they would at home. This may be the reason for their happiness: they have created a comfortable, homely work environment without unnecessary rules.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and often creates poor posture. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule that they control, which includes office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety helps reduce fatigue and boredom.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Employees enjoy the variety of tasks and the flexible office space. They feel the office is ""just the right size""—small enough to know what others are doing, yet large enough to focus on individual work. The office is attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, partly due to a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with plain grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most employees have been there for over five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by rearranging desks to facilitate sharing information and displaying project updates on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office receives mixed reviews. It feels like being in a glass case, surrounded by many similar spaces. Despite having both smokers and non-smokers, the air quality is acceptable.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and uninspiring. The desks are barely adequate, and not all chairs meet ergonomic standards. Many computer screens are on low desks, which is not suitable for modern equipment.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. The office has many awards on display, but the wood paneling and brown carpet create a dull atmosphere. However, the office is busy and active.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many issues. The air conditioning is poorly controlled, leading to uncomfortable temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most desks are too small. Dust is a problem, as it collects in many areas.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is more suitable for a workshop than a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not support proper posture, especially for shorter users.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old, dirty chairs and carpets, and it needs a thorough cleaning. Individual achievements should be recognized more, and the air conditioning needs immediate improvement due to many smokers. During our visit, there were few conversations, and everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, accessible to everyone, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks every day. This ancient practice has turned into a large business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, including added pine resins and softeners that help maintain flavor and improve texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum for cleaning their teeth and freshening their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, pieces of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, marking the beginning of commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic, leading to the growth of a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the demand for chewing gum increased, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, struggle to make a living. They trek for miles to collect sap from scattered sapodilla trees in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One particularly troublesome insect, the chicle fly, lays its eggs in the ears and noses of the gatherers. Despite these risks, experienced chicleros can quickly climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp where it is boiled and turned into bricks.

Life at the camp is difficult, with a boring and often inadequate diet based mainly on maize, accompanied by a local alcohol made from sugar cane. Despite these harsh conditions, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.

As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have shifted to synthetic ingredients to lower costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. They claim that chewing gum helps people relax, boosts energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were regularly given gum. One of the main benefits of gum is that it can help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides important minerals. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva production.

Research continues on new textures and flavors for gum. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to create the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The hotel offers basic facilities, with hot water provided by bucket, but these simple aspects enhance its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I discovered it by chance while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we had to walk down. To my surprise, we found this hotel at the bottom, set in stunning, wild countryside. Arriving tired and finding such luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter, was an unforgettable experience.

**C. MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. Although the hotel is large and offers many free water sports, you can easily find solitude along its nine kilometers of private beach. Swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, and the hotel becomes hidden behind palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the peaceful beach as the sky darkens.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most stunning views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and located at 1,000 feet above sea level, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel features colonial-style furniture made of mahogany and greenheart wood, and has four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is an ideal escape from the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very picturesque. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel, painted white with red domes, is modeled after a historic hotel on the French Riviera. Although it is a bit worn down now, it still retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau surrounded by a moat with two swans. This chateau, which was a family home until recently, has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, along with complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel that avoids excessive luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers recovering from safaris and planning their next adventure. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and inviting rooms, and decide to stay longer. The hotel has apartments for those who want to settle in for a few months. Located on Nairobi Hill, it feels far removed from the busy city center. It’s a great place to enjoy the stunning African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**

The restaurant serves delicious, simple food, and the hotel features beautiful Persian rugs and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector who evaluates hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, problems began to arise, although the hotel staff were unaware of it. The receptionist was busy giving room rates over the phone to a potential guest and did not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispered, noting this poor service. This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expected better from a hotel with three red stars, which means it is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.

Before they even received a warm welcome, Sue noticed that the entrance from the car park was through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. ""This is not what I expected,"" she said. Things got worse when the receptionist informed them, in a cheerful tone, that there was no record of their booking. It turned out that most of the hotel’s 15 rooms were empty that night. The only available room was on the top floor, but Sue found it stuffy and noticed a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

In her early career, Sue earned a reputation for being tough, even though she claims she is not. The next morning, after paying her bill, she revealed her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves, who looked terrified. He quickly apologized for a bad smell in the main lounge, explaining that there might be a blocked drain. Sue suggested that he should guide guests to another lounge instead of the one with the smell. Greaves, who had only been at the hotel for five months, took notes and seemed unsure about Sue's advice, even though she assured him that her feedback would help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything was negative; Sue praised Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, for their knowledge about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also met the standards to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which encouraged Greaves to ask how they could achieve three rosettes. Sue's response was simple: ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves’ enthusiasm faded at this suggestion.

Sue's job is to express the complaints that many customers are too afraid to voice. She recalled a time when a woman complained that Sue had gotten her son fired for serving apple pie with his fingers. She often receives letters with false accusations, which can be hurtful, but she has learned to expect them. Sue must provide both verbal and written reports of her findings to the hotel, as they pay for her expertise. Despite the challenges, being recognized with red stars makes her work worthwhile. It was good news for Greaves that Sue would not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars, but the bad news was that another inspector would return in two months to ensure improvements were made. ""Good,"" Greaves said with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,"**Seven Summits: A Mountaineer's Journey**

Doug Scott, an experienced mountaineer, shares his incredible experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit, Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, had a strange conversation about sleeping bags, even though they were alone. Doug felt the effects of low oxygen and began talking to his feet, which were getting cold. He remembered other climbers who had lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug reflected on their time on the summit ridge and felt grateful to have Dougal with him, as he inspired confidence. Doug focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit, which he successfully did.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Considered one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier in April 1976. They spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, they realized how challenging their task was. They followed a route established in 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a first for this area. After facing tough conditions, including a wet sleeping bag and strong winds, they finally reached the summit and celebrated their achievement.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite planned to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro after getting a free ride. They got lost in the dense jungle, which was concerning due to the lack of water. On the second day, they found a trail marked by arrows and some litter, leading them to a rock pool. They attempted a challenging climb but decided to take a safer route to the summit instead.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met fellow climber Phil Erscheler. Phil invited them to join his group, which was taking a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they set off. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to follow the standard route instead. Despite strong winds, they reached the summit just before dark and camped outside a refuge. At base camp, they met climbers from the Jakarta Mountaineering Club, who encouraged Doug to pursue the Seven Summits goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug realized that climbing Vinson Massif was possible by guiding others to cover the costs. In late November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, creating a unique atmosphere. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite harsh winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg and traveled to Terskol, near Elbrus. They faced a fee for bringing foreigners into the valley, but it was later waived. After acclimatizing, they took a cable car to 3,900 meters and then walked to a refuge at 4,200 meters. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they had reached the summit but discovered there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team aimed to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about potential dangers from bandits but decided to proceed. On May 12, they began climbing, and the weather improved. Two team members moved ahead while Doug and Sham, who was filming, climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

Style influences many aspects of our lives today, from clothing to home decor and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest trends for fashion enthusiasts this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to steer clear of traditional, stiff designs and overly frilly styles, opting instead for simpler looks. Ingham has been sketching and designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he attended fashion school, where he learned how to cut and sew clothes. However, you don’t need to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening gowns, updated with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, Ingham offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, a staple in women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh, contemporary twist.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail previously worked for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery design. She began creating her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to start her own design business in 1990, and now her jewellery is popular among many celebrities. Her signature style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Just four years after entering the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson has had two of her designs chosen for a major exhibition, despite only taking a basic art and design course. Her handbags are always noticed, as they are handmade in the UK and exude glamour, whether made from luxurious calfskin or rich silk. A Grimson bag combines elegance and attention to detail, making it truly special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous individuals. He understands that most women want a natural look that they can manage at home. His unique approach ensures that clients don’t look like they just left a salon. However, this relaxed style comes at a price—£250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Leveraging his fame, Peter has launched his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who can’t visit his salon to achieve their desired looks at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and works as a consultant for a large supermarket chain, providing floral ideas for top restaurants. Remarkably, she has no formal qualifications in floristry and left her teaching job ten years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern and simple floral arrangements have won numerous design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also enjoyed successful lecture tours in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements today should be simple yet striking, avoiding excessive leaves, which can be too large and overpowering. For wedding bouquets, she emphasizes that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses and took nearly two years of work. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to track guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will find the hotel particularly appealing, as MacCann estimates that about 65% of their business comes from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables and renting televisions, which can be easily replaced with newer models.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished rooms that are inviting and cozy. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion is exceptional, thanks to Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who moved his two-Michelin-star restaurant to the hotel. This move has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant on-site is a great advantage with minimal financial risk. With its combination of technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_24,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the entire garden, although she sometimes paints groups of plants in their natural setting. More often, she picks the flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days, and then I bring in another one to continue the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and you're so busy,"" she says. However, she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; I thought garden flowers looked fake, like silk or plastic ones sold in some shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden features many plants from distant lands, but they thrive just as well as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"**Title: Changes in Brackham**

In March, strong storms caused many trees in the Brackham area to fall. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. This change upset many residents who preferred the town's traditional look. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, he was too ill to notice because he was suffering from bronchitis for the first time in his life. 

When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. He refused, thinking the police needed him. As a result, he became forgetful and irritable. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor, and he had no energy left to argue. Soon after, he got his antibiotics and returned home, where Molly sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen, he was too weak to fully understand. Later that evening, he asked if the house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then covered himself with the sheets. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked and he felt better, that he noticed how much the loss of the walnut tree changed the living room's appearance.

The Pelhams lived in a large house with a big garden, which they had bought without regrets. The garden had given them a sense of privacy. Before the storm, the walnut tree had provided a nice view from the living room, creating interesting light patterns that hid the worn furniture they had brought from their old home. Now, without the tree, the room felt too bright, exposing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was also unpleasant; the tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its unattractive purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham asked his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed more happy than upset. ""I've been saying this since we moved in. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. However, in the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not truly trouble us. The real threat was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently but now posed a danger. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow began to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These ominous grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we focused on the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and nearing a dangerous level. Then it happened – for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed furious as the water rushed down towards its lower stretches. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream looked wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, angrily pushing against its banks. For three days, we prayed that it would stay below its limits. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held, and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the huge clouds over the valley and appreciate the great power of the river. Thanks to the dam, we feel that our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing film articles for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviews of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but since Tom was not mainly a journalist, he was not very careful in choosing his team. 

Initially, he wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need special knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to keep things friendly. At that time, it felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. I even thought a millionaire was pretending to hire me. I lacked self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with my review, I felt embarrassed.

Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out as planned. Although it was a good idea, we didn’t meet as expected, and everything was done over the phone. It turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject, so I chose to write about films. Without Tom's initial support, we might not have developed the current system, where I write a detailed weekly piece about one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn’t enjoy the typical film critic role, which requires reviewing every new film. That routine would quickly make me feel bored. I would dread sitting down on a Monday morning, thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?"" 

The freedom I have allows me to expand my arguments or, during a dull week, to create something interesting from little. But what is my role in the public eye? I believe people choose films based on stars, marketing, or the director. There is also loyalty to certain types of films. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a critic's opinion. So, if a film review isn’t really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel I need to be ""right"" about a movie. I also don’t think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. My job is simply to present an argument. I am not a judge, and I don’t want to be one."
FCE_46,"**Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun.""**

**Teenager with a passion for endurance**

**WANTED:** A sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. You should be very enthusiastic about distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (a love for 100km rides is helpful). You must be able to do all three activities without taking a break.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. While it may be exciting for spectators, what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, with great academic achievements, give up so much for the challenges of this sport?

Melanie Sears has not yet learned the common phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenges, and setting higher goals that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you get cold. After the 40km bike ride, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you’re tired. But it’s really fun, and it’s all worth it in the end,"" she explains.

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried the whole time I was running.""

But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would end, but I’m afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would want to do it again."" This determination earns her respect from Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I just tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, while most people would step off when they realize they can’t go any further; she just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That’s why I’m working very hard on it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it’s a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, there is a cost to her dedication. Her intense training has made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she admits. ""I’m not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we discuss our times and achievements.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, including the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher competitions than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It’s interesting, isn’t it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with excitement, envy, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember: only collect items you truly love.

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans gathered pebbles and wore them as necklaces, attracted by their shapes and colors. This was their first attempt to collect objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed; children still collect stones and seashells simply for their beauty.

I have been a collector all my life, gathering everything from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I attended a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by others. I was captivated by these items. Interestingly, I am not alone in my interest; many adults share this passion.

People collect for various reasons, and it has become a topic of interest. Some believe it is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, it is simply a joyful activity. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and man-made curiosities, like coconut shell cups and carved ivory beads. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected diverse items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, with great determination.

I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Sadly, this collection was lost in a house fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, looking at the ruins of my furniture and collection, unsure which loss hurt more.

I have always been fascinated by how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet adds value to items traded in markets. As certain small objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now considered valuable, especially if you kept their original boxes. Unfortunately, I threw away both the boxes and the toys!"

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic and talk to experts to understand the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to display and ensure the public can understand the exhibition. This involves planning interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure the exhibition is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, learning how to navigate the city. They find the most direct routes, considering one-way streets and turns. I step in when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they prepare for the test, I give them a simple route but tell them they must take a different one because the road is closed. This forces them to think creatively about their routes.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job involves answering phone inquiries, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about marine life. I take them out to sea to help them understand the underwater environment better, which often changes their perspectives. I feel fortunate because conservation is my passion, but since I work for a charity, I constantly seek funding and cannot always achieve everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite diverse. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain a stock of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a passionate team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**No Title**

Every June, we traveled to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a large house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple, the Malseeds, who own the house, have made some additions, but they did it very tastefully. Strafe discovered Glencorn for us. He found an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to promote their place. One evening, he suggested, ""How about this?"" and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was a disappointment because the food was terrible.

The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, although my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is probably why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it’s a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, welcoming us again this year with a smile. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she instructed the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she named the rooms we would stay in. Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when few guests come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of small details like that, while her husband handles repairs and redecorating.

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled widely, his dark brown eyes sparkling, making us feel like we were more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was perfect.

Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play too long because we were still tired from the journey. 

In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other guests at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the cliff path to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this routine well because over the years, we had developed this pattern. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."
FCE_67,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for guests who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she explains.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. After having her own breakfast, she prepares breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. By 9:30 a.m., after the guests have finished eating, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds to be the least enjoyable part of her job. By around 11 a.m., she is ready to ski herself, enjoying the slopes until about 4:30 p.m. 

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful,"" she says, recalling a fun breakfast experience, while noting that some weeks are not as enjoyable.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start their night at a place called Bananas, then might go to G Jay's and finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she makes sure not to stay out too late on Saturdays, as Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, ""especially when you have to cook breakfast with a headache.""

On Sundays, Sarah starts work earlier, preparing breakfast for guests leaving by 7 a.m. Once they leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast, stripping beds, and getting everything ready for new guests. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which she finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but often she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory wearing overalls and large shoes, with messy hair framing her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

Several times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie had been fascinated by the steam-heated brass hands used to shape the gloves, which she called ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside one?"" 

""Not yet,"" she said. 

""You should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. It's a basic place. The technology has improved, but it’s not very different from what it was hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; they found 6,000-year-old tanning artifacts in Turkey. The first clothing was just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is a leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk for two days about gloves. Glovemakers love their trade. 

""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" 

""Not really,"" she replied. 

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" 

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" 

Seymour laughed. She was innocent and eager to learn, reminding him of Marie, who was much taller than Rita but shared her spirit and intelligence. 

""I have an idea. We will take you through the entire glove-making process. Come on! We’re going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""
FCE_71,"**Is It a Tough Job?** Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she must travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss. However, she has one small issue—she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so cramped with those tiny windows."" When she is back on the ground, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning travel, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group’s manager led to her working behind the scenes. She also took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he prefers caddying because golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which averages between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You’re not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge of the game, and try to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, and he became a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are valuable for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to taste food at the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? ""For those who can afford it, it’s their choice,"" he says. ""I’d rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in my guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain’s most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. Having been a farmer, I knew about the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called *The Fox Busters*, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It’s not easy; I have to work hard at them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don’t wake up at dawn, unfortunately. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning—all with one finger on an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop."" He receives between 50 and 100 letters a week, which he enjoys the most about being a writer. He tries to answer them all, but now he has some secretarial help."
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Surrounding it were large piles of soft sawdust, creating golden mounds that extended to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too.

Still laughing, he watched as they hesitated on the roof, looking scared. One by one, they jumped down, relieved to land safely. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them suggested going back up to the roof to jump again. Although they were not very excited, they climbed back up and jumped off in a determined manner until only Michael was left. The others called up to him, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?""

Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed at the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning foolishly, wondering why the jump had seemed easier the first time. For a while, they thought he was just joking, but then they noticed him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but when that didn’t work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Eventually, the boys began to laugh at him, growing tired of waiting as dinner time approached. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn’t move, they started to leave, still teasing him.

""Who started this?"" he called after them. But he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He stayed there alone for nearly an hour while the sun set slowly over the lake. His clothes were damp from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone.

He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home in time for dinner by now. If you won't come home, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a hint of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. Although she spoke firmly, Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the boys' grinning faces and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change their careers seek help from a careers adviser. You will need to write a brief personal history and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. Afterward, you will receive a summary of the results, along with career suggestions and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest career advice organizations. Taking the career test felt like being back in a science exam. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I reminded myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was difficult to see how the psychometric tests could accurately represent me. The tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. 

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, but I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are relieved I didn’t become a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean a complete shift. Last March, after losing her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney sought help from Career Analysts. She said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to reflect on my career. I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But in the end, I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial responsibilities,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, she decided to use her existing skills and move into a field that suited her better than insurance. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she truly wanted to do. She has recommended the service to several friends, all of whom are satisfied.

Some people feel they would not have made significant changes without help. For example, 26-year-old Juliet Greene visited Career Counselling Services and made important life decisions. After six years at a major bank, she found her job boring and wanted a new challenge. She went to the counselling service with an open mind. The tests indicated she was interested in sciences. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget much of what you say. After the fourth meeting, I carefully considered the test results and decided to study geology. I plan to start a degree course later this year. I believe the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the cost. I feel much happier and more positive now.""

However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I felt lost. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either required a significant pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself. You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he examines their teeth. Jerome explains, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has worked to create a space where people feel comfortable. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, as many people link it to pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable environment.

This approach may surprise many, as most people associate dental visits with discomfort or clinical settings. Jerome states, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his innovative relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the initial check-up, the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then, the headset switches to a special camera that gives the patient a visual tour of their mouth.""

Interestingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their dental visit. Another important aspect is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it has a pleasant orange scent. Jerome explains, ""When people enter, I want them to realize through all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make someone anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the top priority. For instance, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping, which can feel strange at first but is not painful if the patient is relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned is that making it easier for the patient also makes it easier for the dentist,"" he says. He believes his patient-focused approach is part of a gradual shift towards a more relaxed style in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly greets him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently guides him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this luxurious treatment, and it’s easy to see why. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is now a multi-million pound global industry. During Easter, British people spend over £230 million on chocolate, accounting for eight percent of all chocolate sales. Only at Christmas do people consume more chocolate. 

Although large-scale chocolate production started in the last century, the cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often incorrectly called cocoa beans, a mistake that dates back to the 17th century when they were also referred to as cacoa and cocao beans. 

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in the Aztec language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and served during ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it more enjoyable when mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but this recipe did not reach the rest of Europe for another hundred years. 

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids, resulting in milk chocolate. 

At the turn of the century, the British chocolate market was largely controlled by French companies. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. However, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising that linked it to the health benefits of milk from the English countryside, making it a competitor to luxurious French brands. 

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars per week, prompting manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One recent marketing strategy is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are transformed into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who are bored with traditional snacks. 

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, consider the challenges faced by these farmers."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a skilled artist. He still wants to try new things, like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he focuses on creating beautiful objects from shells. As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is definitely passionate, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them,"" he says. He never intended to sell his work, but about five years ago, friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. They spoke to an art gallery owner, and he ended up having a successful exhibition in London, selling 70% of his pieces. His second exhibition just opened, featuring 86 items, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Cooke says he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes his work is unique, and the gallery owner told him that once he stops creating, people will want his pieces even more.

Cooke wishes he had started this art earlier in life, as he feels he could have made even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels limited physically compared to when he began. However, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in tourist shops. He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, detailed pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own techniques and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue bought in bulk, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he says about his creative process. Yet, the detail, color, and symmetry in his work are clearly intentional.

Cooke searches for beautiful, tiny shells not just on the beaches of Norfolk, but also in places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming the environment. ""When I collect shells, I see many people stepping on them much faster than I can gather them. The sea also breaks them down. I would never take shells with living creatures inside, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is strong, especially considering the beauty he creates from the shells he finds."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who models and appears on magazine covers. When she is not working, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

The receptionist at Kira's modeling agency told me she would be late. I thought about all the negative things I had read about models, like being difficult or vain. I worried she might not show up at all. But when Kira arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and accompanied by her mother. She wore a simple black dress and trainers, showing no signs of being spoiled. Kira was friendly, tall, and pretty. 

Since Kira is under 16, she must have an adult with her for work. Her mother, who looked proud of her daughter, was just a regular mom. Kira seemed a bit confused by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter a modeling competition. Kira initially said no, but her sister sent in some photos anyway. When Kira learned she was a finalist, she was at school. This achievement gave her the confidence to continue, and she won the competition easily. The Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Now, Kira finds it challenging to balance her two lives. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some classmates make rude comments about her success, saying she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle, especially since she is not arrogant. She explains, ""People think I’ve changed just because I’m a model, but the only change is that I’m more confident and can stand up for myself.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day. She cannot make plans with friends because her schedule is uncertain. However, her friends understand and do not complain about her modeling commitments.

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a successful career ahead of her, even before finishing her school exams. As I wrap up the interview, I ask her what she would do if she didn’t have her beauty. She pauses and replies, ""I’d like to do what you’re doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the warm lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are sure they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions hidden in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the most promising land to explore. After clearing away plants and finding pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent the last ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running low on money. Having spent their savings on this dream, they need to convince a backer to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, but we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys last week, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are right, it would bring more visitors here, but if they find gold, I hope millions of people don’t come and disturb the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It’s adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I’ll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which involves studying the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she descends into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration, diving three kilometers down to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are accustomed to these cramped conditions, where they cannot stand or move freely, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last up to 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency and they need to ascend quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant experience,"" she says.

Rachel recalls her first time in the vehicle, which was on a ship's deck. An instructor guided her through emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a confined space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands, where there is a large area of underwater volcanoes emitting black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the impact of a multinational program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on the 'black smokers,'"" she explains. This term refers to underwater volcanoes that release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel shares a frightening experience from her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment with a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were overwhelmed with relief— they were still alive!

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an incredible adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD, and seeing them in person was an amazing experience."""
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with foreign schedules, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I told myself as I returned home. I repeated this every year after. All I needed was one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. 

Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. Carrying all your belongings in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail experience, where common sense can be forgotten along with your paperback and socks. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. 

A system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize the full potential of this train ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling non-stop was too appealing, as there was always another country just beyond the border. And the extra miles? They cost us nothing. 

We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. In planning our own schedule, we focused only on the most accessible sights. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to get by and enjoy ourselves, just like most other Inter-Railers with whom we shared train corridors, food, money, and music. 

The thrill of travel comes from arriving in a place that was once just a name. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by experiencing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be dull. While the train journey may not reveal new discoveries in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail offers the best chance to appreciate this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."
FCE_37,"Text: 'Arriving at an airport in another country only to find that your luggage is missing can be very disappointing. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. If you are in a different climate, you may have to wear clothes that are not suitable for the weather. Airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, but it is common for travelers to experience this at some point. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it is not always possible for them to ensure that your checked luggage travels on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes.

Airlines require passengers to check in early to give enough time for luggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to switch between flights, and these times are often extended to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well, but extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which may cause problems with luggage handling. Human error can also occur, such as when a destination label gets lost. These issues can be more serious at large airports, known as 'hubs', where many bags are processed. For instance, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million transferring to other flights. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to walk a mile between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-haul flights).

Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The chance of losing luggage during a plane change is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers make quick connections to Latin America. To reduce the risk of losing your luggage, choose direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all legs of your journey. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight, and make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, including flight numbers.

If your luggage does go missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, muddy browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, all as gentle as the sound of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, so striking that you can almost feel its presence. It disappears in an instant, but the image stays in your mind, its impact much greater than its small size.

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep affection for this little bird is shown by his uncertainty about what exactly attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess transformed into a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this tale. Despite the many shades of blue in their feathers, kingfishers do not have blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, reflecting blue. This is why a kingfisher can seem to change from bright blue to deep emerald green with just a slight change in light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers. Their vibrant colors, combined with the fact that kingfishers are shy but can be observed easily from a hidden spot, create a perfect opportunity for a lifelong interest. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he draped over himself while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite area. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him another four years to capture his first good photograph. During this time, the European kingfisher became a central part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream rich with kingfishers, but school limited his time with the birds. He missed classes and considered himself an ""academic failure."" Nevertheless, his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, then became an assistant to the editor, and eventually worked as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the ultimate kingfisher film: ""No speech, just beautiful images that convey everything,"" he says. ""I am drawn to simplicity. I enjoy photographing parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still captivate him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever reveal."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from New Conductors**

Giving directions to an orchestra is challenging. Anne Inglis interviews five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She unexpectedly filled in for an absent assistant and was later invited to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous; I have always felt confident in front of an orchestra."" Manson, originally from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after two unsuccessful attempts. Looking back, he feels fortunate about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have been forgotten."" The competition opened many doors for him, including a position as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being labeled as a competition winner: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned."" Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. If this doesn't continue, his career could suffer.

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size, unlike the larger conductors I had learned from before, which made a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many conflicts, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says, ""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me."" His career path is not unusual; he began as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's *Agrippina* from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I did my best to achieve that. Thankfully, people respect my overall musical ability. I learn from every experience, both in musical style and performance. Now, I am open to any opportunities to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and informed his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall quickly found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to manage some relaxed professional musicians who were reading newspapers during the performance: ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best outcome. Many orchestral musicians I’ve seen don’t seem to need much guidance from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express my needs. If people see you’re anxious, it only makes things worse. I have never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to do it, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are considering taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island might be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids enjoyed the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is also a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere and better scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were unsure what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings that he could explore! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still felt there was more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is also a lot of fun for younger children. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they realized they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not boring. It was very clean, and the staff were excellent. When I couldn’t sit with both girls on one ride, a staff member kindly offered to sit with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am quite timid, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t try the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children had been a bit older, they might have found it less exciting, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we certainly felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller coaster, the Rocket, stands out in the park, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie found the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We noticed that the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World, and we wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Since she had experience with computers, her husband encouraged her to start this business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. However, she was careful with her spending and kept the bank informed. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. Her business remains small, and most customers pick up their orders directly.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum. After moving to the countryside, where such jobs were unavailable, she decided to start her own business. She creates a collection of 50 greetings cards that she sells to museums. Maggy works in a large room upstairs. One downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She relies on word-of-mouth for business and does not advertise. Customers from London choose her because she is more affordable than other artists. Although she misses sharing ideas with others, she finds more benefits than drawbacks in her situation.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when the market was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. At one point, she managed six full-time workers, but due to an economic downturn, she had to let them go, which was difficult since jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and collaborates with women who work from their homes. Delia must be ready to lower her prices when needed and explore new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** operates a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the rural lifestyle. Tessa enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants. A large part of her income comes from international deals, so she often takes calls at unusual hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to separate work from home life. She publishes children's books that reflect various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt isolated since her professional experience was in London.

E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that earns £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. Requests from friends and family led her to send cakes across the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, employing a baker and a cake decorator. Meg no longer bakes herself, as she manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as she started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their father makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, but found it too expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years. 

After trying to make violins and violas, John successfully created his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers that it turned out well. John made another cello for Paul later, which he used until recently. John has now retired from teaching to focus on making instruments full-time, creating up to twelve violins each year. One of his violins was even sold to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo, which was a great achievement for him.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano: ""As soon as I could reach the keys, I played,"" he recalls. However, he soon became interested in the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin because John played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. Paul tried the violin for a short time but preferred the cello after being inspired by a cellist in his father's group.

Huw, now 22, also found his own path in music as a pianist and composer. He appreciated that his parents were supportive without being pushy. Instead of feeling jealous of Paul's achievements, he saw them as motivation.

Paul has had great success with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old, still using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 

Paul jokes that his father's cello might need 50 to 100 years to gain the same power as his new one, which is already 304 years old. Soon, he will perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. He believes that his performance style will always be his own, regardless of the cello's history.

However, Paul won't be able to watch his performance on TV because he will be playing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. ""You are always interacting with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies,"" he explains. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden position, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training.

Gareth finds it useful to still farm with his parents, as it allows him to relate to farmers and understand their challenges. He also has the physical strength needed for the job, which includes tasks like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers, butterfly larvae, and birds' nests as a child and now wonders where he would find those things today. He realizes that farming has changed the countryside, but he believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were following government advice.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. However, they are now communicating and understanding each other's perspectives. ""We are at a turning point, and it only takes a small step to bring them together,"" Gareth says. His work involves conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My job is to ensure tasks are completed efficiently and with minimal fuss. I enjoy seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork.""

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys every moment, especially interacting with the public. However, he finds some visitors frustrating. ""Some people come in, demand everything, and leave as if they have a right to it. Being polite to them can be annoying!"" But Gareth believes that common sense is key. If you have plenty of common sense and enjoy outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just be aware that there may not be a position available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra leads the England netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day as she prepared for the World Championships next month. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. 

I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that’s it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships. I follow a strict schedule to get fit."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it will be the largest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra warns that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don’t train hard to lose,"" Kendra said. ""But once the game is over, we become friends again.""

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. ""It’s essential that we think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explained. ""As captain, I believe it’s important to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra added, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned. I decided a while ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she may very well have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their abilities. Some parents may not recognize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help academically gifted children, musically talented children often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is not prioritized.

Children who show musical talent, especially those encouraged by parents or teachers, can benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established relatively recently. These schools create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen, allowing them to develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend a significant part of their day—between one third and one half—engaged in musical activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), participation in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The remainder of their time is dedicated to a limited academic curriculum, focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can request to study more subjects.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with smaller class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which allows them to spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some disadvantages. The cost of attending these schools is high, ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year for boarders. Each school tries to help families with scholarships and financial aid for exceptionally talented children. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

Separating musically gifted children from a young age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide support when needed. 

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic focus, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. 

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before pursuing a specialist education. Children who are also academically gifted may thrive in a less specialized setting, such as a school with a strong music program or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, along with orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days, and then I bring in another one to continue the painting. Sometimes, it can take a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and you're so busy,"" she says. However, she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in florists. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden features many plants from distant lands, and they thrive just as well as they do in their native countries like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for guests who come to ski and stay in traditional wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she explains.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. After having her own breakfast, she prepares breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. By 9:30 a.m., after the guests have finished eating, she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds to be the least enjoyable part of her job. By around 11 a.m., she is ready to ski herself, enjoying the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful,"" she says, noting that some weeks are not as enjoyable.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start their night at a place called Bananas, then might go to G Jay's and finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she makes sure not to stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, ""when you really don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired.""

On Sundays, Sarah starts work earlier, with breakfast for guests needing to be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast, stripping beds, and preparing for the next group. If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which Sarah finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, she helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie, a zookeeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my outfit for Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around when I could have been quietly cuddling an animal. Some fashion team members seemed stressed, but my job is not very stressful. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed at the thought that I would normally be cleaning cages or handling rats. I find it interesting to see how magazines operate, but I really love my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While petting an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes in a cupboard. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a fantastic day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I enjoyed being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was a lot of fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn’t include hard physical work or careful planning. I’m more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so I don’t plan to leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medicine. I thought I would feel faint during some tasks, but I surprised myself by handling it well. The friendship among the nurses was great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less meaningful compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn’t pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage them.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Memories**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past stunning sea views. No matter the weather or the season, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see beautiful gardens and homes of the wealthy. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking scenery.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many wonderful train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with an aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I had never been on a train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On that train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey itself was lovely, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unpredictable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train finally arrived, many people rushed to get on, even climbing onto the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains as children, but that’s not my story. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had carefully maintained. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Are you trying to get your story published? If you’re unsure where to send it, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" One important thing to remember is that you need to research your options and learn about publishers while also improving your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world. 

No matter what type of writing you do, it’s essential to know the markets you want to target. You can do this in several ways, but the best method is to read as much as you can about relevant topics. Visit your local library and explore nearby bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what types of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

As time passes, you should keep updating your knowledge because new publications are always emerging—editors change jobs, and magazines shift their focus. Publishers are always looking for fresh talent, so as writers, we must provide what they want. 

If you’re unsure about what to write, let’s say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories, as this market is quite limited today, and gather recent copies. Familiarize yourself with the types of stories they buy and understand their readers' expectations. The editor’s goal is to meet the needs of these readers.

Writers often ask me, ""This has been rejected three times—am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone, but it’s likely that the work isn’t ready for publication. Many new writers are too eager to submit their work before they are prepared. If you’ve only written one story or article, it’s very unlikely to be published. This rarely happens. When you hear about someone’s success, they often have years of experience in publishing or journalism behind them.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, keep writing while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will improve your skills, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your confidence. Instead of discarding any of your work, focus on improving it. 

I also recommend not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before achieving success. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby, or consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible.'"

On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I had expected. The usual bright and clean atmosphere of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had left their bags all over the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers one by one. He looked well-off: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn’t mind talking to her myself. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

""Well, I’m going north, yes,"" she replied. ""But to Philadelphia?"" 

""No, I’m going to New York, but I’ll be..."" 

""Thanks anyway,"" he said, moving on to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. ""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she replied, ""Wilmington,"" he didn’t say anything and continued down the row to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up from my pillar and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform as if I was focused on the train. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me, but I understood why he didn’t. I probably seemed unreliable to him. He glanced at me quickly and then turned to the other end of the waiting area. By now, he looked very stressed. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you’re going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five—older than me. She looked like a school teacher. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Then could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my left wrist (even though I didn’t own a watch). I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them like pets on leashes. 

Next, I heard the man speaking. ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do."" The woman nodded sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet and waited to see where this was going. 

""So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" It sounded suspicious! Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" This seemed like a weak excuse to me. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I glanced at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Be careful, lady, I thought silently."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, shares his story about his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef. John believes that everyone has a chance in life. For him, that chance was to run a restaurant, while Gary's chance was to cook. When John learned about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it, even though it was in poor condition. He thought it was perfect for his plans.

Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembered feeling sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. This made him want to ensure his family had time together. His wife took care of their children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made it a priority to have meals together. This focus on family helped their children, Gary and Joe, grow up confident. From a young age, they would talk to the restaurant's regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and accidentally knocked himself out. As he grew older, he earned pocket money by doing small jobs. By the age of ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he always had money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John enjoyed seeing Gary contribute.

Although Gary was not very good at school, he excelled in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John realized Gary had a talent for cooking. When Gary needed to do work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one goal at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told Gary that he needed to achieve his goals by the age of 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students struggled, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his tasks in just an hour. He even helped his classmates. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He has always taught Gary that hard work is essential because nothing is given for free. Gary recognized the opportunity he had and took full advantage of it.

As parents, we hope our children listen to us. If they remember even a small part of our advice, we should be grateful. John feels that Gary has listened and learned from him."
FCE_7,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was very difficult, like searching for gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections. If you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often helped. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no connections. No one could tell you about a vacant room. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For her, Dublin felt like a big unknown. She felt nervous as she took the train to start her new job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave. Who would want to stay in a small, remote town? For years, she heard her friends talk about escaping to experience life. Some of her classmates had moved to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm, as they are often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. However, Jo was unaware that they were still thinking about her as she responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her workplace and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.

There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about needing a ""Third Girl"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary—just a red-brick terraced house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. ""Desperate place,"" she told Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up. ""Hello,"" said the girl wearing a T-shirt with ""Nessa"" on it. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked.

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, looked like a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 

""I'm Jo, I work at the post office and called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa mentioned they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs—one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she offered kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of these animals.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, sensitive to human feelings, and inspire us with thoughts of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for them has been boosted by television shows. First, there was Flipper, and now we have Darwin from Seaquest. But these cheerful images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished waters.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by laws and cared for in marine reserves, but this is not happening. The lack of protection for dolphins could lead to one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.

There are forty different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out at sea and are rarely seen, while bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once frequently spotted near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, such as the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, indicated by skin injuries.

Understanding why dolphin numbers are decreasing is complicated. Overfishing is reducing fish populations, which threatens both local fishing industries and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not have enough time to find food elsewhere. They also risk getting caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing methods often use large nets that can trap dolphins. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall, with injuries showing that they were caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also accumulate harmful substances from the sea in their bodies. For example, pesticides can dissolve in fat, allowing dolphins to absorb them. Female dolphins then produce milk that contains these toxins, which can harm their young. There has been at least one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s contaminated milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.

Exercise improves your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries and improves specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Additionally, exercise benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can improve your sleep. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. If these reasons don’t motivate you, just remember that common sense tells us exercise is good for our health.

There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, and weight training. However, be careful not to overdo it, as training too hard can lead to injuries. Start slowly and consult your doctor if you’re unsure about what’s best for you.

Good posture is crucial for improving your body shape. Poor posture can make you look unattractive and feel low on energy, increasing the risk of minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head upward. This can help you lift your chest for better breathing and make your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It improves flexibility and helps you move easily, while preventing injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Stretching should be done slowly and carefully.

A good exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, an energetic workout, and cooling down afterward."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their comfortable homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, Amanda and Owen are some of the hardest to find. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost constant rain, leading to unexpected challenges. Newman mentioned that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their collaboration has produced some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a well-received film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.

This is common for traveling filmmakers, who have been exploring the world to capture exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we usually resolve them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they share a similar view of the animals. ""When we are on the move, we set up our tents each night. But now we are working from a more fixed camp. We leave at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so meal preparation can be stressful,"" Newman said. 

Their lifestyle can be tough, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman recalled filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often wander off. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions, and eventually, she included their vehicle in her greetings.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" Newman said, ""because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that resonates emotionally with viewers. I believe evoking an emotional response is much more powerful than just appealing to logic."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket parking lot. I was surprised by her choice of training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I’m so focused on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that’s it.""

Kendra explained, ""My entire life is about being at my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to achieve maximum fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only get one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become more difficult and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose."" But once the game is over, players become friends. 

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It’s essential for us to think and train like world-class players."" As captain, she believes it’s important to have a strong mindset and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""

Kendra explained, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned."" She decided some time ago that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears of joy, knowing her loyal supporters are with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel explains, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

If there is an emergency and they need to get to the surface quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. Although no one has tested it yet, Rachel thinks it would not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel recalls her first time in the vehicle. She climbed in on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a confined space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands. There, they found a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a multinational program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on 'black smokers,' another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke, pouring out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to find they were still alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She realizes that she is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on Earth has ever seen them before. After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone of voice, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believes being on time is very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, explains that candidates who take care of their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. While people often say that what matters is inside, it is important to present yourself well in an interview.

Many people overlook the importance of a professional image. For instance, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Body language and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% comes from our voice, and a surprising 55% comes from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also crucial not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview, leading to an immediate job offer. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. Once her boss sensed her enthusiasm, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can greatly affect the success of an interview. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can provide insights into the company's activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can show your genuine interest in the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions prepared and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She states, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and highlight key points."""

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many, but I excelled in football and athletics. At 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it did not attract much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to gain sponsorship, as training can be expensive. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s enjoyable because the facilities are excellent and the nightlife is fun. However, I must be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to qualify for the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it’s worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. The sacrifices pay off in the long run, as winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I suppose I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Being on a boat with five friends is always fun. We have a traditional way of celebrating our wins, and while some say we act a bit childish, we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so I enjoy returning home to hang out with friends from different backgrounds. It’s important to have a balance; you can’t focus solely on the sport all the time. I’m recognized in the sailing world, but I prefer not to be a celebrity. I receive many letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. At my last tournament, things got a bit hectic with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its challenges. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I received too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that contributed to our breakup. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you must be serious and professional. I’m focused on my game now and plan to enjoy other aspects of life after I retire, which comes relatively early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it's the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty for buying unhealthy items but also hates saying no all the time. This makes her feel frustrated before they even leave home. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but worries that she is not letting them learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are a key place where this advertising is effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when faced with appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, although these ideas may not always be correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, as children who only hear about products from TV ads get a very limited view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes that the main goal of advertising is to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they must decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but still feels uneasy about how she handles their requests. She has talked so much about advertisements that her son now thinks they are not trustworthy. As a result, they have less conflict in the supermarket because the children do not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, explains that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, while they themselves buy rich foods like double cream and chocolate. He finds it enjoyable to buy nice things and understands why children want to share in that. However, he admits that his mood affects his decisions; if he feels good, he is more likely to say yes, making it hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any lost sales."
FCE_20,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses, a project that took nearly two years and involved extensive research into what customers want. This approach allowed the hotel to install advanced technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to keep track of their preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will find the hotel particularly appealing, as MacCann estimates that about 65% of their business comes from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables and renting televisions, allowing for easy upgrades.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel features 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are inviting and cozy. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The dining experience is also exceptional. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who previously earned two Michelin stars for his restaurant in Dublin, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change allows him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant on-site is a great advantage without financial risks.

With its combination of advanced technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""For me, excitement is key. I need challenges and new things to learn to feel energized. I also get energy from rhythm; right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is expressive and uplifting. If I'm bored, I feel drained and like life has no purpose. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. Work is not a burden for me. Enjoying what I do helps me feel good, even when I'm tired. I need enough sleep to feel my best. When I only get six hours, I feel sluggish. Exercise boosts my energy, but I struggle to find the motivation to do it. I attend a yoga class weekly and try to work out at home. After exercising, my mood improves significantly. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't rely on healthy eating for energy; I think it's about having natural enthusiasm and a positive outlook. I dislike negativity. I believe we should enjoy life and seize the moment. Achieving goals is important, and I love my work. The last two years have been thrilling. I work with many energetic young people, which inspires me. I enjoy taking photos, even if I'm not great at it, and I love writing lyrics for fun during my travels.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and being positive in life. I enjoy working with children because they are full of energy and resilience. Energy is like a natural spark that comes from connecting with others—just smile at someone and see how great it feels when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is transforming a wasteland into a garden. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden by breaking up the concrete and adding soil. This gives me more energy than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also energizes me. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if caught, I playfully say I didn't know it was private. I find joy in that childlike adventure.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe it's important to have an interest in and respect for what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don't want to do drains my energy. I used to be part of several committees, but I found their demands exhausting. You have limited energy, so focus it on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron skates appeared in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the wealthy in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating very popular. Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is essential in skating, more than in many other sports. Start with your heels almost touching and your feet turned out. As you push off with your back foot, make a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you keep practicing, you can gradually make bigger movements as you improve.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed to reduce the impact with the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel and then stand up. Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle.

With proper instruction available at most ice rinks, you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you’ll be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle. If you watch skilled skaters, you’ll notice how relaxed and fluid their movements are. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise routine. Skating with a tense body can be risky, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent fitness program for overall health."

Seeing a talented child receive a medal can bring tears of joy. Julia Gregson spoke with three young achievers and their mothers about the joys and challenges they face.

A. **Annika Reeder, 15**: Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""Training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I’m extremely tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

B. **Annika's Mother**: ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen parents push their children, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika’s level requires a lot of time and energy, and she has to want it herself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from around the world and gained confidence through her success.""

C. **Sarah Stokes, 14**: Sarah started show-jumping at age ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents enjoy show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement and fun of show-jumping. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I’m determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team, and my big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's Mother**: ""From the moment Sarah first sat on a horse at age one, I knew she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is very organized and feels completely happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed in something they love is an incredible feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane, 10**: Jane is Britain’s Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should; I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant, and I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like feeling embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's Mother**: ""Jane played her first chess game at age five. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. I’m proud when she wins, but if she decided to quit tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to discourage her because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. We are starting to lose the effects of many generations of poor diets, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are beginning to reach our true potential. We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

Over the years, we have mostly eaten soups, porridges, and breads, which have left us undernourished. In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Some anthropologists believe corn was a public health disaster. 

Despite this, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland could support many more people than hunting and gathering. The issue of poor nutrition has only recently been addressed, even in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety our ancestors enjoyed. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. 

This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. While heights are increasing, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

Some experts, like Robert Fogel from the University, believe we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we may shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this question. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of television, yet many of us find them mysterious. When we see people getting excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are often seen as the least important type of audience. Some people in the television industry even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from various backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different kinds of people for different programs.

Many of us who prefer watching television at home cannot understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and endure hours of discomfort just to watch something they could see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on television for a moment. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason people attend is out of curiosity to see how things work behind the scenes. However, the most common reason I heard was simply, ""a friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it’s like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond accordingly. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We always believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed the feeling of being part of live television. Charlotte mentioned seeing her favorite comedian live, saying that watching at home misses a lot of the experience. I found that from my seat, I could only see the back of someone’s head, and I ended up watching the show on a monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters most. For many in the audience, it was simply a fun and free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I do not enjoy landscapes that are completely wild. I find the human aspect important. This is also true when I travel abroad. I am drawn to charming villages with old temples, rather than empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham, located in a beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape from school. I loved exploring the bare hilltops, sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary, which was my first attempt at travel writing, a field in which I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by enthusiasts. I always choose first class because it is only slightly more expensive than the regular ticket. The scenery is not breathtaking. The train travels across Romney Marsh, where sheep graze, and alongside a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers get a glimpse into people's lives as they make tea, wash dishes, or set up deck chairs. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It is the simplicity of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me look more closely, searching for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coastline. The beaches are hard to access and filled with rocks, so there are not many crowds here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to admire the power of the sea. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many residents or visitors, making it a quiet and remote area, which I enjoy. I discovered this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits even more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is the house of my dreams. It is a magical, secluded, romantic place. You can only hear the sea, the wind, and the birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals of all kinds. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had prepared a special tank for such visitors, allowing us to admire them and look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their room. The chaos involved our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca, which I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the children’s flailing arms.

In the midst of the confusion, I tripped and fell. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake approached, while the kids and the cat jumped around in a wild, noisy mess. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. 

I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, this same mouse was caught by Domino three more times during its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged by my success with the cat, I examined the snake for any weaknesses, but it had none. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, but without music. Gradually, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked wary. 

I carefully slid my hands under the snake and stood up, walking to the end of the garden. I pointed the snake towards a tree, hoping it would find a good home. When I finally let go of its head, expecting it to bite me, it instead slithered over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter. 

As dusk fell, my four children, the snake, and I stood together. My eldest, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" I had the children gently encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, three-year-old Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

""Send me a message! In our fast-paced world of phones, faxes, and computers, the traditional practice of writing letters is in danger of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter brings a special joy that no other form of communication can match. There is the thrill of its arrival, the joy of seeing who sent it, and the pleasure of reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back to me. Sometimes my father would write, and I loved receiving his long, funny letters. Most of the letters from home shared everyday news about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. In my younger days, I often met people who had to work or study far away, and we kept in touch through letters. Instead of hurting our relationships, writing letters seemed to make them stronger. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than in conversation.

I enjoy the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a whole year’s worth of news! It’s especially exciting when the letter comes in an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. I receive letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There’s also a woman who writes to me from France. If we hadn’t started talking in a restaurant on our way home from vacation, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a wonderful friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her (she doesn’t speak English), and we have visited each other’s homes.

My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our friendship lasted so long. The local newspaper even thought it was newsworthy enough to feature on the front page.

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did for my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."""
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain, which was once a place for prayer and worship, has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include images of cows, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being harmed by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer,"" he explains. ""The drawings are naturally polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the entire mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees with this strict approach. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is the most severe, and while it may be effective, it will likely cause protests from local residents. The site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture years ago, and we must do everything we can to protect it.""

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also prefers not to close the site. He states, ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal. Our department believes the best solution is to allow people to see the site, but because it is so large, it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage. I would like everyone to be able to visit, but the main issue is funding. We do not have enough money to hire the necessary number of guards. We may need to consider charging an entrance fee, as there seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to access—tourists can now avoid a three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to cordon off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she argues. ""That is not acceptable. Funding must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing these drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" Her children want everything they see, whether it’s the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty about buying unhealthy items but also hates saying no all the time. This makes her feel frustrated before they even leave home. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but worries that she is not letting them learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are a key place where this advertising is effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when faced with appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, although these ideas may not always be correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, as children who only hear about products from TV ads get a very limited view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes that the main goal of advertising is to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they must decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but still feels uneasy about how she handles their shopping requests. She has talked so much about advertisements that her son now thinks they are not trustworthy. As a result, they have less conflict in the supermarket because the children do not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also recognize that they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, explains that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, while they themselves buy rich foods like cream and chocolate. He finds it reasonable for children to want nice things, but he still feels annoyed by their requests. His mood affects his decisions; when he feels good, he is more likely to say yes, making it hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any lost sales."
FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

In the past, climbers would go to the mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. A crowd watches in excitement as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. The ability to hold such events is thanks to new and rapidly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. Since they couldn’t use cliffs for much of the year, they started climbing on brick edges or stone buildings to keep their skills sharp and avoid boredom.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls specifically for training. These walls were made with special bricks that climbers could grip. One of the first climbing walls was created by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He came up with the idea of embedding natural rock into concrete blocks to create climbing walls. Throughout the 1970s, many similar walls were built in sports halls across the country, but they had some design issues. These walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once built, the walls couldn’t be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes, no matter how many different holds they tried.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a new material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to create climbing panels on steel frames. Unlike concrete, which was too heavy for overhanging walls, steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"Text: 'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone about your desire to become an actor, they will likely mention that it is a risky career. Acting is indeed risky because there are more actors than available roles. When you decide to pursue acting, some people you thought were your friends may think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will have different opinions, but this is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own path and dreams. There are no easy shortcuts to success in acting; there are no exams to pass, and completing training does not guarantee you will find work. Success depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and the profession can offer excitement, glamour, and sometimes financial rewards.

Many people ask what talent is. I believe talent is a combination of natural ability and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves courage and confidence in what you are doing. The desire to act can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform.

When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often do not have a clear answer. They understand their own skills and techniques but do not take anything for granted. They know that their success depends on their current work, and fame can be fleeting. Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. One month you might be unemployed, doing other jobs, and the next month you could be auditioning for a role. Even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection, which is something everyone dislikes. From the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are available and hopefully talented enough for the role. Ultimately, it is up to you; if you do not care enough about your career, others may not care about you either.'"

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago. 

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

Research in Ohio showed that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a blessing, some anthropologists see it as a public health disaster. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of farmland can support many more people than hunting and gathering could. 

Recently, even wealthier nations have started to address poor nutrition. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are becoming more like those of our ancestors. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Despite taller heights, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing companies are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? Some experts, like Robert Fogel, believe we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. 

However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even with good nutrition. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt was once an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He worked in the City for 14 years, but it became less enjoyable. He didn’t plan to leave his job yet, but he was unexpectedly made redundant. Although he didn’t receive a large severance package, it was enough to start his farm. His big opportunity came when he met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying meat to them, his reputation grew, and now he also sells meat online. He is happy to be out of the office, but he still works long hours, around 80 to 90 a week, and continues to sell a product.

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White used to manage an advertising company, but now he is an artist. Painting started as a hobby, but he found it more exciting than his job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right choice. A career counselor he spoke to was surprised when Ron said he didn’t want to return to his old job. Most people in their forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. Ron and his wife had married young, and their children were independent, allowing him to take this risk. They moved to northern England, where they didn’t know anyone. Although they left their friends behind, many have visited them since.

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business from her flat in London. She enjoyed her job as a lawyer and earned a good salary, but the long hours were exhausting. She realized she didn’t want to become a senior partner, so she decided to leave. Many people thought she would get bored, but that hasn’t happened. She keeps busy with deadlines related to fashion, such as collections and seasonal designs. She feels happier and less stressed now, but she misses the social interaction with colleagues. What she loves about her new job is being fully responsible for her work. If she does a poor job, she is the one who faces the consequences. While she cared about her work in a company, she feels even more invested when her name is on the promotional materials.

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater spent 16 years in finance before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in financial markets at 22, enjoying the excitement but not finding the work fulfilling. He almost lost his job in 1989 but chose to resign and travel for a year instead. During that time, he explored what he wanted to do. Interested in health, he visited top gyms and spoke with their owners about starting a business. Knowing he needed qualifications to change careers, he took various massage courses. Eventually, he got part-time work at the Life Centre. He has no regrets about his decision. He feels more in control of his life now and enjoys the peace of mind that comes with it."
FCE_5,"**A Winning Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, enjoying their past. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, an ancient game they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played together, and as Dave says, ""we had the best time ever."" 

Later, the family moved to New Mexico, but they kept playing with their grandfather's pichenotte board, made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed how worn the old board was and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative wanted one, then a friend asked for another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People watched and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon, they couldn't get up from the table!"" 

When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched it. He found that the game likely started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This evolved into 'squails,' played in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. The game can be played by two to four people and requires skill. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks,' which they flick across a wheel-like board using their fingers. Scoring 20 points is achieved by getting a puck into a small hole, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. A game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity increased. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, leading the brothers to start a pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have produced over 450 boards. Made from birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12 kg and is 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable and can handle a lot of use."" They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage, but the brothers believe it won't be long before their garage is home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. For now, they enjoy their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE

When you enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was an empty, overgrown piece of land. For a long time, it was seen as useless. However, through careful planning and hard work by one man, with the support of his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful village you see today. 

During the construction, many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the lovely landscape you see now. While machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of manual labor was also involved. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, chosen carefully to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who spent nine years creating over 100 models after the village opened in 1972. These models are made from various materials—stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—to endure different weather conditions. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how materials would last over time, but he quickly became skilled himself. 

You will notice that a consistent scale has been maintained, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details of the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and upkeep. The methods used here have inspired other model villages in England and have even been included in college courses on modeling.

All the buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place. One of the most impressive structures is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, reflecting the style of manor houses found in the West Country. As you explore the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

We kindly ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can lead to hours of repair work for us. You are welcome to take photos from the pathways only, and dogs are allowed on a short lead.

To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these will make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we would appreciate your feedback. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more diverse and interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations, as we are constantly updating and replacing them.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of conduct. While some pop stars do pose for photographers occasionally, this is not the norm. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to address such problems. Rarely are these pictures in the public's interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-distance photos, and since she was in a hotel—a place where people expect privacy—she had a valid reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is scandalous that the PCC did not start an investigation. It should also look into the recent inappropriate story about a pop star's romantic life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on this and other unacceptable invasions of privacy?

At first glance, this seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and covered on TV and radio. The public would likely not support such behavior, forcing editors to stop publishing this type of content. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide and take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC took on the role of a ""police officer,"" there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to investigate? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to file a complaint? And if the person still refused to act, should the PCC proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and they could be upset if it wasn't. 

Moreover, the task is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy has been violated, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Many might prefer to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet, such as fearing that a worse story about them could come to light if they complain. In this case, the PCC might seem like an enemy. 

One British comedian faced similar issues when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. His reason was the fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find a simple solution to this serious problem."

We will not discuss those looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those who leave a job they dislike within a few weeks. Instead, we will talk about those of you who are ready to take a significant step in your career. You have gained some experience and skills and have a clearer idea of your career goals.

What kind of job should you seek? It largely depends on your long-term goals. Ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher responsibilities, or explore a broader field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully, as you should plan to stay in it for two to three years. Future employers will closely examine this job when you apply for your next position. It should demonstrate that you have thought seriously about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow, develop your skills, and increase your responsibilities.

If you feel the urge to travel, now might be a good time to do so. You can take temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are less likely to leave again.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after graduating from St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors.

FCE_17,"**Text: 'What is the Secret of Confident People?**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but many will say it is a skill they learned out of necessity. Nina Hathway interviews five individuals to discover how they gained their confidence.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At around twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was nervous but surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I felt very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was a turning point in my life that helped everything else improve.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became overly aggressive and impatient, thinking that was how confident people acted. Eventually, I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work becomes too overwhelming, I don’t feel guilty about postponing some tasks. When facing challenges, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can undermine confidence, so I often have quiet conversations with myself to overcome those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as very confident, but the calmer I appear, the more scared I actually feel. I had to learn to look confident because it is crucial in my job in TV. Interviewing people has shown me that most of us feel tense in important situations, but we relax when talking to someone friendly. The best advice I received was from my mother when I worried about my appearance as a teenager. She said, ""Who’s looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves."" I find this very helpful. I also believe that facing your fears helps build confidence. I was nervous during my driving test, but after passing, I felt I could handle anything.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am well-liked in the restaurant, but I know that not everyone will like me. I don’t let that bother me. It’s important to accept yourself and not try to meet others' expectations. My company offers many training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. They also encourage us to set realistic goals. It is very helpful to see your achievements rather than aiming too high and feeling disappointed.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings, afraid to speak up even when I disagreed. Eventually, I found the courage to share my thoughts. When I first entered politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, ""Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too."" I also found it helpful to write down a few notes to refer to, like a comfort blanket. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking publicly. The real secret to confidence is reminding yourself repeatedly, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's a tradition—if the line breaks, the finders keep it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a line of tense competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites shot into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 

""Flying kites isn't too hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how."" I had received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he invited me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A narrow boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before starting, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and thousands of creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being washed away (which sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I will always remember it for the kindness of its people."

Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer various questions about them. The quiz sheets can be picked up from 25 March to 9 April during regular gallery hours.

**New Artwork**  
The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch painter Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for specific flowers to bloom in different seasons. This artwork was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is currently displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition titled ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this time: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until 31 May.

**Lecture Series**  
The series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will talk about Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will focus on Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often tell stories through their paintings.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery is pleased to announce that the restaurant has improved and expanded its services. With new kitchens, the restaurant now offers a wide variety of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Visitor Information**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery are available every day at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (except Sundays). These tours highlight some of the Gallery's greatest artworks and showcase its collection of important European paintings from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."
PET_24,"**Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometer. The key difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted.

Over time, most societies created their own forms of money, known as 'currencies,' to make trading easier. Eventually, different currencies began to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."
PET_46,"**Write a Winning Story!**

You have a chance to win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other winners will receive £100 each. We are looking for people who can write great stories. The judges include novelist Mary Littlejohn, television reporter Michael Brown, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, many successful stories were about love, family, and friendship problems. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so that readers want to keep reading.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your descriptions and information are accurate. Don’t write about something unless you are sure about it.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an engaging way and end it with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your plot carefully and think of something unexpected for the conclusion.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using descriptive language. Help the reader connect with them.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a new rule. Your story must not have been published in any form, including on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. 

The entry fee is £5, which goes to the Writers' Association. Please make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with your application form and story to us. The closing date is July 30, and we will notify the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have any of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created several scientific tools to assist her work. During her time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 types of grass, and they can be found in every part of the earth. Grass is unique because it can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way.

One of the remarkable features of grass is its ability to recover quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike many other plants, grass grows new leaves from below the soil rather than from the top. This allows many animals to live together in the same area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh food source."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion. She recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream to make fashion her career. She believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.

After finishing her studies, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. Although she had to attend many industry events, she could not afford the designer clothes she admired. To solve this, she began making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends noticed her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. 

Kal then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes became very popular, and nothing was returned. This success motivated her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. 

Her parents were supportive of her decision to change careers, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels grateful for her journey, saying, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has provided excellent service to guests from around the world, welcoming people of all ages and nationalities. Over the past 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed at Sunningdale.

The hotel is located on a main road that leads to the town center. It is about a 20-minute bus ride from the center, and buses to various parts of the town stop right outside the hotel. Guests should avoid buses with a blue ""Express"" sign, as they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 well-furnished, centrally heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are located at the end of each corridor. The hotel also features a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are eight pianos available for guests to use. Parking spaces for cars are available in the hotel driveway. Daily newspapers are provided for free, and stamps can be purchased at the office.

Guests staying for long periods must pay for their accommodation weekly in advance and give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests are given priority for rooms.

Meal times are as follows: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm.

PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway took a train journey from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train travels across Australia, from the warm northern coast through vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late.

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s, with a line reaching Alice Springs. However, flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just before my trip. The railway was designed for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. Unlike luxury trains like the Orient Express, the Ghan does not focus on luxury, but the food on board is very good. The railway was originally built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to southern Australia via Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent.

It is rare to complete a transcontinental railway, and the Ghan claims to be the first north-south railway in the world. As I waited to board, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Many of my fellow travelers were Australian retirees who were especially eager to get on the train. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip in the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop their journey there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very exciting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. However, on the third day at dawn, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was coming to an end, and although the train did not meet all the expectations from the advertisements, it had taken me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high, making it one of the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowl-shaped areas cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are necessary because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. 

Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, we still felt nervous when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult.

As we climbed, the path became steeper, and my legs felt heavy. Being the least experienced climber, I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes paused to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start climbing again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. This path is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops steeply on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. Unfortunately, we were not lucky that day, as a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as challenging as climbing up. You need to be able to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we took turns reading the map. It was only when I was safely in the tent that I could say I truly enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, similar to our old school, but this one is designed to be environmentally friendly. The construction took several months, and we watched it progress. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant losing some beautiful open space. The noise from the construction machines was quite loud, and the builders often had to stop working due to heavy rain. At times, we worried that the building would never be completed.

Now, we have five large classrooms, much bigger than those in our old school, which was very old. We also share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a lovely dining room, and spacious changing rooms that we are eager to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the students, teachers, and the computers we use. The building is designed to keep the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof, as it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for our lights and computers comes from a wind turbine located on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very quickly. It is so large that it can be seen from miles away! We took some pictures that we plan to share on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. However, the new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place we stayed wasn't great, but it had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. 

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn were with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn’t know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren’t sure how. Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went caving first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally made it out—covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had accomplished.'"
PET_23,"Letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday afternoon, I accidentally left my handbag on the bus. Inside were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized my mistake, it was too late. I felt lost: I am 72 years old, far from home, and quite worried. I stood by the road and cried. 

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what had happened, and he kindly gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he told me I could keep the fare. I made it home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that operated the bus where I left my handbag. He informed me that they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. 

I was amazed to get my handbag back, with everything inside still there. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me that day. Their kindness and honesty meant a lot to me.

PET_60,"Sharks

Sharks are among the most intimidating animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous to smaller sea animals that they prey on. 

While sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are quite different. For instance, most sharks must keep swimming constantly to breathe and survive, which means they hardly ever sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can become completely still. This is a useful method for researchers who need to study sharks, as it helps them learn more about these intriguing animals."

PET_53,"Text: 'Joining the Kirov Ballet

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they switched to English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I can understand my teachers.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mother stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I was feeling lonely. The classes in Russia are much harder than those at my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence to meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was extremely cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the locals said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to experience the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, it was decided that the dark and cold winter could be seen as a positive thing. 

In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a structure made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous worldwide.

As winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to construct the hotel for that year. As each section is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first section is completed in December, and each week after that, a new section opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date depends on the weather, so plans can change.

In spring, as the weather warms up, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing, such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves, as part of their stay. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose shoes that are slightly larger than usual to fit thick socks.

If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items along with your booking, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture store, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store. There were many special deals, like a leather sofa for £45 (available only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The store's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close just half an hour after opening.

A police officer who was called to the store said, ""We knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly for their turn. Another issue was that there was a long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. I was shocked that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store, which blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were very calm and explained the situation. They had no choice; it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had previously dived deeper, she used a balloon to help her come back up then. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the only woman in any sport to break a man's world record.

A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. After several serious accidents involving other divers, some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous. However, Tanya disagrees, emphasizing that safety is the most important factor, followed closely by training.

Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya maintains a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done at the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to prevent knee injuries. Instead, she finds that fast walking is an effective way to stay fit.

When preparing for practice dives, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive. It is crucial for her to avoid fatigue, as it could jeopardize her preparation.

When not training for events, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects and films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. Tanya believes her life now reflects her childhood dreams. Because she is well-known in some countries, she feels people listen to her when she discusses environmental issues.

Looking to the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she started free-diving at the age of twenty-five, she is eager to emphasize that she does not plan to retire from the sport for many years."
PET_12,"CARTOON FILMS

Cartoon films have very few restrictions. If you can draw something, you can animate it for the cinema. New ideas and advanced computer technology are making cartoons exciting for people of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry believed that cartoons were only for children. However, soon after, a few directors introduced original ideas. They showed that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Not every cartoon film was a success, though. For instance, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this experience, and film companies started to earn significant profits again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson discusses her first role on television. ""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to adapt the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to audition for the role. At first, my mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. The outdoor filming began a week after the term started, so I asked the university for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was exciting. It was an incredible experience, and I feel very lucky. After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I don’t come from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I have auditioned for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I felt a bit lost. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I’m going to Greece for the summer with friends."""
PET_8,"When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, my main goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a fast-growing international company. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is shared in this book. I believe our company has valuable insights on how to run a successful business while staying true to our beliefs. 

This is not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The main message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can make a positive impact. In both business and life, I want to feel happy, have a sense of family, and be excited by surprises. I have always wanted the people who work at 'The Body Shop' to share these feelings. 

Now, this book spreads my ideas to the world and makes them known. I hope to inspire a sense of limitless possibilities within our 'family' and in what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."
PET_4,"**A Journey Along the Beautiful Douro River**

Jules Verne operates a 'hotel ship' on the Douro River in Portugal. The MV Lady Ivy May can accommodate 160 guests in double cabins, all with outside views and private bathrooms. On the ship, which has air conditioning, you will find a sun deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop, and library.

**Itinerary**

**Day 1:** Depart in the early evening from London Heathrow to Oporto. A guide will meet you upon arrival and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.

**Day 2:** After a morning of sightseeing in Oporto, you will return to the ship and set off for Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey takes four hours.

**Day 3:** You will continue your journey up the river. In the early evening, the ship will stop at Peso da Regua, known for its port wine production. At dinner, you can enjoy delicious local food and drink.

**Day 4:** After breakfast, you will travel south by bus to the ancient town of Lamego. You will visit the cathedral, several churches, and a museum that was once a palace, now home to a great collection of paintings, tapestries, and sculptures. Afterward, you will return to the ship and sail to Tua.

**Day 5:** The Douro River becomes very narrow here. Depending on the river's depth, you may take a smaller boat to the Spanish border at Barca d'Alva. The return journey to Tua will be by coach, with many sights to see along the way.

**Day 6:** In the morning, you will drive to Sao Joao da Pesqueira for one of the best views in the Douro Valley. After lunch on the ship, you will take the Douro Valley railway for a scenic ride through the countryside to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be waiting for you.

**Day 7:** You will visit Vila Real before returning to the ship for lunch and then heading down the river to Oporto. You will spend the night on board the Lady Ivy May.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with plenty of time for sightseeing and last-minute shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilogram of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder taste than darker honey.

In ancient times, honey was the main source of sweetness because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and enhance athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used to soothe sore throats and is included in many skin and hair care products."
PET_7,"**Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a significant center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it received a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. For the next 300 years, it continued to grow and prosper, becoming known for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. The city has a growing student population and is a modern commercial center, being the largest hub for insurance services outside London. 

Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and several arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear. 

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich dealt with a large construction site in the city center as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with water features and many trees. Fortunately, the old open market remains in the heart of the city, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich successfully combines its rich history with modern growth."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to participate at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The balloon pilots communicate with each other via radio and light up their burners at the same time, creating a beautiful display known as ""balloon glows."" These moments are great for taking amazing photographs, but you need to arrive just after sunset or before 5:30 AM to see them as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, and even popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will enjoy this experience.

In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies offering flights. Another option is to ride the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a stunning view of the festival.

There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for ballooning. The Sandia Mountains shield the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival. Wear several layers of light clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are necessary. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film, make sure to have high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."
PET_51,"The Eden Project

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the most popular tourist spots in the UK. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction film. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, demonstrating the important connection between people and plants. It is fascinating to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. More than 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled heaters maintain the right temperature for the plants. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid due to a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environments of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone soon."
PET_11,"Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I don't understand why. After all, 500 pages of original writing for £6.99 is quite impressive, isn't it? The majority of the book consists of fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable works by well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have focused on food in their pieces. I recommend avoiding Jane Harris's Those Nails right after meals, as it contains some very disturbing scenes that might upset you! The collection also features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Additionally, there are excerpts from novels still being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a small amount of non-fiction, including a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and a remarkable piece by Ursula Owen about her own life. Overall, this is an outstanding collection, and I am eager to see what next year's edition will bring."
PET_14,"**The Best Age to Start Learning the Violin**

Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher, believes that the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. She explains that this is when children are discovering the world around them. Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she has made exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds.

When she began teaching in 1972, her first class included her children’s five-year-old friends. Margaret teaches in groups, with about twelve students in each class. Each lesson lasts one hour and takes place every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her each week. It is also important for parents to attend the classes, as their involvement is crucial for the students' learning.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play music by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a noticeable difference between how well they play and their ability to read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not designed to create expert violinists. She often advises students who excel to leave and pursue more traditional methods of violin study."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to their previous album, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott has joined as the new bass guitarist, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Additionally, Tom Simpson is now playing the drums.

From the first song, which is a dance track, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and more energetic. Most of the later songs return to the band's usual slower style. These two dance tracks may surprise many fans, but either could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford showcases his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should appreciate that he recorded these songs before experiencing throat issues, which led to the cancellation of their upcoming tour. However, anyone who has bought tickets need not worry, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.

In this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in different styles, from the slow songs we know to the upbeat tracks that make you want to dance. I felt that their best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Nevertheless, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big success and will bring more recognition to the band."
PET_36,"San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, San Francisco Bay, a beautiful natural harbor, was discovered by land instead of by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest individuals were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill known as Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous sites like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the former prison."

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It provides a detailed and interesting account of daily life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys discusses significant events of the time, such as diseases, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his own flaws—like often falling asleep in church or admiring pretty girls. He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they made up, as well as his concerns about her health. In addition to reading, he enjoyed music, theater, card games, and lively parties with good food. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles; he served as a Member of Parliament and was the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not focus on making shoes comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which were tied around the ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. 

Originally, all shoes were handmade, but now most are produced by machines in large factories, although some traditional shoemakers still exist. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to create many more shoes at lower prices, making them available to more people."
PET_20,"**No Title**

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to encourage more women to join the sport, to show them how enjoyable it can be, and to help them feel confident about running. I decided to start a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with how some race organizers think. They often complain about the low number of women in running, but they also use this as a reason not to provide separate changing rooms.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't think about the fun of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about healthy eating and staying fit from other runners. I wanted to support women's running, and it has been a joy to see their progress—almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this problem, a winter trail was created in 1910 for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothing to gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced dog teams and boats as the main transport. However, in 1925, the dogs gained fame again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The medicine needed to cure the disease was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. At that time, airplanes were new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in the cold weather. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away on a trip. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine instead.

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty dog teams completed the trip in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo, who skillfully guided him through the heavy snow. The last part of the journey was led by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years, with his lead dog Saito. At one point, Balto, another lead dog, refused to go further and saved the team from falling into icy water. Thanks to their efforts, the diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."
PET_45,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite this extreme cold, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to experience one of Europe’s most unique hotels. In this hotel, everything is made of ice, including the rooms where guests eat, drink, and sleep. You can even have a wedding there. The bar is also made of ice, so it is not a good idea to place hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags that keep them warm in such cold conditions. If needed, suitable outdoor clothing can also be provided. The hotel lasts for only six months because it melts in the summer, and every winter, it is rebuilt. Constructing the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."
PET_29,"**Maria Mutola**

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized she was very fast. 

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help improve their financial situation. They agreed to let him take her away to train.

In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had previously refused because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She explained, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother."

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and, most importantly, enjoy the stunning views. One of the highlights is the Skywalk. This platform is 1,219 meters above the canyon floor and is made of glass, allowing visitors to see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on the Skywalk at the same time. It opened in 2007, and since then, thousands have experienced it. Visitors must wear special shoe covers to protect the glass surface. Walking on the Skywalk gives you the feeling of soaring like a bird high in the sky."

The Rocky Mountains stretch nearly the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest but are also found a few hundred miles from the center in southern regions. While the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are equally impressive. There are many roads that cross the Rockies, but the best way to experience them is by train. 

You can start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful cities. This city is located by the water and near the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver daily for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the journey remains an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you will see some of the most stunning views at night."
PET_42,"**ZOOS**

People have been keeping animals in zoos for over 3,000 years, starting with a large zoo in China called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals were trained to perform for visitors, but this practice has stopped. Now, the main goal of zoos is to allow people to observe animals in their natural behaviors. Most cities today have a zoo or wildlife park.

However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters argue that zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, experiences that would be difficult without them. Conversely, critics believe it is wrong to confine animals in cages. They argue that poorly managed zoos can lead to animals living in unsanitary conditions and being fed inappropriate diets."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all experienced in competitions, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially for our age. Musicians from each band even made up new songs right on stage. It was thrilling to watch, but even more exciting when my band performed!  

Our school has a fantastic jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often hang out after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps around the country. I have attended a few and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music while also feeling connected to its history, as you perform like the great jazz artists before you.  

Our school is fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn’t make progress in our music!"
PET_54,"**Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is rare, and when it does occur, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden influx, causing the streets to flood. Despite the recent dry winters, the local people welcome the rain when it arrives. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they are sustained by a system of underground channels built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains throughout the year. Areas that receive water in this way are called oases.

Traveling south from Marrakesh, one reaches Skoura, where every piece of land is divided into small plots by water channels for growing food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter create a beautiful backdrop."
PET_32,"**Gareth Ellis**

Gareth Ellis, 13 years old, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always dreamed of being a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. 

""People laugh when we tell them,"" says Kath. ""But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found work with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and return home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away.

""I can't say it was easy,"" says Kath. ""There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving our nice house behind. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""

""People ask about my education,"" says Gareth, ""but from the start, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I use the same books as everyone back at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates.""

And what about the future? ""It was a tough decision,"" says Kath, ""but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day,"" he says, ""maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to important newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and participate in projects. We plan to open more centers nationwide. Since our agency began in 1994, originally called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined. Sophie is one of them. She says, ""I first learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities available to young journalists. Age didn’t matter; we were trusted to work on stories independently. I started attending the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and remained a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I gained, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, where I check articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen promotes skill-sharing among members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members in basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often at youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff during these events.

Eight-eighteen News offers training sessions for new members three times a year. The next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, please call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here, you will find all the information you need before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. These flights take you over Antarctica and back. The exact dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to a different date if necessary.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the journey, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is also a camera next to the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit throughout the flight.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot will fly in long 'figure 8s' to ensure everyone can see the sights from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain will check the satellite images of the clouds and choose the route that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Absolutely! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothing."
PET_35,"**Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But now, I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Driving in winter can be dangerous because conditions can change quickly, leading to accidents. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill, and ice may be hidden under melting snow, making the road slippery. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Think of driving as if you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you; you want to drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to stay alert to potential dangers. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Practice how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Be aware that you might be driving faster than you realize. Generally, allow double your usual stopping distance on wet roads, three times that on snow, and even more on ice. Always try to keep control of your car to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law but ended up going to art school instead. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art, which sparked his interest in early Italian artists. This influence can be seen in some of his paintings. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his work. 

To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark, but he admits he never knows how the final result will turn out. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start with yellow, knowing what I will put on top."" Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it seem easy. He believes anyone can use colors since they can be bought. He simply pays attention to how colors look next to each other.

Unlike some artists, Aitchison does not make sketches before starting a painting. He feels that if he did, he might lose interest and not complete the painting. Instead, he often changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, Aitchison has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any artistic tradition; he simply paints in his own way. Nevertheless, his work continues to inspire young British painters."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" Eventually, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit unusual, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical talent—after all, I didn't expect my parents to enjoy the same music I liked as a teenager—but they do perform regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but that hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. It offers students valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to prepare for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from various countries, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in helpful activities, such as working on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best aspects of Atlantic College is its diverse student body, which includes individuals from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the tuition fees are £20,000 for two years, financial aid is available. About 25% of the students are British, many of whom can only attend because they receive government support.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education through effective methods."
PET_47,"**Being an Older Student**

At 32 years old, I have just completed my first year at university. In addition to attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not require much thinking. This made me increasingly unhappy, as I felt trapped in my job. I envied the students at the local university, who seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

Now that I am a student, I find it challenging to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is essential for getting a fulfilling job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. Additionally, I enjoy the typical student benefits, such as long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas. I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life is a wise decision."
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born in 1863 on a farm in Michigan, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic, and in 1893, he created his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet lightweight steel, he produced affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. He quickly began selling 100 cars each day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_19,"**Rebecca Stevens**

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small apartment in south London. In 1993, Rebecca decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with a group of climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very challenging. 

""You have to carry everything on your back,"" she said. ""This means you can only bring what you really need. There is no way to wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn’t even take a toothbrush. I usually like to stay clean, but there is no water, just snow. Water is heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the happiest moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. She has since written a book about her journey, and people often invite her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. 

Today, Rebecca is well-known and has more money, but she still lives in her small apartment in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains!"

KET_13,"**CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds would not survive if they stayed there. 

Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know how to migrate in the autumn."" He owned a small plane and decided to teach the geese to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him.

When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home.

This spring, Bill waited for the geese to come back, but they did not arrive. So, he flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way home on their own!"
KET_16,"**ESTHER'S STORY**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 per jar to her friends and quickly earned back her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not supportive of her decision. They wanted her to focus on studying and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling her jam at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where a friend worked.

After two years, her business grew significantly, and her parents were proud of her. She produced various types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some employees to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens, selling milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to keep them cool.

Five years ago, Jenny tried to sell sweaters made from the wool at country markets, but it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which became very popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. This is how Jenny's business began.

Initially, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers. To keep up with demand, she started sending the wool to a factory, where machines now produce all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and various types of socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers.

Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. Her office walls are filled with letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"**BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON**

Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave their homes and forget to close a door or window. 

Inspector Saunders noted that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are ideal for burglars since it gets dark, making it harder for them to be seen. Many houses are also empty during this time because people are still at work.

He suggested that it is wise to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday, as this can deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when someone is away and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious. 

""We can also provide advice on how to make your home safer,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This assistance is free of charge."""

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming began, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These individuals were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, leading to the growth of larger villages. As a result, some villagers could focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming could be challenging during bad weather, which sometimes left people without enough food. Today, farmers can produce more food, which can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes."
KET_22,"**WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE**

Nicola Peet left school at eighteen, attended college, and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she began working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later joined British Airways as a flight attendant. Four years later, she became a manager. Here is what she shared about her job:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time flying. I train flight attendants and assist them with any issues. I also attend many meetings. My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check flight schedules on my computer, and then I talk to some of the flight attendants. Occasionally, I take long flights to see how the flight attendants are performing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, all I want to do is eat something and then go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""

KET_62,"The Weather People study the weather for many reasons, and it is important for various professions. For instance, weather significantly affects farmers. In the past, farmers spent a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Today, we have many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even access weather information on their mobile phones. However, many people still hold onto traditional beliefs about the weather. For example, some say that a red sky in the evening means it will be sunny the next day. Others believe that if cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small town in Canada. They have been friends and classmates for a long time. Like their other friends, they usually enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework; instead, they have created a new computer word game.

The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who struggles with reading. Kevin finds it easier to learn words by seeing pictures and hearing sounds rather than by reading text. Frazer wanted to help his brother, so he and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to develop the game, which is now ready to use.

The game combines speaking and pictures. For instance, when you see the word ""hat,"" there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying ""Hat! Hat!"" at the same time. The boys have received many awards for their game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in purchasing it."
KET_31,"**How Does the Irish Pop Group 'Boyzone' Live a Healthy Life?**

Getting enough sleep is very important. When I return to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, after a concert, I find it hard to sleep because my mind is filled with music. 

Sports are also important. Before my car accident, I spent two and a half hours at the sports center five days a week. Now, I cannot do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups each day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat healthily. I also drink a lot of water because it is good for my health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I do not always manage that.

People should not work all the time. I enjoy my job, but I also have other interests. In my free time, I like to listen to music or watch TV. It is beneficial to relax sometimes. Since the doctor advised me to eat better, I no longer feel tired. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day, but I still enjoy burgers occasionally!"
KET_58,"**Bollywood**

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, far surpassing the USA. Many Indians prefer watching films to any other leisure activity, with ten million people visiting cinemas daily. 

Bollywood films often focus on romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are essential elements in every movie. These films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. 

Indian actors produce more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films have a production cost of about $2 million, while Hollywood films typically cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers usually last only a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, often regarded as India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career spanning almost 40 years."
KET_37,"Bill Bryson

I was born in the United States, but I have written many travel books about England. I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years. For the last three years, we have been back in the United States. Our children are now learning about life here, and I believe they will be happier because they have experienced living in two countries. I enjoy Britain and want to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is starting college here soon, so it will be another four years before we go back.

Recently, I spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to discuss my new book. Most writers do not enjoy this kind of travel to promote their books, but I do. I like visiting new places and meeting many people. This experience is very different from my writing life in the United States. In England, I was driven around in large cars and stayed in nice hotels. It was great because I did not have to pay for anything. Everyone was very kind to me, and I had a lot of fun."
KET_2,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes arrived in England more than 50 years ago, while the Giant Schnauzer is a more recent addition. The name ""Giant"" is fitting because these dogs stand between 65 and 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs regular grooming. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is typically black. Schnauzers originated in Germany, where they were used by farmers to assist with sheep herding. They are also employed by the police due to their high intelligence. Schnauzers make excellent family pets as they are friendly and great with young children."

Mary Daniels is a student from England. This year, she had a fascinating summer holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. Their purpose was to help build a road through a forest that connects two large towns.

Mary described the experience as very challenging because there was no drinking water and no shops to buy food. She also mentioned that it was very cold and rainy in the mountains, which are known to be one of the wettest places on Earth. 

Mary spent six weeks in the mountains. Although the work was tough, she believes it was the best experience of her life. She hopes to return next year to continue her efforts there."

**The Long Night**  
This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for many years. The story is about Maha, a nurse in northern Australia, who works in a small hospital. One day, a baby becomes very sick, and Maha must drive all night to take her to the nearest big city. They face many challenges on their journey.

**Hard Work**  
This exciting story is Joanna Jones's twentieth book. It tells the tale of Sombat, who works with his father, a carpenter, in Thailand. They spend long hours making tables and chairs, but they struggle to earn money. One day, a man dressed in black buys the most beautiful table in their shop.

**Hospital or Cinema?**  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. It follows Tina, a young Brazilian woman whose dream is to become a doctor. She travels to London to study English and medicine, but one day she meets a man who invites her to the USA to become a film star. What choice will Tina make?"
KET_53,"**The History of Horse Racing**

Horse racing has been an important sport since the earliest history books were written. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started in the 12th century when Arab horses were brought to Europe. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses, but this changed in the early 18th century. Races became shorter and included multiple horses competing against each other. Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball, and it is also very popular in many other parts of the world."
KET_55,"Nick Barlow is a world traveler and a British actor who enjoys his job. He travels globally to create TV shows. ""People are friendly to me wherever I go, and when I return home, I think about all the amazing experiences I've had in different countries,"" he shares. Although Nick has visited many places, he still wishes to travel to South America and return to Australia someday.

On his trips, Nick works with a team that brings cameras and other equipment for filming. He doesn't pack much for himself, just a few shirts and pants, but he always includes some books in his luggage. His wife, Helen, supports his travels. She has many friends and stays busy while he is away. When he returns, she enjoys hearing about his adventures.

However, there can be challenges. While in the Malaysian rainforest, Nick learned that his wife was in the hospital. ""I felt awful because I couldn't be there to help her, but she insisted I stay. I was so relieved when I found out she was better."""
KET_50,"**Parrots**

You may have seen these beautiful birds, known for their vibrant colors and long tails, in forests or zoos. Parrots are found in countries such as Brazil, Australia, and India. They typically live in large groups and enjoy eating fruit, which can sometimes create problems for farmers. There are many different species of parrots, but all of them have strong beaks and feet that they use for climbing and grasping food. The largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are quite noisy, but they are intelligent and can easily be taught to talk. Some zoos feature parrot shows, where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"HOWARD BONNIER Bray is a lovely village located about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there around three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier yet, but he is already quite well-known in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in the country. He is only 29 years old. 

When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he chose to spend his money on visiting France and dining in good restaurants instead of buying many clothes and CDs. He also collected a lot of French and English cookbooks—he claims to have over two hundred and fifty! 

So, why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says starting your own restaurant is expensive and cooking for fifty people is much harder than cooking for your family, but he believes he has made the right choice."
KET_34,"**John Pickering**

In a small town in central England, John Pickering mows the grass and waters the flowers in a park. However, last week, he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television. John is currently the top singer in Japan. A few months ago, he traveled to Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his music and played it on his radio show. Many young people called the station, asking to hear his songs again.

John, who goes by the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, plans to continue working in the park in England. He is unsure how much money he will make from his music. ""I need to keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have bills to pay!"" The other gardeners do not know about his fame in Japan; they have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This will not change our life. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"**Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. In nearly every town, there are clubs and classes for this enjoyable activity. 

""Line dancing is simple to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to meet new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. The boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!""

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began around fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"The Rhino

There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the other types live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough, and they have very little hair. A rhino's big body rests on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they primarily eat grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilograms at birth and stays in its mother for around fifteen months. An adult rhino can weigh over 200 kilograms and may live for up to 50 years."
KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, we see police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid much. Around 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people lived in poverty. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, making people afraid to leave their homes.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of individuals to catch thieves. They were similar to police officers and were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, the number of Bow Street Runners had increased to 120, but London had grown so much that it needed more police.

In 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established, consisting of 3,000 officers. Most of these men patrolled on foot, while a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, police officers in London receive good salaries, and those who still ride horses earn even more than their colleagues."
KET_30,"Attention Students:

KET_7,"Text: 'Experience the Edinburgh Festival! Each year, many people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is filled with performers and artists from around the globe. They gather in Edinburgh for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are vibrant with music and dance from morning until night. You can even watch artists create paintings on the streets. A highlight of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists attend the Festival to watch new films, plays, and listen to music from well-known musicians. This year, there will be over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite stars in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but keep in mind that finding accommodation can be challenging, so consider booking your hotel in advance!'"
KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim beneath the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

To catch fish, you first break the ice to make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and lower it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people enjoy eating them, but after I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I have caught twenty-five! It's a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

One well-known attraction for tourists in London is the Madame Tussaud's museum. In this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous individuals. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures and opened a museum in Paris. Marie assisted him with this work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was imprisoned. While in prison, she had to create wax models of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created around 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were quite expensive, so only wealthy individuals could afford them. These early models looked very different from modern bicycles. Over time, as bicycles became more affordable, many people began to buy them. They started using bicycles for commuting and leisure activities. 

Today, cars are more commonly used than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to ride bicycles to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it difficult to find parking."
KET_63,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were excited to see the elephant show. We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers would give a new brush filled with paint to each elephant and take away the old one. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I was amazed by what I saw! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These groups often work together to hunt for food. Lions typically inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and track other animals easily. All cats require good eyesight to catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."

KET_20,"**THE OSTRICH**

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh over 90 kilograms. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are decreasing. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches can run very fast, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around three years to grow into adults. They eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson, a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain, began snowboarding at the age of 20. She has achieved success in many competitions. Recently, we interviewed her at a snowboarding event in Switzerland and asked why she chose this sport. She explained, ""I have always enjoyed sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It’s easy to learn, and you can become quite skilled in just a few months.""

We inquired about her practice routine. She replied, ""During winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also enjoy running and biking. I truly love all of it! Competing and being in the mountains is wonderful. However, free-riding—doing what you want outside of competitions—is the best part for me.""

When we asked her about learning to snowboard, she said, ""You can learn quickly, but taking lessons is essential. Having the right clothing is also important to stay dry, especially since beginners often fall a lot!"""

KET_64,"**Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man, have climbed it. There are several routes to the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest and takes about five days. It is very popular among tourists. However, only half of those who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro reach the summit. This is often due to sudden changes in the weather. At the start, it can be hot and rainy, but at the top, climbers encounter ice and snow, and temperatures can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, climbers should bring both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"Otters

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were so polluted that many fish and insects died, leaving otters without food. However, today there is plenty of food for them because the rivers have become clean again."

KET_59,"**Buildings**

People have always created buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. Other buildings, like museums, are used to display beautiful items. Many people work together to construct a building. The architect decides how the building will look and creates drawings to share their ideas. Engineers ensure that the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it.

The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a beautiful roof. However, the building is attractive from all angles, not just from above. Another famous roof is on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This unique building resembles a tent made of glass."

KET_32,"The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in southern England that are close to each other. Between these towns, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large image of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. The exact time when the Cerne Giant was created is unknown, but it is believed to be very ancient. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the image. If you visit on May 1st at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill."
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she plans to compete in the 10,000 metres and possibly the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always smiled and laughed, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of any British woman that year.

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail, but it’s not enjoyable for him when she runs ahead and he can't keep up. Gail trains hard, doing a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. She always takes Sundays off from running. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. By the age of ten, he wanted to write music and began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano skills. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six years old. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. Although he is very busy now, he hopes to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"**Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. His ten grandchildren do not live nearby, but they also read his stories and give their opinions on them. This feedback has helped Bill understand what young children enjoy reading.

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His favorite book is his fifth one, called *The Sheepdog*, which tells the story of a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" Last year, this book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced computer technology to make it seem like the animals were talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually feature images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many individuals send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the images are often more appealing than personal photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, and it displayed a picture of a seaside town. Over time, postcards began to show images related to current events, such as accidents or visits from important people. People appreciated these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include pictures."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur because the last one died about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. The exact reason for their extinction is still unknown. Birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. 

Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were over 5,000 different types. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and primarily ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was smaller but much stronger, with sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run quickly due to its long back legs."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can potentially kill a person. They are skilled climbers and can run quickly. However, bears do not have good eyesight; like many animals, they rely on their sense of smell to find food. 

There are seven species of bears. The largest is the polar bear, which can grow to nearly three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one inhabits the forests of North America, while the other is found in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, not all black bears are actually black; they can also be dark brown or reddish-brown. 

The black and white panda bear, native to China, is beloved by many. Unfortunately, there are not many pandas left in the wild today because they struggle to find enough food."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles are found in tropical regions around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually live in slow-moving water but can swim quickly and move fast on land. You often see them in large groups. Crocodiles eat a variety of things, including fish, birds, and small animals. Occasionally, they may also attack larger animals or even humans. There are over ten different species of crocodiles, all of which have very sharp teeth. Although they frequently lose teeth, they quickly grow new ones. Typically, crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. They have long lifespans; the oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers invented the first powered airplane and successfully flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes underwent significant changes. In the 1950s, they became much faster due to the introduction of jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, capable of flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, which allows the trip from London to New York to take only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, making it hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people would get cold and wet if it rained. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, located by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, chat with friends, walk around during the performance, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same location by the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
