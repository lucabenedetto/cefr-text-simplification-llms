'Charging families for their trash might seem like a good idea. It's environmentally friendly and makes sense financially. But it's not that simple. Many families throw away the same amount of trash every week, no matter how much they pay. This is because they pay for the service through their taxes, so it's not like they have a choice.
The real problem is that people throw away too much trash. This means that we need more garbage trucks and workers to take it away. And the government has to pay for the landfills and tipping fees. It's like a big circle: if we don't pay for our trash, we will keep throwing it away.
Some cities have tried charging families for their trash. They give them stickers or tags to put on their trash bags. Only the bags with the stickers get picked up. But, surprisingly, this hasn't worked as well as expected. People just put more trash in their bags, so the weight stays the same. Some people even started throwing their trash away illegally.
The only good thing is that more people started recycling. But this might not be because of the fee. Many people were already recycling before the fee was introduced.
In the end, charging families for their trash might not be the best solution. We need to think about other factors that affect how much trash we throw away, like how much money we have and how much time we have to recycle. We can't just rely on a simple fee to solve the problem.'"

Many people are not happy with their jobs. They feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even people who are very good at their jobs can feel unhappy and unfulfilled. This is because work is not just about doing a job, but also about being a person.
We need to think about what we want to get from our work. We want to be happy, have good relationships, and be respected. But many jobs do not give us these things. For example, hotel workers are often very intelligent and lively, but they have low pay and long hours. This is because hotels have not changed much since the old days.
Hotels could be more than just places to sleep. They could be like a United Nations, where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could use their knowledge to help guests, and guests could learn about different cultures. But this would require hotel owners to change their way of thinking.
Work is a relationship between people. It's not just about doing a job, but about being with others and communicating with them. We need to learn how to talk to each other in a way that is respectful and understanding. This is important because it helps us feel equal and valued.
We need to rethink what we mean by ""work"" and what we want to get from it. We want to be happy, fulfilled, and respected. We want to be able to talk to each other and learn from each other. This is the key to a better life."

'Broadcasting' comes from the idea of sowing seeds widely. It's not just about farming, but also about spreading good things to many people. The idea of broadcasting is to make sure everyone has the same information and can learn from each other. In the past, people thought that a new technology that sends pictures and sounds through the air would be like a big farm, with one central place sending out information to many people. This idea was popular because it fit with how society was changing. People were moving around more, and it was hard for everyone to be together in one place. So, broadcasting was a way for the government to reach everyone with important news and for people to come together and feel connected.
Some people tried to do things differently, like making TV a two-way communication tool like a phone. But big companies and governments wanted to control how TV was used, so those ideas didn't work out. TV was mainly used in public places, like cinemas, and people watched it together. This way, TV could be controlled and made into something that made money.
As people's lives changed and they had more money, they wanted to watch TV at home. This made it easy for companies to sell TVs and make money. TV became a way for people to relax and have fun at home. The way TV was organized was good for the economy and for governments to reach everyone with important information.
Now, TV is changing, and some people think the word 'broadcasting' might not be needed anymore. But for a long time, broadcasting was a way for people to share information and come together, and that's still important today."

'Clutter Sometimes, people have too many things and still feel unhappy. It's normal to want a home that meets our needs, but sometimes we buy too much. Advertisers try to make us feel we need things to be happy. Try not to read advertisements next time you're out. These messages can influence us without us realizing it.
We see advertisements everywhere: TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, and the internet. They tell us to buy, buy, buy. 
Caves are interesting and mysterious. Scientists have studied them for a long time to learn more about them. People who visit caves for fun also help with the research.

'Music and Theatre
I used to think that opera is mainly about theatre. But now I know it's actually about music first. That's how it should be. I come from a world where words and actors are important. There is no one directing the show once it starts, and the performers and audience speak the same language. When I go to a concert or opera, I see that many people don't understand music. Some are embarrassed, while others are amazed by the performers' skills. Even a good musician has worked hard to achieve their talent.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't always understand how actors do their job and aren't always impressed by what they do. They might ask how actors remember all their lines. This doesn't mean theatre audiences are better or worse than concert audiences. They are just different.
I think music could learn from theatre about how to connect with the audience. Music is already theatrical, with passion, humor, and emotion. But the way music is presented often emphasizes the difference between the performers and the audience. This can feel unfair.
There are many people working to make music more accessible and to break down barriers. I saw a great example of this when a community opera was performed in a cathedral and then in the town. It was a fantastic experience, and the musicians were amazing. Maybe what I want from music is a bit more risk-taking and creativity, like theatre can be. Sometimes this means performing in unusual places, which can be surprising and exciting. I love both music and theatre, and I want both to be successful and enjoyable for everyone.'

I don't like sand very much. It's hard and uncomfortable to walk on, and it gets everywhere. It gets in my food, and it's hard to clean up. When I'm at the beach, I try to stay on the towel or get out of the sand as soon as I can. But even then, it stays with me for a long time. I don't like sand.
People have always wanted to have a safe and secure home. We use locks to keep our homes safe. Some locks are electronic, but many people prefer the old-fashioned kind that use a key. It's like having a secret code that only you know. Recently, some companies made a new electronic lock that has a metal key. It's a mix of old and new.
I'm not very good at understanding modern art. I like some of it, like pictures with fur or neon lights. But I don't always know what it means. The new Tate Modern gallery is trying to help people understand modern art better. They have labels that explain what the art is trying to say. It's helpful, but it's not always easy for me to understand.

Making movies from books is a difficult process. It involves cutting out some parts and changing others to make it work on the screen. This can be frustrating, but it can also be interesting. I recently worked on a script and saw how much dialogue and description I could cut out while still getting the same message across.
Movies and books are different. Books need more details to help readers understand, while movies need to show more and tell less. This doesn't mean the extra details in books are unnecessary. They help readers remember things and understand the characters better.
Movies can make us feel like we are part of the story. It's like being in a different world. But when the movie is over, we go back to our normal life. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent watching the movie.
Some people don't think movies are a real art form. They just see them as entertainment. But many people love movies and try to make them.
The Leiper Film Company's studios were a confusing place. There were many small rooms that looked the same, and it was hard to find what you needed. But the people who worked there knew where everything was and could find their way around easily.
Many people want to make movies. There are books and courses to help them learn how. Some people even make movies with just a small camera and a lot of hard work. One person, Robert Rodriguez, made a movie for just $7,000 and became a famous director.
In the past, movie directors took time to learn their job. They worked behind the scenes and made small movies before making big ones. But now, with the help of the internet and technology, people can make movies faster and more easily."

I grew up in a place called West Earlham. The houses there were old and not very nice. In the summer, a bad smell came from a factory nearby. I don't remember much from when I was little, but I do remember sitting on a high chair and looking at the houses getting smaller and smaller. My mom was a strict person who liked things to be perfect. She was always angry and I didn't know why. Sometimes she would take me to the shops or on trips to the city. I knew she was different from other people.
I had a hard time understanding my mom's rules. She wanted me to be good and not make mistakes. She didn't like it when I played in other people's gardens or talked too much. She liked to listen to the radio and sit quietly. My mom had some friends who were also strict and didn't like to talk much. They would talk about boring things like the weather and their problems.
I felt like I was stuck under a heavy weight, with my mom and her friends and the rules she made. I wanted to be free, but it was hard. When I was little, I just played at home or went to school. I didn't like school, but I liked the summer holidays. I would see old men who told stories and go to fairs where they gave out lemonade. My mom didn't like some things, like people asking for money. She thought politicians were bad. She took me to the museum on Sundays and we would look at paintings. She was trying to teach me, but she didn't know how to have fun. Once, she made a joke about a painting of a Roman soldier, but it was a rare moment.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. The sun was setting, and the air was humid and misty. I knew this street from when I was a child. There were many houses and shops, and I had friends who lived there. As I walked, I noticed that the houses got smaller and the yards got smaller too. Over time, some houses that were once homes became shops, and some shops became homes again.
I visited a friend who lives in a big, open space that used to be a curtain warehouse. He wanted to make it feel like a home, so he put up a big plastic sheet to divide the space. He also added a kitchen and some furniture that his parents gave him. He likes to have friends over and cook for them.
I also thought about a famous writer named Bruce Chatwin. He loved to travel and write about his adventures. He wrote a book called ""In Patagonia"" that is very famous. But sometimes he made things up to make the story more interesting.
One summer, it rained a lot, and I liked swimming in my pool. I would swim up and down and look at the water level. The rain made the water look like it was rising up to meet the sky. I thought about swimming a long way to follow the rain and see where it goes. Swimming is a way to get away from the usual routine and feel free.
Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But swimming, walking, and cycling are ways to get away from all that and feel like we're in a wild, natural world.

Charles Darwin thought that people crying didn't serve a purpose. But scientists now think differently. Crying helps us connect with others. A doctor named John Bowlby said that crying helps children and their mothers get close. Many people think that crying is a way to show that we need help. But why do we still cry as adults? It's not just the sound of crying that matters, but the way it looks. Crying might have helped our ancestors feel safe and connected to each other. We might cry to show sympathy for people who are suffering. We might also cry when we hear something beautiful or sad. We might cry when we watch a sad movie, but this is more likely to happen when we're with others. It's clear that crying helps us connect with others, but scientists are still learning more.

The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. We know it's happening, but we're not sure how much warmer it will get and how it will affect our lives. A warmer climate means changes to the weather everywhere in the world. This will have big effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
We use the Earth's natural resources to live. We produce food, build cities, and support a lot of people. Any changes to these resources are important. We don't know exactly how the world will change, and we're not sure what's causing the changes.
Some scientists think that the Earth has warmed by about 6°C over the past 100 years. They think this is partly because of human activities that release bad things into the air. We don't fully understand the Earth's climate system, but we know it's complex.
Scientists use computers to try to predict what will happen when the Earth gets warmer. They use these predictions to learn about the future. They think that the Earth will get warmer by 1-3.5°C by the year 2100. They also think that sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm and that there will be more extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts.
Changes to the climate can affect where plants and animals live, the types of plants and animals that live there, and how we get food and water. Some places will be affected badly, but others might be better. For example, some areas might get more rain and be good for farming.
However, many places will be affected badly. Rising sea levels will cause flooding and damage to homes and cities. Many people will lose their homes and livelihoods, and this could create many environmental refugees. Some small island nations might even disappear.

This could be the first time humans will travel to Mars if a rich man named Dennis Tito's plan works. The plan is to send a special capsule to about 160 km above Mars. The capsule will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using too much fuel. This is important because we want to save fuel. The next time Mars and Earth are close together is in 2031, so we have to hurry. It's a big challenge, but it's worth it because we will learn new things that will help us on future trips to space.'

* Removing technical terms (e.g. ""fuel efficiency"" and ""launch window"")
* Making the language more concrete and easy to understand (e.g. ""the next time Mars and Earth are close together is in 2031"" instead of ""the next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031"")

Art is often difficult to understand because we think of it as something separate from our everyday lives. We think of art as a painting, a book, or a statue, and we separate it from the people who created it and the experiences it gives us. This makes it hard to understand the true meaning of art.
Art is not just something we see and admire; it is something that happens in our daily lives. It is like a mountain, which is not just a physical object, but a part of the earth. To understand art, we need to think about the everyday things that happen around us, like our emotions, our relationships, and our experiences.
We don't need to be experts to enjoy art. We can enjoy a beautiful sunset, a good meal, or a funny joke. But to truly understand art, we need to think about why we enjoy these things and how they make us feel.
Many people think that art is only for special occasions, like going to a museum or a concert. But art is all around us, even in things we don't usually consider art, like movies, music, or comics. When we connect art to our everyday lives, we can appreciate it more and understand its true meaning.

Lions are amazing animals. They work together to hunt for food. They are like a team. But, after many years of studying them, we have a different idea. We thought that lions would work together because it would help them survive. But, sometimes, when one lion helps another, it might not help itself. So, why do lions still work together?

When I was a child, I was fascinated by a story about a wise woman who could predict the future. She was very smart and knew many things.

I like to travel in my mind and learn about the past.
**Writing a Book**
When you write a book, you usually send it to a publisher. The publisher has a big pile of books to read, and it might take a long time for your book to be read. The person who reads your book is usually a young editor or an older editor who comes in a few days a week. They want to find a new and interesting book. If they like your book, they will pass it to a more important editor, and eventually, it will be accepted or rejected. The editor will also think about whether you are a good writer and whether your book can be sold well."

Here is a simplified version of the passage at the A2 level:
Advertising was a tough time in the 1990s. The economy was bad, and many businesses were struggling. In the UK, the economy was getting worse, and many people lost their jobs. Companies were spending less money, and advertising agencies were under a lot of pressure.
Advertising agencies are responsible for helping companies sell their products. They have to come up with good ideas for ads and make sure they are shown to the right people. But in the 1990s, they were facing many challenges. They had to work with smaller budgets, and many companies were questioning whether advertising was worth the cost.
Some companies were not sure if they were getting a good return on their investment in advertising. They wanted to see better results, and they were looking for ways to make their ads more effective. This was a difficult time for advertising agencies, and many people in the industry were worried about their jobs.
The situation was made even more complicated by demographic changes, changes in consumer behavior, and new laws and regulations. It was a challenging time for advertising agencies, and many people were struggling to come up with good ideas for ads.
In this difficult environment, it was hard for advertising agencies to produce high-quality ads that worked well. Many companies were keeping their strategies and ideas secret, so it was hard for others to learn from their successes and failures. As a result, there were few resources available to help advertising agencies improve their work.

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. My friends thought this was strange because cooking is not a popular job. People often think that chefs have a hard and stressful life. But I didn't care. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life was not interesting. Being a chef seemed like a good way to escape all that. I also loved cooking because it's an art. I had a great experience when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing, and I felt happy for days afterwards. After that, I wanted to learn more about cooking. I read cookbooks, went to markets, and cooked big meals. My studies became less important to me.
I also learned how to dive. The instructor was a strict man who taught me how to dive from a high board. He was very serious and told me to look up and keep my legs straight. I felt scared, but I tried my best. When I jumped into the water, I felt free and happy. Even though I didn't do it perfectly, I felt proud of myself.
Some people like to travel and take risks. They might climb mountains, sail in the sea, or live in the wilderness. These people are very brave and interesting. But for most of us, it's hard to understand why they would want to do these things. We prefer a comfortable life with a warm bed, running water, and a safe place to live."

Summer is a great time for holidays. We can go to new places and read books. Reading books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can find books that describe things we have experienced or thought about. Authors can use words to explain how we feel, and this can be very helpful.
When we travel, we meet new people and see new things. This can help us open our eyes to things we didn't notice before. We start to pay attention to small things, like the sky, people's faces, and the way things are.
I wrote these travel articles for a newspaper over seven years. I didn't change much, just a few small things to make it fit on the page. I also corrected some mistakes.

Music in the Future
Music is an important part of our lives. We listen to it, play it, and enjoy it. Technology has changed the way we experience music. We can now listen to music on our phones, computers, and tablets. This has made it easier for people to enjoy music. However, it has also meant that fewer people are going to concerts and listening to live music.
In the past, people used to listen to music on the radio, TV, records, and CDs. Now, we have many more ways to listen to music. This has made music more accessible to everyone. But, it has also meant that fewer people are learning to play musical instruments.
Music is important for many reasons. It brings people together, helps us express ourselves, and makes us happy. It is also important for our brains. Research has shown that playing a musical instrument can help us think better and be more focused.
In the future, music will continue to be important. People will still want to listen to music and play instruments. But, the way we do things might change. We might see new types of music and new ways of making music. Technology will play a big role in this.
To prepare for the future, music teachers will need to adapt. They will need to teach people of all ages and abilities. They will need to be good communicators and able to work with people from different backgrounds.
Music is important, but it is often taken for granted. People who work in the music industry need to work together to make sure music is valued and appreciated.

Actors often get criticized. Sometimes, they even criticize themselves when talking about their work. But it's hard to talk about acting without making it sound boring or fake. A famous actor, Paul Scofield, said that an actor's work is only interesting when they're performing it. When they talk about it, it becomes empty and uninteresting.
A review of a play, Hamlet, says that the actor, Adrian Lester, did a great job. He played the main character, Hamlet, with confidence and skill. He made the character seem real and relatable.
So, what is acting? Is it just imitating someone or something, or is it bringing something to life? This is a big question about the theatre.
One way to prepare for a play is to start by reading the script and thinking about the words. Then, when it's time to perform, the actors think about what the words mean to them and why they want to say them. This helps them find the right emotions and feelings.
The perfect theatre is one that makes you feel like you're a part of the performance. The actors and staff should all work together to create a special atmosphere. The theatre itself should be designed to make you feel close to the action on stage. It's important to have a sense of history and tradition in the theatre, too.
It's hard to know what people will like in a play, so you can't try to please everyone. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and exciting, something that you can't imagine seeing anywhere else."

**Sharing Secrets on the Internet**
Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of sharing where you are on the internet. The website said that when you tell people where you are, you're also telling many others who might not be people you want to meet. This made people think about the downsides of sharing everything online.
The internet gives us many opportunities to share our lives with a huge number of people. We can share photos, stories, and secrets. But sometimes we realize that the internet is like a big ocean, and we can get lost in it. It's like being in a crowd and not knowing where to go.
A long time ago, some brave people started sharing their lives online. They wrote about their jobs, their friends, and their lives. They showed us that it's possible to share our lives online, but we need to be careful.
One of these pioneers was a young man named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life on the internet in 1994. He wrote about his daily life, including his relationships and his feelings. He even shared photos and art. People loved reading about his life, and he became famous.
But Justin's story took a surprising turn. He fell in love, and his partner didn't like him sharing their relationship online. Justin had to choose between keeping his blog or losing his partner. He chose to stop writing about his life online.
Another person who shared her life online was Heather Armstrong. She wrote about her job and her life on a blog called Dooce. But one day, her boss found out about her blog and fired her. This happened because people can easily share information online, and sometimes it can hurt us.
Heather learned a valuable lesson. She realized that what we share online can affect our real lives. She stopped writing about her life online for a while, but then started again, this time focusing on her family. Today, she is a successful blogger and writer.

Many people today are tired and sleep-deprived. This is because they are busy and have a lot to do. Research has found that 40 million Americans are not getting enough sleep. Some famous books have even featured characters who can't sleep.
Sleep is important for our bodies and minds. We need to sleep to feel rested and refreshed. But many people don't get enough sleep because they wake up early to avoid traffic or rush hour.
A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they started sleeping for 8-9 hours a night. This shows how important sleep is for our bodies.
In Europe, there is a special sleep laboratory where scientists study sleep. They test how sleep affects people's bodies and minds. They also study how noise, like traffic, can affect sleep.
The scientists use a special car simulator to test how people drive after not sleeping well. They find that even after just one night without sleep, people can still drive safely if they drink two cups of coffee.
We know that humans sleep in a daily cycle, switching between different stages of sleep. We also know that women sleep for longer than men and that older people need less sleep. But we are not sure why.
Some scientists think that sleep helps our bodies repair themselves, but this might happen while we are awake too. We also don't know exactly what sleep is for, but some scientists think it's like traveling through time without getting hurt.
In the past, people used to sleep differently. They would sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then go back to sleep. This was a time for reflection and relaxation. Today, most people sleep for a solid night, but in some parts of the world, people still sleep in short bursts throughout the night.
Overall, people all around the world need more sleep to feel rested and refreshed."

I'm wearing big, expensive cowboy boots. They cost $800 each. I'm trying to be a cowboy, but I'm not really one. I'm standing in the Arizona desert, looking at the mountains. I feel out of place. I flew in from Denver early in the morning, and I thought I might be a real cowboy. But then I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He was wearing a dirty T-shirt and carrying a bag. He looked at my boots and walked away.
I used to be a racing driver. I loved it, but I don't do it anymore. I don't know what I want to do now. I thought about being a commentator for racing, but there are already many people doing that job. I also thought about selling old cars, but it didn't work out.
Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. Nobody wants to hear about my racing stories because they don't end well. I don't get any sympathy, and I don't need it. I had a good career, made money, and did okay. But I miss racing. I miss the thrill of driving a fast car and the attention from people. Now, I have a lot of free time and nothing to do. I looked up at the sky and saw some birds in a cactus. They were telling me to leave them alone. It made me realize that I have a lot to learn about being a ""cowboy"" in the desert.

Vancouver is a city in western Canada where many people from around the world have moved to live. The city is known for its mild climate, beautiful surroundings, and good environment. People come to Vancouver for work, study, and to enjoy its clean and safe streets.
In the evenings, people like to walk around the city and listen to different languages being spoken. Vancouver is a popular place to live, and many new buildings have been built recently. This has helped make the city a more exciting place.
The city used to be called ""Terminal City"" because it was a place where people would start their journeys to other places. Now, Vancouver is still a gateway to many other places, but it's also a popular destination in its own right.
Journalists often have trouble writing letters because they are always trying to make their writing interesting. This makes it hard for them to write in a natural way. Artists who are good at their job don't have this problem because they don't think about how their work will be received.

Citizen Kane is a famous film made in 1941. People were very excited to see it, but it didn't do well at the box office. It wasn't until it was shown on television that people started talking about it again. This film is special because it inspired many people to become film directors. The director, Orson Welles, was very young when he made this film. He had a great team working with him, including a cameraman, a screenwriter, and a special effects expert.
The story is about a newspaper owner who is like a famous person named William Randolph Hearst. Welles liked this idea because he could play the main character himself. He and his screenwriter came up with the idea of making a film about a newspaper owner who is like Hearst, but not exactly like him.

Some people think that job titles are important. A recent study found that many people are jealous of their colleagues' job titles. The study showed that 70% of people would rather have a better job title than a pay rise. This shows that people are very concerned about their status at work. The truth is that many job titles are just fancy words and don't really mean anything."

I went to Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. They are my job and my hobby. I like the way light falls on things and how one picture can capture a moment or a place. One day, I might take the perfect picture. I have been doing this for a long time.
I went freelance after one of my pictures became famous. It was a lucky accident. But sometimes you make your own luck, good and bad. I was in Vienna because I was hired to take pictures for a book about four cities in four seasons. I took pictures of London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I like to take my own special pictures.
The Austrian publisher asked me to take over a project in Vienna because the original photographer left. I was free and they liked my work. I was happy to go. I stayed at a hotel in the old city and walked around. It was cold and snowy. I took my time and looked around until I saw the city clearly. Then I was ready to take pictures.
I went out early one morning to take pictures of Stephansplatz. The snow was still falling and it was quiet. The cathedral was big and impressive, but it was hard to take a good picture of it. I had to settle for a partial shot. It was still magical in the snow.
Photography is special. It's like magic. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a picture. It's a mystery that never goes away. Maybe that's why I love taking pictures so much."

The Hayward Gallery in London is a special place that shows art. Usually, it's serious and boring, but this time it's different. The exhibition is about a type of art that moves or makes us think about movement. It's not a big, flashy show, but it's very interesting.
The exhibition shows many different artworks, like paintings, drawings, and films. The curator, Guy Brett, has collected them all and wants us to discover them for ourselves. We don't need to read a lot of words to understand what we're looking at. We can just enjoy the art and think about what it means.
Some people like art that is easy to understand, like David Hockney's paintings. They might like it because it's colorful and fun. But some people don't like Hockney's art because it's popular and not ""high art"". But that doesn't mean his art isn't good.
Sometimes, art exhibitions try to tell us what to think or make us think about certain things. But this exhibition is different. It just shows us the art and lets us decide what we think about it.
Art is a personal thing. People like different things, and that's okay. Some people like to look at art and just enjoy it, without thinking too much about it. Others like to learn more about the art and why it was made. Both ways are okay.
In the end, what we like about art is not just about our own feelings, but also about the culture and society we live in."

Metals
A long time ago, people might have wanted to wear shiny things to look nice. One day, someone might have found a yellow stone by a river and picked it up. It was different from regular stones. Maybe this is how people first found gold. Because gold is soft, it was easy to work with and soon people wanted it a lot.
Copper might have been found by accident too. When people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for more copper and finding ways to get it out of the ground. This helped people make new things.
St Ives
We walked down a narrow, cobblestone street to the center of town. The wind was very strong and the sea was crashing against the wall. There were no people outside and all the shutters were closed. We had taken a small train to get to St Ives and the weather was getting worse. I had promised my friend that we would have nice walks and cozy evenings by the fire. Computer Modelling
It's hard to learn about the past because it's already happened. The people who lived a long time ago are dead. We can't ask them questions or test our ideas. Archaeologists find clues, but we can't do experiments. We can't go back in time and see what happened. But maybe we can. We can use computers to create a fake world with fake people. We can make rules for them and see how they behave. We can change the weather or the number of people and see how they react.

**Vervet Monkeys**
One day, a strange monkey came to a group of vervet monkeys. The group's leader was worried that the stranger might take over his position. So, the leader had an idea. When the stranger came near, the leader made a loud noise like a leopard is coming. The stranger ran away. This happened several times. But one day, the leader made a mistake. He made the noise again, but this time he was walking across the open ground. The stranger did not run away.
**Cats**
In a small village in England, people collected their cats' prey over one year. They found that 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor thought that if all the cats in Britain did the same, they would catch 100 million animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats are in towns and don't catch many animals. The important question is: can the number of animals caught by cats be sustained? The answer is yes. Many people feed birds, and birds have places to nest, so there are many birds. The cats are a problem, but they are not destroying the bird population.
**Buffaloes**
Buffaloes are very important to the people who take care of them. In the morning, the buffaloes go to a special place to eat and rest. They walk slowly and make sad noises. They like to stay in the water and eat plants. They spend the day eating and resting.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for an A2 learner:
Photography has been used to capture important moments and scenes for over 150 years. During this time, it has become possible to take pictures of things that are very big or very small, and even of things that are far away. Photography has helped us to understand the world and its many different cultures. It has also shown us the beauty and complexity of human life.
The idea of photography is not new. People have been creating images for thousands of years. The earliest pictures were painted on cave walls over 35,000 years ago. These images were important to people's daily lives and helped them to understand the world around them.
When photography was invented, it was seen as a way to capture the truth. People believed that a camera could take a picture that was exactly like what we see with our own eyes. This idea was very important and changed the way people thought about pictures.
Photography has also helped us to understand different cultures and ways of life. People thought that everyone would be able to understand pictures, no matter where they came from. However, we now know that this is not always true. Photography can be affected by the culture and customs of the people who take the pictures.
Today, photography is used to capture important moments and to show us the world in a new way. It has helped to change the way we think about culture and society. Photography can be used to make people think about important issues and to bring about change."

**Writing Poetry and Stories**
Writing poetry and stories is like playing a game. You need to be careful and creative. Some people like to write when they feel happy and secure. Others write when they are sad or upset. Everyone writes in their own way.
**Short Stories**
When writing a short story, you need to be brief and clear. You can't have too many characters or too much talking. You can use memories from the past to help move the story forward. Dialogue is important because it helps to show what people are thinking and feeling.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves carefully. You need to consider the big picture and how each move fits into it.
**Language**
Language is natural for humans. We learn to speak without trying. But writing is different. We need to learn how to write and it's not easy. Children don't naturally learn to write. They need to be taught.

I'm writing a book about a man I knew, but I'm not sure what to call it. It's not a typical story with a beginning, middle, and end. I don't know much about what happened to him between our meetings. I could make things up to make the story more interesting, but I don't want to do that. I just want to tell what I know.
To protect the people in the story, I've given them fake names. I've also tried to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and he might not be remembered after he dies. But maybe his way of living and his kind heart will make a difference in people's lives, and they'll remember him long after he's gone.
I don't pretend that the conversations I've recorded are exact quotes. I don't have notes, but I have a good memory for important things. I've written the conversations in my own words, but they're true to what was said.
I've taken some liberties with what the characters say, just like historians do. I want my book to be interesting and easy to read. If you're a smart reader, you'll be able to tell when I've done this.
I'm worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from a different place. People are shaped by where they grow up, what they eat, what they learn, and what they read. You can't learn all that by hearing about it; you have to experience it yourself. I've only written about people from my own country before, and I'm not sure I can do it justice with someone from a different place."

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for an A2 level learner:
Poetry Recitals
At any time, people may think that the world of poetry is confusing. But when we look back, we can see that there were always different kinds of poetry and different ways of writing it. Today, there are many different types of poetry and many different ways of performing it. Some poets write for people to read on their own, while others write for people to hear live.
Some people think that there is a big difference between these two kinds of poets. Those who write for reading think that the other kind of poet is not as serious about their work. The poets who perform live think that the other kind of poet is not as good at connecting with people.
However, there are many poetry recitals happening all the time. Small groups of people in towns and cities invite poets to come and read their work. Schools and colleges also invite poets to come and talk to their students. At festivals, people can hear well-known poets read their poetry.
The benefits of these events are not clear. For some poets, performing live is the best way to share their work. For others, it can be a challenge to get people to understand their poetry.
It's important to remember that poetry is best appreciated when you read it on the page. Hearing a poet read their work can be helpful, but it's better to have read the poem before. The main reason for poetry recitals is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for special people.

**Oral History**
When historians ask people to tell them about the past, it's not always easy. The person telling the story can be affected by the historian asking the questions. Even if the historian doesn't ask questions, just being there can change how the person remembers the past. The historian also chooses who to talk to and what questions to ask, so they have a big influence on the story.
But even the person telling the story isn't always telling the truth. They might remember things from what they saw or heard on TV or from their parents. They might also remember things that happened later and mix them up with what really happened.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: by looking at how their bodies work and by studying their behavior in their natural habitat. Some scientists look at how animals learn, while others study how they behave naturally.
Some scientists think that understanding how animals' bodies work is the most important. But others think that studying how animals behave is just as important. They think that trying to understand how animals' bodies work isn't enough to understand how they really behave.
**Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you have to do two things at once. You have to learn about the subject and learn how to do research. It's like learning a new language - you have to learn the words and how to use them.
Social sciences are not just common sense. Each subject has its own special way of thinking and its own special words. It's like learning a new language, and it takes time and practice.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was an art. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He didn't think about what the buildings were used for, just how they looked.
The origins of classical architecture are complicated. People built simple houses a long time ago, and these houses had some important features that stayed with them as they built more complicated buildings.

The internet is a great place for people to share their opinions about books. A long time ago, only a few people could share their thoughts about books. But with the internet, anyone can write a review and share it with others. Amazon, a big online bookshop, made it easy for people to write reviews. They allowed anyone to write a review and give a book up to five stars.
At first, it was a great idea. People could read what others thought of a book before buying it. But soon, some people started to misuse the system. They wrote fake reviews to make their own books look good or to make other books look bad. Amazon had to hire people to check the reviews to make sure they followed the rules.
Some authors even wrote fake reviews to help their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was so upset about the bad reviews for his book that he wrote some good reviews himself. But he got caught and had to admit it.
The problem was that anyone could write a review, even if they weren't the author of the book. Some people wrote fake reviews to hurt the feelings of authors or to make fun of books. But most people wrote honest reviews and helped others decide what books to buy.
Amazon liked that people were taking the time to write reviews. It helped them to sell more books. The writer George Orwell thought that writing reviews was hard because you had to think about what you really felt about a book. But with the internet, anyone can write a review and share their thoughts with others."

Art is important. People like art that is special and new. But sometimes, we don't understand art that is different from what we are used to. We think that art should be unique and special, like the art of the past. But we don't always appreciate the art of today.
Imagine a situation. An artist chooses a text from a book about art. The text says that there are many different kinds of pictures. The artist then asks someone to paint a canvas with the text on it. The text is written in simple black letters on a white canvas. The question is: is this a painting?
Artists are expected to make the same kind of art that people like. If they try something new, people might not like it. Some artists are successful and can try new things. Eric Rimmington is an artist who is doing something new. He is painting the London Underground. He likes the Underground and wants to show people its magic.
I have escaped to a small island to rest and think. I am alone, except for a villager who comes to clean my house. I am not happy or unhappy; I just exist. I don't think art is useful, but it can help us make sense of the world. Art can show us the important things that we might miss in our daily lives. It can also help us deal with the bad things that happen to us. That's why we make art."

Heritage is important because it helps us feel connected to the past. We usually know about our family history and the stories of our grandparents. But we also need to learn about our national history to understand our present and future. Heritage is like a connection to our past that helps us feel secure about our future. It's like inheriting a culture that has been passed down through generations.
We can learn a lot from our heritage, including customs and traditions. In the past, people used to pass down stories and legends from their ancestors. But now, we can also learn from museums and historical places. Museums are important because they show us real objects that actually existed in the past.

Here is a simplified version of the text, written for a learner of English at level A2:
Writing Reviews
Frank Kermode talks about the job of writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and are only published for a short time. They are usually short and are often only read by people who are interested in the topic. Some people think that reviewing is not a important job because it's not as valuable as writing a novel or a long book. However, reviewing is a difficult job that requires skill and knowledge. A reviewer needs to be able to write clearly and concisely, and they need to know a lot about different subjects.
A reviewer also needs to think about who their audience is. They might be writing for people who just want a quick summary or for people who are interested in reading a longer, more detailed review. The reviewer needs to be able to write in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Some reviewers, like the American writer John Updike, also write other things besides reviews. They might write novels or essays. They might even collect their reviews and publish them in a book.
In some countries, it's common for professors to write reviews as well as academic books. This can be a good thing because it helps readers know that the reviewer is an expert in the subject. It also reminds professors that they need to be able to explain their ideas in a way that everyone can understand.
Overall, reviewing is an important job that requires skill and knowledge. It's not always easy, but it can be a rewarding way to share your opinions with others."

Ralph came home to his flat. He felt a little nervous, like he did sometimes. When he first bought the flat, he was excited to come home and see what had happened while he was away. He thought of it as his own special place, where he could relax and be himself.
As he walked in, he saw that everything was still there, just as he left it. Sometimes there were letters or messages on the answering machine. Ralph was grateful that nothing was broken or damaged.
Ralph worked in an office and often looked forward to his free evenings at home. He liked being alone with his things and his thoughts. But sometimes he felt empty and wondered who he was doing all this for.
Ralph used to have big plans for his life, but they didn't work out. He took a job at a local newspaper, but it wasn't what he really wanted. He just wanted to survive and be happy. He didn't think about the future or what he really wanted.
Ralph's boss, Neil, offered him the job on the spot. Ralph was relieved and thought it was a good thing. But now, every day is the same and Ralph feels trapped. He wishes he could go back to being himself and do what makes him happy.

Goat Racing
I was going to watch a goat racing competition on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, food stalls, and music. I had to push my way through the crowd to get a good spot. A special area was set up for the goats to run. The goats are very hungry and will eat almost anything. It was hard to keep them in order.
Canoe Trip
As the day ended, I thought about the night ahead. We were in a canoe and had nowhere to sleep. We hadn't seen any villages or houses since morning. It was dark, and our torch was not working well. We looked for a place to camp, but couldn't find one.
Presentation Skills
I'm not good at making presentations, but I have to do it often as a managing director. I want to improve my skills and feel more confident. Many people struggle with presentations, especially if they're not used to it. To do well, you need to be convinced of what you're saying. Show your passion and enthusiasm. Make sure you're prepared by doing your homework and thinking about the questions your audience might ask. Start your presentation by finding something you all have in common and build up to your main point.

There are some things that can't be rushed. You can't hurry mayonnaise or a fishing line, and you can't rush your mind either. Some parts of your brain work fast, like when you react quickly to danger. Other parts work slower, like when you're thinking deeply about something.
There are three kinds of thinking: fast, slow, and in between. Fast thinking is like a reflex. It's like when you ride a bike and your body knows what to do without you thinking about it. Slow thinking is like when you're trying to figure something out. You need to think carefully and make a plan. And then there's the slow, dreamy kind of thinking. It's like when you're daydreaming or lost in thought.
This slow, dreamy thinking is important too. It helps us solve problems that are hard to understand. It's like when you're trying to figure out a puzzle. You need to take your time and think carefully. This kind of thinking is important for creativity and wisdom.
Some people are good at solving problems quickly, and some are good at thinking deeply. But we all need to use all three kinds of thinking to be smart. We need to be able to think fast, slow, and in between."

I'm using my school French to communicate, but it's not easy to have a conversation. I miss the nuances of language and my phrasebook doesn't help at breakfast.
I was worried about eating with others because I didn't know what to do or say. I felt shy and anxious. But now I'm okay. I think I was missing being the center of attention, which I'm used to.

Amateur Astronomy
Many things have changed in astronomy over the past 50 years. In the past, there were not many books or charts for amateur astronomers. Now, there are many telescopes and books available. Computers and calculators have made it easier to use and understand the information. This makes it a good time for people who like astronomy.
But, there are some problems too. The sky is not as clear as it used to be because of airplanes and pollution. This makes it hard to see the stars at night.

I'm going to tell you about two interesting things. First, I saw a play called Othello by Shakespeare. I didn't like it when it first opened, but now I think the actor, Ray Fearon, did a great job. The whole cast was excellent. There were some scenes that were very memorable, like when the characters got into trouble and when someone was very sad. The play was very exciting and I would recommend it.
Second, I want to tell you about a lake in Antarctica called Lake Vostok. It's under a lot of ice and has been there for 25 million years. Scientists are very interested in it because they think there might be strange creatures living in the lake. They want to find out more about it and are trying to come up with a plan to explore it.
Finally, I heard a radio show about scientists who are talking about why they want to learn more about the world. Some scientists are asking why we want to know everything and why we can't just be happy with what we know. I think the most important thing is to remember that science is a tool and we should use it to make our lives better, not just because we want to know everything.

Food is important to us. We like to cook and eat together. It's not always easy to make food, but it's worth it. We can make a delicious soup with just a few simple ingredients. We can also make a yummy dessert without buying a packet or can.
Cooking is a way to show love and care. When we cook for others, we are showing them that we care about them. Sharing food is special. We often share food with others on special occasions like birthdays, weddings, and holidays.

Dr. Johnson said that writing is hard work. If you don't put effort into writing, people won't enjoy reading it. I looked back at my old school essays and was surprised to see how few mistakes I made. I think it's because writing by hand takes time and makes you think carefully. When you type on a computer, it's easy to make mistakes and it's hard to correct them.
Many people think that writing on a computer is better than writing by hand. But I think that's not true. When you write by hand, you have to think carefully about what you're writing. You can't just type quickly without thinking. And when you make a mistake, you have to erase it and start again. This makes you write more carefully.
People are sending more emails now than they used to send letters. This is good because it means people are writing to each other more often. But some people are not very good at writing emails. They don't think about what they're writing and they make mistakes. This can cause problems.
I went to a friend's house and he showed me his CDs. He said they were amazing because they could hold a lot of music. I asked him if you had to turn them over like records, and he said no. He said you could only play one side. I asked him why, and he said he didn't know. He thought it would be better if you could play both sides.
When comparing books and electronic text, some people think that electronic text is a big improvement. But I think it's not as good. Books are better because you can read them anywhere and you don't need a computer. You can also hold a book in your hand and turn the pages.

Lancelot's secretary, a woman he had been working with for many months, asked him if he took sugar in his coffee. She didn't really ask, she just said it because she knew the answer. Lancelot usually stayed at work all the time now, not just sometimes. He used to be a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, but now he was more like a helper, always trying to stop things from going wrong.
She put a folder in front of him. 'This is from Ian Cuthbert in Los Angeles,' she said. Lancelot didn't want to see the folder. He had already seen a summary of the book, and he didn't want to see another one. Ian Cuthbert was a friend who had been given a lot of money to write a book. But Ian was very difficult to work with, and Lancelot was starting to think that the book would never be finished.
Lancelot looked at the folder and saw that it was the same summary he had seen before. He didn't recognize any new ideas or exciting things. He closed the folder and put it aside. He thought that Ian would never finish the book. Ian was supposed to be a great writer, but he was having trouble coming up with new ideas. Lancelot remembered a famous author who died before finishing his book. But at least that author had been paid a little bit of money for each chapter. Ian, on the other hand, had been given a lot of money upfront, but he wasn't delivering.

'Breakfast in England: A New Tradition
Many experts agree that breakfast is very important for our health. But did you know that in the past, not many people in England had breakfast? In fact, it was a rare habit until the 16th century. 
Before then, only rich people like kings and queens would eat breakfast. But as time went on, more people started to eat breakfast because there was more food available. Another reason is that people's jobs changed. Many people started working at fixed hours, and they needed to eat breakfast to give them energy for the day.
In the end, breakfast became a normal part of daily life, not just for the rich. It was no longer just about being a special treat, but about having a good start to the day.'"

'Photography When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show and how to show it. This is based on their skills, what they think is important, and what they've learned. This book will look at how these things affect the picture and how people see and react to it. For example, when we look at a photo in a newspaper, we might wonder if it really shows what it's supposed to show. Or, does it show what the photographer wants us to see? Is the moment in the picture important, or is it just a symbol?

Birds have always been important to human culture. People love, fear, or worship them. But what does this say about us? 
I'm sitting in my greenhouse, and I hear a strange noise. It's a little brown bird, a wren, bouncing around. Some people think wrens are special birds that can tell us important messages. Others think it's just a bird stuck in the greenhouse. 
Wrens have been a part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could predict their luck. Today, many British people still have pictures and ceramics with wrens on them. 
Wrens are special because they have a lot of meaning in our culture. They remind us of a time when people were more connected to nature. 
Other birds, like the red kite, have also been important to people. In the past, people thought red kites were cool and would feed them bread. But later, people started to see them as pests, and they almost disappeared. Now, people are trying to help them come back.
Birds are important to us because they remind us of our connection to nature. We are fascinated by their ability to fly, sing, and be free. This shows us what it means to be human. 
In recent years, birds have become a warning sign for environmental problems. If birds are in danger, it's a sign that our planet is in trouble. 
Some birds, like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing, have special meanings in our culture. They represent love, romance, and magic. If we lose these birds, we lose a part of our culture. 
Folklore is important because it helps us understand our connection to nature and to the birds. It's like a language that connects us to the past and helps us understand the present. 
When we watch birds, we feel a connection to something bigger than ourselves. We can't always explain why, but it's like birds are trying to tell us something. The wren in the greenhouse is like a puzzle that keeps me wondering."

Maps are pictures that show how places and things are related to each other on the Earth's surface. They use distance and direction to show these relationships. A long time ago, people used to measure distance in hours or days, but this didn't give them much information about how far it was. Direction was also important, but for most people, it was more important to know where they were going and how far it was than to know exactly which way to go.
In the past, people used written guides instead of maps, especially for long journeys. Even today, some maps don't show directions very well. Important landmarks were marked on maps to help people find their way. The way maps are made changed over time as people learned more about the Earth and how to make more accurate maps.
Cartographers, the people who make maps, used science to help them make better maps. They used things like compasses and instruments to measure angles and distances. They also learned more about the Earth and its shape, which helped them make more accurate maps.
As time went on, people started using maps for different purposes, like for soldiers, archaeologists, and historians. Cartographers had to learn new ways to show different kinds of information, like where things are distributed. Today, maps are important for many sciences and are used to help us understand many things.
It's important to remember that maps are not always perfect and can be old or outdated. Many maps have been made over time, and they can be very useful for learning about the past."

Why is it that TV shows about art are not very good? Art and sculpture should be easy to show on TV because the camera can show the whole artwork and then zoom in on the details. But I can't think of many TV shows that do this well. A good example is a TV series about American art by Robert Hughes. He is a good critic and he had a lot of time to explain American art to British people. I thought the show would be about famous artworks, but instead it was about how American history and culture are shown in art and buildings.

This is a problem for the companies that benefit from cheap raw materials.

In London, there is a special place where people can build their own bikes using bamboo. James and Ian, two engineers, run this workshop. They design the bike frames on a computer and then help people build them over a weekend. This is a fun and unique way to make a bike.
Bamboo is a special material that is being used more and more in bike-making. It's strong, sustainable, and can make a bike very light. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for everyone, not just rich people. They spent years designing and testing their bikes before opening the workshop.
When you come to the workshop, you'll learn how to choose the right bamboo and build the frame. The instructors will help you every step of the way. They'll show you how to make strong joints and attach the bamboo pieces together. It's a bit tricky, but don't worry if you make mistakes - it's all part of the fun!
The bike you build will be unique and special. You can choose the color and design of the bamboo, and add your own personal touches. The finished bike is strong and durable, just like a metal bike. James and Ian have even tested their bikes and ridden them for thousands of miles without any problems.
The best part is that the bike is very affordable. You can build your own bamboo bike for under £500. James and Ian are happy to share their passion for bike-making with others and hope to inspire more people to make their own bikes."

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special primate called the aye-aye. It has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker. The aye-aye uses its teeth to gnaw into wood and its long finger to search for insect larvae. Scientists have been studying how the aye-aye finds its food. They wanted to know if it uses its eyes, nose, or ears to find the insects.
The scientists tested the aye-aye's hunting skills by giving it logs with holes. Some holes had mealworms inside, and others were empty. The aye-aye went straight to the holes with food, without looking at the surface of the log. The scientists thought maybe the aye-aye was using its sense of smell or hearing to find the mealworms, but it didn't use those senses either.
The aye-aye was able to find the mealworms even when the smell was blocked and the insects were silent. So, how did it find them? The scientists discovered that the aye-aye can sense the empty spaces in the wood. When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and uses its big ears to listen for the sound. It can also hear the insects moving when it taps the wood.
The aye-aye is a special animal that can be compared to a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat. It also behaves like a squirrel, as it has growing teeth like a squirrel and has been seen eating nuts in the wild.

Most people have old family photos, but do we really know what our grandparents were like when they were young? We might remember some stories from our family, but they are often not complete. We might also leave videos or recordings for our grandchildren, but they will only show us in two dimensions.
Hannah Renier has come up with an idea to help us learn more about our ancestors. She writes books about ordinary people's lives. Each book is at least 20,000 words long and includes pictures. She talks to the people she writes about and asks them to share their stories. This helps her to understand what they went through and what they learned.
Many people are surprised by what they remember when they talk about their past. They might remember things that hurt or made them sad, but they also learn things about themselves. They might see patterns in their life that they didn't notice before, like repeating mistakes or trying to impress someone.
Hannah Renier keeps her distance and doesn't try to pry into people's personal lives. She just wants to help them tell their stories honestly. She knows that people want to be honest and share their experiences, even if they are not perfect.
Each book takes a long time to make, with up to 30 hours of talking and writing. Hannah Renier uses technology to make the book look nice and professional. The final product is a high-quality book that people will treasure. It's not cheap, but it's worth it for people who want to learn about their family's history.
Hannah Renier gets about 10 inquiries a week from people who want to make a book about their lives. She hopes that more people will be interested in preserving their family's stories for future generations."

I have five children and I love being a father. This morning, I got to feed my youngest child and it reminded me of what being a father is all about. My children and I like the same things, like opera, theatre, and books. This makes us close. Sometimes I wasn't the best father, but I always tried to be available for them. I don't think it's good to hit children, but I did it when I was angry. Now I try to be a good friend to my children.
B. The advertising executive
I had my children when I was young, and it was a big change for me. It made me grow up quickly, but it also kept me young. My children introduced me to new things, like music and fashion. This helped me with my job. Sometimes I missed important events in their lives, like school concerts, but now I can take them on holidays.
C. The politician
I have been a father for a long time, and it's been hard to balance my work and family life. I make sure to have my children with me when I have meetings or public events, so they know what I do. This way, they don't feel left out.
D. The writer
I was a single father for a while, and it made me think about what it means to be a good father. I tried to stay close to my children, but maybe I was too easy-going with them. My daughter said I was always there for her, but maybe I wasn't the best father. I regret that now.
E. The TV presenter
I always wanted to have a child, and when I did, it changed me. Being a parent is a big responsibility, but it's also very special. Sometimes I get frustrated, but looking at my daughter's smile makes me forget everything."

'Flying in Space without Gravity
I, Tom Mumford, went on a special flight with 13 students from Europe and America. We were on a big plane called a Boeing KC-135. It looked like a normal plane, but inside it was different. There were no windows, and it was lit up with special lights. We sat down in the back, and some of us were a bit scared. We had been chosen to be on this flight because we had come up with good ideas for experiments in space.
The plane went up, up, up, and then down, down, down. This made us feel weightless for a few seconds. We floated around and had to hold onto things to stop ourselves from floating away. It was like being on a big trampoline!
We did some experiments during the flight. Some students studied how things move in space, while others looked at how to make special solar sails that can use the sun's light to move. It was a really cool experience.
After the flight, we felt happy and excited. One of the students said, ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want to even more!"" We all had a great time and will never forget our adventure in space.'"

I had a special experience in New Zealand. I went there every winter for nine years. My parents bought a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. They said we could have it if we planted trees on it. My dad was born in New Zealand, so it was a special connection for us.
I loved the idea of planting trees. I had worked on farms in Australia before, so I knew it would be hard work. But I was excited to do it. My family and I planted 70 acres of trees in three years. It was a lot of work, especially in the rain. We had to get up early every morning, put on our wet clothes, and start planting.
It was a great experience. I learned a lot about working hard and taking care of the land. I also started thinking about the natural world and our place in it. I've been back to New Zealand four times to see how the trees are growing. It's been great to see them grow and thrive.
Now, I'm a bit worried when I read about bad weather in New Zealand. But overall, it was a great experience, and I'm proud of what we accomplished. I even wrote a book about it called Seeing Green."

We have a special farm where we take care of orphaned animals. One day, we got a call to help some badger cubs. They were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. The mother badger was dead, and the cubs were cold and hungry. We took them in and fed them with a special bottle. We had to clean them first to make them feel comfortable. The cubs, Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow, were very small and needed to be fed every few hours. We soon realized that Willow was not doing well, and sadly, he died. We were very sad, but we continued to care for the other two cubs.
A few days later, we got another call to help another badger cub, Willow II. He was also orphaned and very hungry. It took some time to feed him, but eventually, he started to eat on his own. We also started giving them solid food, like cereal and fruit.
As the cubs grew, they became more active and started to play. They would chase each other and even play with us. We would go for walks with them at night, and they would get excited and chase each other's tails. We had to be careful not to get caught!
As the summer got hotter, the cubs started to dig and search for food. We saw other badgers in the area, and we knew they were looking for food too. We built a special home for the cubs, with tunnels and a big enclosure. The cubs loved it and would explore it before going on their walks.
Eventually, the cubs were big enough to move into their new home. We would visit them sometimes, and they would still come to say hello. They have grown up and are now living in their own territory."

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer. Halley is known for discovering a comet, but he also did important work on navigation. He wanted to find out how the compass works. Without this knowledge, sailors couldn't find their way across the ocean.
Halley went on a long journey to measure the compass variations. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, and other places. He wrote a book about his findings, which helped sailors for many years. But his work became less accurate over time because the Earth's magnetic field changed.
Dr. Clark wants to remember Halley's journey and update his findings. He plans to sail the same route as Halley, but with better instruments. He will measure the compass variations and help scientists understand the Earth's magnetic field. This is important because it can help us navigate the oceans.
Dr. Clark is a keen sailor and has spent time in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life and was inspired by his story. He thinks Halley was a remarkable person who did many important things. Dr. Clark wants to honor Halley's memory and do something meaningful. He is willing to spend eight months at sea to make this happen.

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in England show off their beautiful tails to the hens. The hens look at the peacocks and choose the ones with the most beautiful tails. This is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How do the peacocks get away with having such beautiful tails?
A long time ago, a scientist named Charles Darwin thought that animals became the way they are because of a process called evolution. He believed that animals with the best features were more likely to survive and have babies. But the peacocks' tails don't seem to be very useful. They are heavy and make it hard for the peacocks to run away from predators.
Another scientist, Alfred Wallace, thought that the hens might like the peacocks' tails because they are beautiful. He believed that the hens could see something in the peacocks that we can't.
Now, scientists are trying to figure out why the hens like the peacocks' tails. They are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade and have found that the hens really do like the peacocks with the most beautiful tails. The peacocks with the most beautiful tails have more eye-spots on their tails, and the hens like that.
Some scientists think that the peacocks with the most beautiful tails might be healthier or stronger than the others. They are studying the babies of the peacocks with the most beautiful tails to see if they grow faster or are healthier.
There is one more idea that scientists are exploring. They think that the hens might have started liking the peacocks' tails because one hen picked a peacock with a slightly better tail than the others. The sons of that peacock would have inherited his tail, and the daughters would have inherited the mother's preference for long tails. Over time, the peacocks with the longest tails would get more mates and have more babies, and the hens would prefer longer and longer tails.
This is a complex problem, but scientists are working to figure out why the hens like the peacocks' tails."

MY BOAT, THE WESTERMAN
I think a good boat should combine old and new ideas. I built my own boat, the Westerman, with this idea in mind. It's a special boat that looks like it's 100 years old, but it has modern technology too.
Most new boats are like the ones you see at the boat show in London. They have many new features, but they are not as good as my boat. My boat was designed last year, but it looks like it's been around for a long time. It has a special charm that makes me feel happy.
I think it's important to have a boat that is simple and easy to use. My boat has a stove for cooking and warm sleeping quarters. It's not too fancy, but it's perfect for sailing.
I used to have another boat called Hirta. It was old and didn't have many modern features, but it was a great boat. I sailed it around Britain and it was very kind to me.
When I got hurt, I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a new boat, but I couldn't find one that was right. So, I decided to build my own boat from scratch. The Westerman is my new boat, and it's perfect for me.
The designer, Nigel Irens, drew the plans for the boat on a napkin and then used a computer to make it perfect. The boat is made of wood and has a special glue that makes it waterproof. It's like a glass fibre boat, but it looks and feels like a real wooden boat.
I'm very happy with my boat, and I think it's the best boat for me."

Shrubland Hall is a big old house with a calm and relaxing atmosphere. When I arrived, I had a medical check-up. They found a problem with my shoulder and helped me with exercises to fix it. They also gave me a special diet to follow. The food is nice, but if you're not eating much, you might get a little hungry. You can have massages and water therapy every other day.

The food is delicious, but if you're watching your weight, you might want to choose healthier options. They have a gym, pool, and spa facilities. They also have a sports injury clinic, which helped me with my shoulder problem.

We are very similar to chimpanzees. In fact, we are 98% identical to them. This means that any differences between us and animals are very recent. Our bodies and brains are slightly different, but not much. We think that art is something that makes us special, but is it really?
Some animals, like chimpanzees, make tools and use them to help them survive. They even use sticks to eat and fight. Some monkeys have a simple language with different sounds for different things, like ""leopard"" or ""snake"". This makes us wonder what makes human art different.
We used to think that humans were the only ones who made art, but now we know that animals do too. For example, some animals use rocks to open shells and eat the food inside. They even make art for fun, like painting and drawing.
We used to think that human art was special because it was made for beauty and not for a specific purpose. But some animals make art for fun too. They don't make it to help them survive or to communicate with others, they just make it because they enjoy it.
We also thought that human art was special because it was learned and not instinctive. But some animals learn to make art too. For example, some birds learn to sing songs that are passed down from their parents.
In the end, it's hard to say what makes human art truly unique. Maybe it's just that we humans have a special way of making art that is different from animals. But even that is not clear."

The group wanted to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert, but it was a big challenge.
Charles Blackmore was in the army for 14 years, but he wanted to do something different. He wanted to see who he was outside of the army. His wife was worried that he wouldn't come back, but they went ahead anyway. It took them 59 days to cross the desert.
The group had many problems, like dysentery, extreme heat and cold, and not enough water. But they were lucky and found some water when they needed it. They didn't have any help, and they had to work very hard to survive.
Charles Blackmore was very scared at the beginning, but he kept going. He wanted to survive and make it to the end. When they finally finished, he felt very proud of himself. He thought about his family and how happy they were, and that made him feel even prouder.

I thought about how we all love technology because it makes our lives easier and gives us more time to do other things. But I realized that technology can also be a problem. I had a bad experience with a broken word processor that cost me a lot of money to fix. This made me wonder if we really need all these gadgets.
I started to get rid of some of the technology in my home. I stopped using my washing machine and started washing clothes by hand. I also stopped watching TV and started doing other things like reading, talking, and playing with my dog. I even started sewing by hand again. I used to think that sewing was boring, but now I enjoy it. I can listen to the radio or talk to my family while I sew.
I like sewing because it helps me relax and feel more in control. I don't have to rush to finish one task to start another. I can take my time and enjoy the process. I also like doing the washing up by hand because it's a quiet and peaceful activity.
I started thinking about all the other things I could do without. Do I really need a freezer or a microwave oven? Could I save money by not using electric lights?

People sleep a lot. It's clear that sleep is important. But what it does is still a mystery. Scientists don't agree on why we sleep so much. There are three main ideas about this. One idea is that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. It's like our bodies are fixing any problems they made during the day while we sleep. Another idea is that sleep helps us learn new things. This theory says that our brains work while we sleep to help us remember what we learned during the day. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to learn. The third idea is that sleep helps us have energy for the next day. It's like our bodies need to recharge like a battery to have enough energy to do things.

Eccentrics are people who do things that are not normal. But what is normal? We all have things that make us different from others. Maybe you like collecting stamps or playing a special game. These things make us who we are.
Inside us, there are two forces. One is the desire to be like everyone else and the other is the desire to be different. Most of the time, the force that wants to be like everyone else is stronger. We want to be accepted and liked by others.
People who are different often find others like them. They join clubs or groups to talk about their interests. They like being with others who understand them.
We all have a mix of these two forces inside us. Sometimes we want to fit in and sometimes we want to stand out. We might say things like ""I am who I am"" or ""I do what I want"". But we can also choose to be more ourselves and be different.
Some people become famous by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous singer, said that if you do what you love and don't give up, you will be different. But being eccentric is not just about doing something unusual. It's about being natural and not caring what others think. Eccentrics are not trying to be odd, they just are. They do what they do because it's who they are.

DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS? We asked five big book publishers in Britain about how important book reviews are for selling books. Here's what they said.
Publisher A Reviews are very important for us. Many people buy books because of good reviews. Authors and publishers both want good reviews, but authors are more upset if they get bad reviews. Publishers think that even bad reviews can help sell books because they make people curious.
Publisher B Book reviews are important for newspapers and magazines. They want to make their readers happy. But publishers want to see their own books reviewed, especially if they are good books. Some book reviews are better than others. There are still many books that don't get reviewed, especially paperbacks.
Publisher C Reviews are very important for us. We need them to help people know about our books. We don't advertise much, so reviews are important. Good reviews can help sell books, especially if they are written by famous reviewers.
Publisher D It's hard to understand how reviews affect book sales in Britain. Sometimes, good reviews don't help, and bad reviews don't hurt. Some books that get bad reviews sell well, and some books that get great reviews don't sell at all.
Publisher E Nobody wants bad reviews, but do they really help sell books? I published a book once, and the reviews were amazing, but the book didn't sell well. People thought they didn't need to buy the book because they had already read the reviews. Does it matter who writes the review? Some reviewers are more important than others, but nowadays, it's not just about who writes the review, but also how interesting and original it is.

At the beginning of the year, Evans was having a tough time. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about money. He had been without a job for two years, and the bank manager was getting impatient. Instead of getting a job, Evans decided to take a big risk. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.
The idea for the book came from a man he met on a trip to Dartmoor. The man told him about a horse that had become very aggressive, but a gypsy was able to calm it down just by talking to it. Evans was fascinated by this story and decided to write a book about it.
Evans drove across America, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He was alone and felt like his life was falling apart. He had tried to make a career as a film-maker for 10 years, but it wasn't working out.
When he got back home, Evans wrote the first half of the book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent, and he thought it was good. The agent said Evans might get $30,000 as an advance on the book. Evans was hoping to get enough money to pay off some debts and keep his family going.
Evans sent the book to seven publishers, and within a week, one of them offered him $75,000. The book was then sold to two big publishers for a record-breaking amount of money. Evans was amazed and didn't know how it happened.
The book became a huge success, and Evans became a famous author. He was offered a lot of money to make the book into a film, but he decided not to do it. He wanted to keep writing his own books and not become an employee of the film company."

Volunteering can bring people together and help solve problems. It can also help people understand each other better. But if only rich people from rich countries do this, it won't help the people who really need it. It will just help the rich people get ahead.
Some people think that volunteering is a good way to help others. But it can also be a way for rich people to feel good about themselves. They might think they are helping, but they are not really changing the situation. We need to think about how we can really help people, not just feel good about ourselves.

We wake up to the sound of the radio in the morning. But how do we choose a good one? Our team tested five different clock radios. One model had a special feature called a ""dual alarm function"". This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. But it's not very useful because not many people need to wake up at different times on different days.
This model is good because it has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite music or a soothing tape before you go to sleep. The radio sounds good too. But the clock radio is quite big and takes up a lot of space.
Another model was the favorite of our team. It has a digital display and a snooze button that is easy to use. The clock has a special feature that keeps working even if the power goes out. This was a good thing for us because we didn't have to reset the clock.
However, setting up this model was a bit tricky. It took us some time to figure it out, but we felt proud of ourselves when we did. One person thought the clock was a bit ugly, but the others liked its bright colors.
A third model was very popular. It's the cheapest of all the models we tested, but it's also the simplest. It has an old-fashioned dial to tune the radio, which some people prefer. The radio sounds good and the alarm works well.
Overall, we liked the different features of each clock radio. We thought about what was important to us, such as space, ease of use, and good sound quality."

""Hedgehogs are small animals with sharp spines all over their bodies. They live in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. When they feel scared, they roll into a ball to protect themselves. This works well if they have many spines, but if they have fewer spines, they might try to run away and only roll up if they can't escape. Hedgehogs are usually awake at night and sleep during the day. They like to sleep in bushes or in holes in the ground. Some hedgehogs can sleep all winter, but others stay awake all year round if they have a good place to live.""

""Great female athletes are doing well. It's not easy to be a good athlete, even for men. But women have to work even harder. They don't have much time for a normal life, so they have to make sacrifices. But they are still doing well. We talked to five amazing British female athletes who are achieving their goals.
A. Jill, a skier, says, ""It's a great feeling to ski fast and land safely. Sometimes it's scary, but I just keep going. It's hard to have a job outside of skiing because I train for 10 months a year. I miss my social life and friends, but it was my choice.
B. Caroline, a cyclist, says, ""I started cycling two years ago. I won a race and was surprised because I had never cycled before! I'm paid well as a professional cyclist and I get many opportunities for endorsements. But sometimes I worry that people think I'm only good because I'm pretty, not because I'm a good cyclist.
C. Annabel, a rower, says, ""It's hard for girls to get into rowing because not many girls' schools do it. So, most girls start rowing late and it's harder to be good at it. But I love being fit and I have a good social life.
D. Ffyona, a long distance walker, says, ""I always wanted to walk around the world. I started when I was 13. Each walk has been different. The hardest one was walking across Australia. I was tired and had many blisters, but I did it and got a record!
E. Lisa, a car racing driver, says, ""Some men are very competitive and arrogant. When I do well, they don't talk to me. It's hard to make money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Many women are now racing and it's great to see.
F. Alison, a triathlete, says, ""I swim, cycle, and run every day. It's hard and I sometimes feel tired. But I love being fit and I'm happy when I'm doing it. It's also very social.""

'I was 18 years old and traveling around Europe and Morocco in a old van. I was running out of money, so I got a job painting boats on the waterfront. One day, I saw Picasso, a famous artist, eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. I was surprised because he was a private person who usually stayed away from people. I was shy, but my friend encouraged me to go talk to him. I showed him my sketchbook and he signed it. Then, he drew a picture on the page. I was amazed and happy.
After that, I went back to my friend and showed him the signature. He said I should go back and draw Picasso's portrait. I was nervous, but I went back and started drawing. Picasso started making funny faces and acting like a clown. He wanted to see how serious I was about drawing. I was determined to finish the portrait, and eventually, he stopped making faces and let me draw him normally. When I finished, he looked at it and nodded. Then, he drew a portrait of me! I was surprised and happy. He signed the drawing, but only after I asked him to. I was grateful for the experience and felt lucky to have met Picasso.'

**Buying and Shopping**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more things than you planned to? Stores use special tricks to make us buy more. Let's look at some of these tricks.
**Fresh and Nice Smells**
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance to make us feel good. They also bake bread in-store to make it smell delicious. The color of the store can also help. For example, green is a fresh color.
**Where to Put Things**
Where things are placed in a store is important. Supermarkets use computers to see which areas people visit most often. They put popular and expensive items in these areas.
**Traps and Temptations**
Some stores put low-priced items far from the entrance. We have to walk past other items to get to them. This makes us see more things and buy more. Some stores also put their best products far from the entrance, so we have to look for them.
**How Stores Look**
Some stores make their products look special by putting them in small groups. This makes us feel like we're getting something exclusive. Some stores also use big displays to show us what we can buy.
**How Much We Pay**
Supermarkets mix low-priced and high-priced items to make us think we're getting a good deal. They might even sell some items at a loss to get us to come into the store. This is called a ""loss leader"".
**Pricing**
Some stores are very careful about prices. They want us to notice if something is cheaper than usual. They also use prices to make us feel like we're getting a good deal.
**Lighting**
Stores use lighting to make us see things clearly. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh food look good. Chainstores use lighting to make clothes look like they do in natural light.
**Paths and Carpets**
Some stores divide their floors with different carpets. This makes us walk along a path and look at the things they want us to see. Some stores use wood or marble for the path to make us feel welcome.
**Advertising**
When we enter a supermarket, we see big pictures of food that looks delicious. Some stores are even testing special shopping carts with screens that show us ads as we shop. This is to make us buy more things on impulse.

Chris Bonnington is a famous mountaineer. He climbed Mount Everest in 1985. Robin Knox-Johnston is a sailor. He sailed around the world alone in 1968-1969. Chris and Robin are friends. They went on a trip together to Greenland. They sailed and climbed in the mountains. They wrote a book about their adventure.
I met Robin when I was working on a book about adventure. He asked me to join him on his boat. I showed him how to climb, and he showed me how to sail. We had a great time. Robin was very good at climbing, even though he had never done it before. He was steady and calm.
We went to a big mountain in Greenland. It was very difficult to climb. Robin was worried about the boat, but he still wanted to climb the mountain. I was worried about Robin's safety, but he was very brave.
We had a few problems on the way back to the boat. Robin didn't wake me up for my shift, and I felt he didn't trust me. But he said I was wrong, and we talked it out. After our trip, I realized that Robin is a kind and sensitive person, not just a tough sailor.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. But some people are worried that we are losing the variety of apples. 
A long time ago, people ate apples and threw away the seeds. They planted these seeds and grew new apple trees. In ancient times, people in Switzerland and Italy grew apples and dried them to eat in the winter.
In the Middle Ages, people in Europe learned how to grow apples from the Romans. They brought new apple varieties to Britain and grew them in monasteries. The monks experimented and created new apples.
In the 13th century, many types of apples became popular in Britain. One type, called the Old English Pearmain, was eaten as a dessert. Another type, called the Costard, was used for cooking.
Apples were popular in Britain, but then there were many problems like droughts, wars, and diseases. Fewer apples were grown, and more were brought from other countries. 
In the 16th century, a man named Henry VIII wanted to learn about growing apples from the French. He sent a man to France, and they brought back new apple varieties.
When people traveled to new countries, they took apple seeds with them. They planted these seeds and grew new apple trees. In North America, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees.
In the 19th century, a farmer in Iowa found a new type of apple growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named it the Delicious apple. It became very popular and is still grown today.
Another famous apple variety was discovered by a woman named Maria Smith in Australia. She found a small tree growing in a pile of rubbish and transplanted it. The tree grew and produced green apples that became famous all over the world.
Today, apples are grown all over the world. But many apples are grown in the same way and have the same taste. This is a problem because it means we are losing the variety of apples. We need to make sure that we protect the diversity of apples and other foods for the future."

Richard Nerurkar is a famous long-distance runner from Britain. He visited Kenya, where many top runners train. Kenya is a country near the equator. Richard went to a special place called Nanyuk, which is 10 miles south of Nairobi. It's a beautiful but quiet place. Richard had never trained with Kenyan runners before, but this time he was invited to join them.
Richard went to the Kenyan national team training camp. It's a place where the best Kenyan runners prepare for big races. The coach invited Richard because he finished fifth in a big race in the World Championship. Richard was excited to train with the Kenyans and learn their secrets.
The Kenyans train at high altitude, which helps them run better. Richard also ran a race in Kenya, which was the first international cross-country race on African soil. Many Kenyan runners finished ahead of him, but Richard thought he had a good race.
The Kenyans are known for their simple way of training. They don't make it complicated. They run three times a day, with a big run in the morning, some interval training, and another run in the afternoon. They also eat simple food like ugali, stew, and tea.
Richard stayed with the Kenyans for a week and learned that their success is not just because of their altitude or genes. He thinks it's because they have a simple and pure way of living, with hard work and a love for running.

Advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic recession. Advertising has been in trouble for a long time. The problem is that advertisers are not very good at reaching the right people with their messages.
Most people don't buy many new things every year. We buy some food, clothes, and maybe a new phone or computer. But we don't buy many different brands. In fact, most of us only buy a few hundred brands in a year. But there are thousands of brands advertised every year.
This means that most advertisements are not very effective. People don't pay attention to most ads, and they don't buy the products they advertise. In fact, most people don't even remember the ads they see.
Advertising is a way to reach many people at the same time. But it's not very good at reaching the right people. Advertisers want to reach people who will buy their products, but they can't know for sure who will respond to their ads.
Some advertisers are trying to do better by targeting their ads to specific groups of people. This helps them reach the people who are most likely to buy their products. But even with this, they can't be sure who will respond to their ads.
The best way to advertise is to find the right people and talk to them directly. This is what salespeople do when they sell things face-to-face. But with advertising, it's harder to know who will respond.
Some advertisers are very good at reaching a small number of people and getting them to buy their products. But most advertisers are not very good at this. They need to do better if they want to be successful.

**The Greenest House in Britain**
I visited a special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. It's called the ""autonomous house"". The house is very green, which means it doesn't harm the environment. The owners, Robert and Brenda Vale, designed and built the house themselves. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and recycle their waste into compost for their garden. They also use the heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat to warm the house.
The house looks like a normal house from outside, but it's very special inside. It's very quiet because it's well-insulated and has special windows that keep out noise. When you enter the house, you have to take off your shoes because it's very quiet. The house is warm and cozy, even in winter. The Vales use a small wood-burning stove to heat the house, but they don't use it much.
The house is special because it doesn't use much electricity or water. The Vales don't pay any water bills, and they only use a little bit of electricity. They are going to install solar panels soon, which will make them even more energy-independent. The house is also very low-tech, which means there's not much that can go wrong.
The Vales are very proud of their green house and want to show others that it's possible to live in a house that doesn't harm the environment. They wrote a book about green architecture and want to inspire others to build similar houses.

Arthur Conan Doyle was a famous writer who created the character Sherlock Holmes. He thought he was a rational person who liked science. In 1920, he saw some photos of fairies taken in a garden. He believed these tiny creatures really existed. He wrote an article and published the photos. Later, in 1939, the two ladies who took the photos told the truth. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them among flowers. The photos are very nice, but the trick is simple. It shows that the camera is not always honest. We can now use computer software to change our digital photos. This means that photography has never been completely honest. Since cameras started taking pictures, people have been changing reality.

Blacksmiths have been important for a long time. They make things from iron, like tools and weapons. In the past, people thought blacksmiths were very skilled and important. They were like doctors and astrologers. They made beautiful ironwork for buildings like St Paul's Cathedral.
In the past, blacksmiths were not needed as much because machines took over their jobs. But now, people are interested in decorative architecture and design again. This means blacksmiths are needed to make things like gates, balconies, and decorative items.
There is a group called the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) that wants to promote the blacksmiths' craft. They are having an exhibition at a gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. The exhibition shows many different ironwork pieces, like bookends, a spiral staircase, and more. The prices range from £90 to over £1,000.
The blacksmiths who made these pieces are very creative and like working with iron. They say it's a challenging material, but also very rewarding. One blacksmith says it's like drawing with metal in space. Another blacksmith likes that iron is soft when it's hot, but hard when it's cold.
Iron has been important for a long time, and it will probably continue to be important for a long time. As long as people like decorative items and want to use iron, blacksmiths will be needed."

I stopped smoking one day, but my colleague was very angry. She said, ""Why didn't you stop smoking years ago if it was so easy?"" I couldn't explain why I was able to stop smoking so quickly. I went to a stop-smoking session with a group of people. We did some therapy and hypnosis together. I didn't want to stop smoking, but I went to the session to write an article about other people who were trying to quit. I told the counselor that I wasn't going to try to stop smoking because I was only there to write about it. The counselor looked at me strangely. We were allowed to smoke during the session, and most of the time we spent in a room filled with smoke. I noticed that when we were told to smoke, I didn't want to do it, and neither did the others. I think what happened was that the idea of not smoking started to seem attractive. It felt good to think about not being a smoker. It was a secret feeling that was just between me and myself. Stopping smoking was easy. I didn't feel the need to smoke after a few days. I thought it would be hard to work without cigarettes, but it wasn't a problem. The only thing that was hard was doing nothing on weekends. I miss smoking sometimes, but not too much. Now I have to think about what to do in situations where I used to smoke, like eating out or waiting for a plane.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a very important prize called the Nobel Prize. She is not well-known in the UK, even though she was the only British woman to win this prize. I am writing a book about her life and I want to tell people why she is important. 
When I talk to friends and family about my book, they often don't know who Dorothy Hodgkin is. They might say ""Isn't there already a book about her?"" But there isn't. She was a remarkable person who lived through many big changes in the world, like women's education and science becoming global. 
Some people think that scientists' lives are boring, but that's not true. Scientists are people too, with families and personal lives. Dorothy Hodgkin was a dedicated scientist who worked hard to solve important problems in medicine. She also had a family and was married to a historian. 
It's surprising that scientists don't have more biographies written about them. Some people think that science is too complicated for ordinary people to understand, but that's not true. Science is like learning a new language or reading a book - it just takes time and effort. 
It's sad that many people don't know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they are very important. I hope that my book will help change this."

The stick is a forked hazel stick, and Margaret holds it above the ground. When she is above water, she feels a strange feeling and the stick moves. She uses this feeling to find the exact spot where the water is. Her husband also uses the stick, and they usually agree on where to drill.
Margaret says that everything in the world vibrates, including water. She thinks that she can sense these vibrations with her stick. Some people think that dowsing is a special kind of intuition.
Margaret is very good at finding water, and she has a long waiting list of customers. She usually finds water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She makes sure that the water is clean and safe to drink.
Margaret uses a pendulum to help her find water on big areas like golf courses. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over a map. When it swings, it means there is water underneath. Then she uses the stick to find the exact spot where the water is.
Margaret is not the only one who can do this. There are many other people who can find water using a stick. Scientists are still trying to understand how it works.

**What Makes a Good Leader?**
A good leader is someone who inspires others and helps them to achieve their goals. It's not about being tall or smart. A good leader is someone who can motivate others and make things happen.
**Becoming a Leader**
You don't have to be born a leader. You can develop your leadership skills by recognizing your talents and using them. Many people have the potential to be leaders, but they don't realize it.
**The Best and Worst Bosses**
Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. The best boss motivated you and gave you support. The worst boss made you feel like you were just a small part of the team and didn't tell you what was going on.

Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create their own goals. A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a company and make it successful.

I'm 34 years old and I've left my job to go backpacking. I'm a bit nervous because I've been working for a long time and it's a big change. I've done some traveling before, but this time I want to do it on my own. I'm worried about making the necessary arrangements, like finding someone to take care of my flat while I'm away. I'm also worried about being away from my friends and family.
Many people my age are taking a break from their jobs to travel. Some do it to get away from a bad relationship or a job they don't like. Others do it to have an adventure and experience new things. Some people even take a year off to travel around the world.
I'm not sure if I'm running away from something or running towards something. I'm excited to have this opportunity, but I'm also a bit scared. I'm worried about leaving behind my comfortable routine and saying goodbye to my friends and family.
I'm not alone in this feeling. Many people my age are taking a break from their jobs to travel and have an adventure. It's a chance to reassess their lives and think about what they really want. For me, it's a chance to grab life by the horns and do something I've always wanted to do.

I used to work as a journalist, but I took a break from my job. When I turned 37, I realized I needed to get back to work quickly. I looked at my old CV and saw that I was very out of date. I didn't know how to use a computer, and most jobs required experience with computers. I felt like I was stuck in the 1980s.
I was the only one in my family who didn't know how to use a computer. Even my children were more computer-savvy than me. But then we won a competition and got a computer package, which included a laptop and a personal computer. We started using the computer and learned new things like ""cyberspace"" and ""surfing the internet"". We even chatted with people from all over the world.
I set up a small office in my kitchen and started working from home. I was a bit worried about making mistakes, but it was easy to learn. I started writing articles for a magazine and was happy to be working again.
The computer has helped me a lot. I used to lose important papers and forget things, but now I can keep track of my work and finances easily. I can also research stories and talk to other journalists online.
Working from home has its advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes I feel lonely, and it can be hard to balance work and family life. But many people are doing the same thing, and it's becoming more common.
According to a report, most people who work from home are well-educated and have a computer. I'm doing well, and who knows, maybe one day I'll be publishing my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless!"

The Tartan Museum is a new museum in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has a unique and modern design, but the question is: will the things inside be as interesting? Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened. The museum is easy to find, with its big yellow building and tower.
People had different opinions about the building when it was first built. Some liked it, while others didn't. Now that the museum is almost ready to open, people are curious about what's inside. The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history, but it's not just about the past. It's also about the present and the future.
The museum's director, Dr. David Clarke, wants visitors to have a pleasant experience. He wants people to enjoy looking at the objects and learning about them. The museum has many interactive displays, but it's not too much. The museum also has a special area for children, where they can play and learn.
One of the galleries is temporary and will change every three years. It's about the most important things in Scotland's history in the 20th century. Some people chose things like electric guitars and televisions, while others chose toys and other everyday objects.
Dr. Clarke thinks that objects can help us learn more about the past than anything else. As for the museum's design, it's nice from the inside and the top, but some people might not like its location.

Newspapers are changing. This change can be scary for some people. But it's not always a big change. Sometimes, newspapers move from one place to another. For example, from print to the internet. This change is not always easy. Some people think that newspapers will stop printing and only be on the internet. But this is not true.
Many people still read newspapers. In fact, some people are reading more newspapers than before. They read them on their computers or phones. Some people like to read both print and digital newspapers. This is good for newspapers because it means they can make more money.

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with someone in it is usually more interesting than one without. But people can be hard to photograph well. You need to think about their actions, gestures, and expressions.
**GROUP SHOTS**
When taking a group picture, don't make everyone stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. You can also ask some people to sit or kneel in front so everyone's face is visible.
**POSING FOR PICTURES**
People often don't act naturally in front of a camera. They might look stiff and uncomfortable. Try to relax them by suggesting they do something natural, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**THE RIGHT APPROACH**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can make people feel tense or even angry. Most people are happy to have their picture taken and might even feel flattered. But they might become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them.
**EYE CONTACT**
A picture is more interesting if the person is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, not just smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture.
**CANDID SHOTS**
An alternative is to have the person focus on something in the picture. This can make the viewer feel like they're observing the person without them knowing.
**EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**
A person's expression and gestures can tell us more about them than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiling, laughing, or frowning.
**SITUATION INTEREST**
A picture with a interesting background can add more interest to the subject. Try to make the subject stand out by using a wide-angle lens or focusing on them.
**INTERACTION**
Pictures of people interacting with each other, like talking, arguing, or playing, can be very interesting. Look for eye contact or physical contact between the subjects.
**PEOPLE AND PLACES**
When taking pictures of people in a new place, try to show them against the background. Use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to get the whole scene in the frame.
**TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a good clear picture, ask the subject to pose against a nice background. But if you want a more natural picture, try to take it when the subject is not expecting it."

**The Key to Success: Emotional Intelligence**
The way we work is changing. We're not just judged on how smart we are or how well we do our job. Now, we're also judged on how well we get along with others and how we handle our emotions.
This is important because it helps us decide who will be good at their job and who won't. It's also important for our future careers. We don't need to be book smart to be good at our job. We need to be good with people.
We used to think that being good at school was the most important thing. But now, it's not enough. We need to be able to work well with others, be kind, and understand each other's feelings. This is called emotional intelligence.
Emotional intelligence is important because it helps us work well with others. It's not just about being nice, but also about being honest and fair. We need to be able to control our emotions and use them to make good decisions.
More and more companies are realizing that emotional intelligence is important. They want their employees to be good with people and to work well together. This is especially important in jobs that are complex and require teamwork.
The good news is that emotional intelligence can be learned. We can get better at handling our emotions and working with others as we get older and learn from our experiences. This is called growing up and becoming more mature.
Emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success. But if we ignore it, we won't be as successful as we could be."

**Ancient Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture**
Acupuncture is a 2,000-year-old treatment from traditional Chinese medicine. It helps people feel better from pain and other health problems. Doctors in the West use it to treat many conditions, especially back pain, arthritis, and headaches.
**What is Acupuncture?**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that our body has a special energy called Qi. When Qi flows properly, we feel healthy. But when Qi is blocked, we might feel sick or weak. An acupuncturist uses special needles to help Qi flow properly again.
**How Does it Work?**
The acupuncturist uses fine needles to insert into the skin. They might also use heat or pressure to help the Qi flow. People often feel a gentle ache or tingling sensation when the needle is inserted.
**What Types of Pain Can it Treat?**
Acupuncture can help with many types of pain, such as back pain, arthritis, headaches, and more. Some people even use it to help with menstrual cramps, facial pain, and pain from injuries.
**How Does it Work in Surgery?**
In China, acupuncture is used during some operations to help patients feel less pain. It's a new idea, but it's been used for over 50 years. Acupuncturists say it's a safe and effective way to reduce pain, with fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia.
**Is it Effective?**
Many people find acupuncture helpful, with 50-80% saying it works for chronic pain. Acupuncturists say it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and people respond differently to treatment.
**A Different Approach**
Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They ask about your lifestyle, habits, and feelings to understand the root of the problem. This is different from Western medicine, which often focuses on specific symptoms.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
When choosing an acupuncturist, make sure they are qualified and will refer you to a doctor if needed. Some acupuncturists follow traditional Chinese medicine, while others use scientific explanations. Either way, it's important to find a good acupuncturist to help you feel better."

The way we write can tell us a lot about ourselves. In some countries, people use handwriting analysis to learn more about someone's character. This is called graphology. Handwriting can show if someone has certain health problems, like heart disease or cancer. It can also show if someone is happy or sad.
Some companies use graphology to help them choose the right person for a job. They might look at how someone writes to see if they are honest or if they are good at their job. A graphologist is a person who studies handwriting to understand what it means.
Patricia Marne is a graphologist who has been doing this work for many years. She says that handwriting can show if someone is smart or not, and if they are good at art or science. She also thinks it can show if someone is a good or bad person.
Handwriting can also tell us if someone is likely to do something bad. For example, people who write in a certain way might be more likely to be dishonest. Some graphologists can even tell if someone is going to get sick or if they are feeling very sad.
But not everyone agrees that handwriting analysis is a good way to learn about people. Some doctors and psychologists think it's not very useful. They say that handwriting is just a way to write and it doesn't say much about who we are.

Office A: This office is very simple. There is no central heating or air conditioning, and the windows open directly onto the street. But the people who work here are happy. They are a small team and they work together. They make sure the office is comfortable by opening doors and using electric heaters. This might be the secret to their happiness.
Office B: This office is comfortable, but not very exciting. The air is good and the staff are happy. There is no smoking allowed. The chairs are good, but the office is a bit boring. The staff like the variety of their work and the flexibility of the office space.
Office C: This office is mixed. Some people like it, but others don't. The air is good, but the office is not very interesting. The staff are happy and supportive, and they have good technology. The office could be improved by making it more interesting and displaying more information.
Office D: This office is not a good place to work. The air-conditioning is bad, and the office is cluttered and dirty. The chairs are old and uncomfortable. The staff are stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to improve the office and make it a better place to work.

Chewing Gum Culture
Chewing gum is very popular in the United States. Americans chew 12 million sticks of gum every day! Did you know that chewing gum has been around for thousands of years? Let's find out how it became a big business.
Long ago, people chewed a sticky substance from the bark of a special tree called the mastic tree. Greek women liked to use it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Later, American colonists started chewing a resin that came from spruce trees. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the United States.
In the 1860s, a new type of chewing gum was discovered. It came from the sap of a tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more fun to chew. Soon, a whole industry was built around this new type of gum.
But making this gum is not easy. The people who collect the sap have to climb high trees in the rainforest and face many dangers, like snakes and insects. They also have to work in very hot and humid conditions.
As the demand for chewing gum grew, companies started making synthetic gum instead of using the natural sap. Today, most chewing gum is made from synthetic materials. The companies are always trying to come up with new flavors and textures.
Some people think that chewing gum is good for your teeth because it helps increase the flow of saliva, which can help prevent tooth decay. Researchers are still working on new ways to make gum better and more fun to chew.
Did you know that a lot of mint is grown in the United States to make the most popular chewing gums?"

Pelham was unhappy about the tree being gone. He liked the way it made the room look. Without it, the room seemed too bright and the old furniture looked worn out. He also didn't like the view from the window. The house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible and it was not very nice. Pelham thought it was ugly.
Molly told him that they should buy a new sofa to cover up the worn-out furniture. Pelham agreed."

We lived in a valley for 16 months before we realized how dangerous the surrounding hills could be. The year the storms came early, before winter had even started. We felt safe and protected in our valley, surrounded by hills. But then the snow started falling. It was deep and blocked our path and made the stream slippery. The wind was strong on the hills, but we only felt a few gusts in our valley. We knew we had to be careful because the river, the Ryburn, could become a problem. Normally, it flowed gently, but if the snow and rain kept coming, it could flood. We watched as the snow started to melt and the river began to rise. The clouds got darker and more twisted, warning us of what was to come. We kept an eye on the river, which got fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing. And then it happened - the reservoir burst and water poured into the stream. The river was furious, and it was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home. We were worried for three days, but luckily the dam held and the water went back down. Before the dam was built, the river used to flood the nearby villages. Now, the dam keeps the water back and we can enjoy the big clouds and the river's power without being afraid. Thanks to the dam, we feel safe in our valley.

I, Mark Adams, have been a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. Before this, I wrote reviews for other newspapers and magazines. I met my boss, Tom Seaton, who also worked in radio and TV. He hired me, but he wasn't a journalist. He wanted a team of critics to write about different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would meet for lunch and discuss what to write about. It was a dream come true to be part of a new newspaper. But the plan didn't work out as expected. We didn't work together as a team, and everything was done over the phone. The public preferred to see a reviewer specialize in one area, so I chose film. I like my job because I can write longer pieces about one film. It's not like other film critics who have to see every new movie. I don't think my role is to tell people what to watch. People usually choose movies based on the stars, the trailer, or the director. If someone doesn't like a certain type of movie, they won't change their mind because of a review. So, what's the point of a film review? I don't think I have to be right about a movie. I just need to share my opinion."

Do you know why some schoolgirls want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? It's because it's fun! A teenager who loves sports is looking for a training partner, preferably a girl. You'll need to be very good at running long distances (up to 15km), swimming long distances (and be able to train in cold water), and cycling long distances (up to 10km). You should be able to do all three activities without resting.
Triathlons are a popular Olympic sport. People watch athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. But why do they do it? One 17-year-old girl, Melanie Sears, doesn't just say it's for personal satisfaction or mental challenge. She loves it because it's fun!
Melanie started doing triathlons when she was 14. She won the junior competition, but then she realized it was too easy. She entered a bigger competition and didn't do as well. She was disappointed, but she didn't give up. She keeps training and is determined to never stop.
Melanie's coach, Steve Trew, is impressed with her hard work. He says she's very dedicated and will do her best, even when she's tired. Melanie wants to be the best, and she's willing to work hard to get there. She's even trying to convince her parents to buy her a new bike so she can train even more.
However, Melanie's training schedule is very demanding, and she doesn't have much time for social activities. She's not interested in talking about boys or clothes with her friends. She prefers to talk about their training times and goals.
Where will Melanie's dedication take her? She wants to enter even tougher events and is looking for someone her age to train with."

Many people collect things. I have always loved collecting too. One in three adults collects something. Collecting is a world of passion, excitement, and joy. But remember, if you don't love something, don't collect it. People have been collecting things for a long time. Even ancient people collected stones and shells because they liked their shapes and colors.
I have been collecting things all my life. I started with stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote place in England. My parents would take me to the local museum, and I loved looking at all the old objects on display. Many people collect things, and the reasons why are interesting. Some people collect because it's the only thing they can control. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing.
There are many famous collectors. One was a French prince who had a room full of strange and interesting objects. Another was a Russian queen who collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected things like tulip bulbs and china cups. I even searched for 350 American rag dolls, each one different. Unfortunately, my collection of dolls was destroyed in a fire. It was hard to see the remains of my collection.
What's interesting is how collections change hands and how some things become valuable because of who they belonged to. Old toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot of money if you still have the original boxes. I made a mistake by throwing away my old toys and their boxes!"

Four people talk about what they do. 
Lisa - Exhibition Coordinator at the Science Museum
I plan and organize temporary exhibitions. I read about the topic and talk to experts to decide what to show and how to show it. I make sure people can understand the idea behind the exhibition. I plan interactive activities and make sure everything is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design the brochures.
Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers
I work with students who want to become taxi drivers. I help them learn the routes in London. They practice finding the best way to get from one place to another. I help them when they disagree about the best route. When they are close to the test, I give them a new route and they have to find another way. This helps them think.
Sarah - Marine Conservationist
I work from home and help people learn about the ocean. I answer phone calls, make educational materials, and organize courses. Sometimes I go to our main office. I also work with schools and teach people who make decisions about the sea. I take them on boat trips to help them understand the ocean better. I love my job because I love the ocean, but sometimes we don't have enough money.
Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
I work on making maps and atlases. I make sure we publish the right books and have enough copies. We get many letters from readers who want to change something. I talk to other publishers about our projects and sales. I work with a happy team, but sometimes there is too much paperwork and not enough time for the fun parts of the job.

We always go to Ireland in June. For many years, we've spent the first two weeks of the month at a big house called Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. The house is near the sea and a small village called Ardbeag. A friend, Strafe, found the house for us. He saw an advertisement and showed it to us. We didn't like our previous holiday because the food was bad.
The four of us have been friends for a long time. Our names are Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I (my name is Milly, but most people call me that). We all live near each other and are around the same age.
When we arrived at Glencorn Lodge, Mrs. Malseed was waiting for us in the big hall. She always knows when we're coming. She showed us to our rooms, which have flower names like Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mr. Malseed, her husband, welcomed us with a big smile and said ""A hundred thousand welcomes"" in the Irish way.
We felt happy and relaxed. We knew that our holiday had started well. After dinner, we played cards for a bit, but then went to bed because we were tired from our journey. The next day, we would walk along the beach, have coffee in the village, and then go on a trip somewhere. This is what we usually do when we're at Glencorn Lodge.

Sarah is a 24-year-old from West Sussex who works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah loves her job because she meets new people every week. She wakes up at 7am and walks to the chalet, where she makes breakfast for the guests. They like to have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.
After breakfast, Sarah cleans the rooms or makes tea for the guests. She then goes skiing until 4:30pm. After dinner, she helps with the dishes and sometimes chats with the guests. Sarah likes to stay out with her friends until 11pm, but not on Sundays because she has to work early in the morning.

There was an old building in a lumberyard by a lake. The building was two stories high and surrounded by big piles of soft sawdust. One afternoon, some friends were bored and decided to go up to the roof. Michael, one of the friends, said, 'I dare you to jump down!' He jumped first and rolled around in the sawdust, laughing. The others were hesitant, but eventually they all jumped too.
After a while, they decided to do it again. But Michael was the only one left on the roof. He was scared, but he didn't want to admit it. He was thinking about jumping, but he couldn't do it. His friends were getting impatient and started to leave. Michael stayed on the roof for a long time, feeling sad and ashamed.
Eventually, he jumped down and lay in the sawdust for a while. When he got up, he went home. His stepmother was upset because he was late for dinner. She told him he was old enough to get home on time, and if he didn't, he should stay in. Michael was still feeling sad and didn't want to talk to anyone.

**Changing Your Job**
Are you not happy in your job? Do you want to change, but don't know how? You can talk to a careers adviser. They will ask you about your past and then give you some tests. The tests are like a quiz. They will tell you what jobs you might be good at and what skills you need to learn.
I went to a place called Career Analysts. I took the tests with a group of people. We had to answer questions quickly. It was like being in school again! I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The tests were hard, but they helped me understand myself better.
Then, I talked to an adviser. They looked at my results and told me what they thought I was good at and what jobs I might like. I was happy with most of what they said, but I was surprised that I didn't do well in some areas. I was glad to know that I made good choices about being a journalist.
You don't have to change your job completely. Donna Laney, a 25-year-old woman, lost her job as a marketing manager. She went to Career Analysts to help her figure out what to do next. She discovered that she had a talent for design. She decided to use her existing skills and move to a new job in public relations.
Other people have also found help at Career Analysts. Juliet Greene, a 26-year-old woman, was unhappy in her job at a bank. She went to Career Counselling Services and discovered that she was interested in science. She decided to start a degree course in geology.
Not everyone finds careers advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, didn't find it useful. She didn't like the suggestions because they required a lot of changes or a lower salary.
Remember, careers advice is not the same for everyone. You have to be open-minded and willing to listen to new ideas."

'Is the Dentist a Fun Place? When you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in Glasgow, you'll see nice paintings on the walls and a blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says many people only go to the dentist when they have a problem, not for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared. He wants to make people feel comfortable, so he doesn't wear a white coat. He thinks that makes people feel less scared. Jerome wants his patients to feel relaxed, interested, and happy. He even uses special machines that make you feel like you're watching a movie while he checks your teeth. The surgery smells nice, like a perfume shop, not like a dentist's office. Jerome is a serious dentist, but he also wants his patients to feel comfortable. He uses special tools to clean your teeth, and it doesn't hurt if you're relaxed. Jerome went to the United States to learn new techniques and found that making patients feel comfortable makes it easier for the dentist too. He wants to make dentistry a more friendly and relaxing experience for everyone.'

Chocolate is a popular food all around the world. It started in South America a long time ago. In the UK, people buy a lot of chocolate at Easter. In fact, they spend over £230 million on it! Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.
The cacao tree is a special plant that grows in many warm places. The fruit of the tree has 20-40 seeds inside. When the seeds are dried, they become cacao beans. These beans are used to make chocolate.
A long time ago, the Aztecs used cacao beans as money and to make a special drink called xocoatl. This drink was bitter and was often flavored with spices. The Spanish people liked it better when it was mixed with cinnamon and sugar.
In the 17th century, chocolate houses were popular in Europe. People would gather to drink chocolate. Later, a man from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate.
In the 19th century, a company in England called Fry and Sons created a solid chocolate bar. Then, a Swiss company added milk to the chocolate, making milk chocolate.
Now, many companies make chocolate bars. Some companies are trying new things, like making chocolate ice cream or chocolate soft drinks. But some cacao farmers are still struggling because the price of cacao beans went down a long time ago.
Next time you eat a chocolate bar, remember the people who grow the cacao beans."

They believe their mine could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. They have been digging in the Welsh hills and are finding high levels of gold.
The father and son team have been searching for gold for a long time. They started after the father read about gold in an old book. They chose a special area to dig and have been working hard to get permission to dig. They have spent their savings to make a tunnel and a deep hole.

When she's not teaching, she goes on a special vehicle to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to explore underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes are called ""black smokers"" because hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke.
The vehicle is small and has two pilots inside. They have to stay there for 16 hours, collecting samples of rock and water. If something goes wrong, they can press a button to get out quickly. The escape vessel goes up to the surface fast, like a ping-pong ball in a bath.

Losing your luggage at the airport is a frustrating experience. You might have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bag. This can happen even if you're in a different country with different weather. Airlines don't often tell us how many bags they lose, but it's a common problem.
Even good airlines make mistakes sometimes. It's hard to guarantee that your luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have a layover. Airlines have rules to make sure bags get on the right planes, but sometimes things go wrong.
At big airports, it's easy for bags to get mixed up. Last year, over 41 million people passed through London's Heathrow airport, and many of them were changing planes. Even small airports can have problems too.
If you're changing planes, try to choose a direct flight or check in early. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline and leave extra time between flights. Make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your name and address. If your luggage still goes missing, tell the airline official at the baggage claim and fill out a special form before you leave the airport.

He thinks they are very special.
Kingfishers have special feathers that make them look blue, but they don't actually have blue pigment. Instead, the way the light hits their feathers makes them look blue. This is why they can look different colors depending on the light. Charlie loves the colors of the kingfisher and the way they change.

We asked five families to visit different theme parks in Britain. We wanted to know which one is the best for families with children.
Fun Island was a surprise. We thought it would be boring compared to a big theme park in the US, but it was fun! The park has many rides for young children, so our three-year-old had a great time. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Big Wheel. There's a special ride for little kids, and older kids can go on scarier rides like Splash Out. The staff were very helpful and the park was clean and well-organized.
Wonderland was great for our family. None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. Our little boy, Oscar, loved the Mountain Train and Little Land, where he could play with small buildings. The older kids enjoyed the Ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We liked that there were places to rest and the staff were friendly.
Adventure World was a lot of fun. We spent seven hours there and still didn't see everything. The kids loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line. There's a special area for younger children, Toy Land, and a new ride called Fear Factor, but it was too scary for our kids. The park was very well designed and clean.
The Great Park was good for younger children because the rides weren't too scary. We all enjoyed Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We also liked Lightning River, but it was over too soon. If you're brave, you might like the Big Leap, but I was too scared!
Fantasy World was a lot of fun. There are many rides, including Europe's tallest roller-coaster. The kids loved it, but some of the staff were not very friendly. We needed a full day to see everything and wouldn't have wanted to leave early.""

Meet the Watkins Family
The Watkins family is very special. The two sons, Paul and Huw, are musicians. Their dad, John, makes instruments. This is not common. Usually, you find musicians who play instruments, but it's rare to find someone who makes them too.
When Paul was 10 years old, he wanted to play the cello. His parents, John and Hetty, looked for a cello, but it was very expensive. So, John thought, ""Why not make one myself?"" He took evening classes to learn how to make instruments. He made Paul's first cello, and it turned out well. Later, he made another one for Paul.
John now makes instruments full-time. He makes violins and sells them. One day, he even sold one to a famous musician. Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul started with the piano, and then he liked the cello better. Huw started with the piano too, but he liked it more. He didn't want to play the violin like his brother Paul.
Paul and Huw's parents were very supportive. They let them choose what they wanted to play. Paul is now 28 and plays the cello in a big orchestra. He won a big competition and became famous. Huw is 22 and writes music. He will play his music in a big concert hall soon.

The National Trust helps take care of the countryside in Britain. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and met Gareth, a warden who works for the Trust. He told me that to be a good warden, you need to use your common sense and be good with people.
Gareth grew up on a farm in the area and used to work with his parents. He got the job as a warden because of his local knowledge and farming experience. He didn't need special training.
Gareth likes that he can still work on his parents' farm and understand the problems of local farmers. He also knows how to do physical jobs like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working for the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation.
He used to collect flowers, butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests when he was a child. Now he realizes that farming has changed the countryside. He says that farmers and conservationists used to argue, but now they are working together.
Gareth's job is to make sure projects are finished quickly and at a low cost. He enjoys seeing projects finished, but sometimes he has to do paperwork and deal with difficult people. He likes his job, but sometimes it's hard to be nice to everyone.
If you like the outdoors and have common sense, you might want to apply to be a warden like Gareth. But there might not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time."

Meet Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. She's been preparing for the World Championships, which will take place next month. Kendra's days are busy - she teaches at a local school and then trains in a car park. She's very focused on her training and doesn't notice people watching her.
Kendra's goal is to be the best she can be for the Championships. She has a strict schedule to get fit for the big event. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet with 27 teams taking part.
Kendra is excited to have the support of the home crowd. She thinks it will be special to play in front of them. She also wants to improve the reputation of netball in England. The team is ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows it will be tough. She says that every day is a challenge, and they have to be ready to play their best.
Kendra has been playing netball for 15 years, and the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive now. But Kendra says that after the game, they are all friends again.
Kendra is also working on her fitness and mental attitude. She wants to be a good example for her teammates. She has planned her netball career carefully and knows that this will be her last big event. She might even coach young players in the future, but for now, she's focusing on the World Championships."

**Special Music Schools**
If your child is very good at music, it's not always easy to know how to help them develop their talent. Some parents might not notice their child's gift until they start to get frustrated or behave badly. Schools are usually good at helping children who are very good at other subjects, but music schools are special because they understand children who are very talented in music.
There are five special music schools in Britain. They are for children aged 7-18 who want to learn music with professional musicians. At these schools, children spend most of their day doing music activities like playing instruments, singing, and practicing with teachers. They also have some time for regular school subjects like English, maths, and languages.
The schools are small and have a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they can focus on their music and make friends with other children who love music.
However, there are some downsides. The schools are expensive, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year. Some parents might not want their children to go to boarding school, especially when they are very young. The schools also worry about the pressure on children who are very talented and might feel stressed or unhappy.
Some people think it's better to wait until children are a bit older before sending them to a special music school. This way, they can make their own decisions about their education. Others might do well in a regular school with a good music department or by taking music lessons on Saturdays.
But for families who live far from big cities, this might not be an option."

Susan Shepherd is a famous artist who loves to paint flowers. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, like tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are a bit wild and spread themselves around the garden. The garden has two long flower borders that are very colorful and well-organized. This is because the previous owners of the house loved gardening and left many plants behind.
Susan likes to focus on painting individual flowers rather than the whole garden. She often picks a flower, takes it to her studio, and paints it. It can take her a few days or even a couple of years to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times, when the tulips and poppies bloom.
Susan loves watching the flowers change over time. For example, she likes to put tulips in water and watch them change shape and color. She's always been interested in plants and used to collect wildflowers when she was a child. Now, she has a big garden with many plants from all around the world.
Susan doesn't mind if her garden gets a bit messy. She just wants to make sure it's not damaged. She has a lot of work to do right now, preparing for two art exhibitions, but she knows it's important to spend time in her garden to get inspiration for her paintings. She even has an extra gardener to help her now.

Five famous people tell us about their favorite train journeys. 
Andrea Thompson - Newsreader I love traveling to the south of France. There's a train that goes along the coast and into Italy. It's very beautiful. You can see the sea and the houses of rich people. The train is always full of happy people from different countries. They all love the journey.
Raj Patel - Explorer I have taken many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was a child, I never got to go on a family train trip. I was too young and sent to live with an aunt. When I moved to England, I saw my first big train station in London. It was amazing!
Betty Cooper - Novelist I'm very grateful for one special train. It took me and my husband on our honeymoon to France and then to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress. I loved it! The journey was very relaxing. We traveled through France and then by boat up the Nile River.
Martin Brown - Journalist We were writing a series of articles about a trip around the world. We had to cross a desert in Africa, so we took the Desert Express. The train was late, and we didn't know when it would come. When it arrived, many people got on, even some who sat on the roof! At night, the train went through very beautiful landscapes. It was like a dream.
Arisu Mezuki - Actress I didn't grow up with trains like many people do. I saw very few trains in Singapore and Cyprus. But when I was a teenager, I made a film about a train in Yorkshire, England. I loved the old train and the people who took care of it. When I went back to the train station, everything was still the same, even the old gas lights."

Want to get published? Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many readers write to us asking, ""Where can I send my story?"" The first thing they need to know is that they should research their markets and learn about publishers. Writing is a business, and you need to know what kind of writing is wanted. One way to do this is to read lots of books and magazines. Go to your local library and bookstore to see what's popular. This will help you know what kind of writing publishers are looking for.
When you start writing, it's a good idea to find out which magazines publish the kind of writing you want to do. For example, if you want to write love stories, find out which magazines publish them. Read recent copies and see what kind of stories they like. Understand who their readers are and what they want to read.
Some writers send me their work and ask if it's any good. I always try to be honest, but I also try to be kind. The problem is that many new writers send their work out too soon. It's not usually ready for publication. When you finally send your work, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. This will help you get better and more confident. Don't show your work to anyone else until you're sure it's ready. Every successful writer has had many rejections before they succeeded. To get better, take a writing course or join a writers' group. Think of yourself as a writer and write every day if you can.

I was waiting for a train at the Baltimore railway station on a very bad day. There were more people than I expected. The station didn't feel clean and calm like it usually does. There were elderly couples with suitcases, and college students with big backpacks. A well-dressed man was talking to strangers. He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia. Then he came to a girl with blonde hair who was standing near me. I thought I might talk to her. The man asked her if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to New York. He moved on to the next person.
Now he was talking to an old lady. I straightened up and walked a little closer. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me. He looked at me and then went to talk to another couple. He looked very worried.
He asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes, and he asked her for a favor. I stopped walking and looked down. The woman looked a bit suspicious. The man said it wasn't a big favor, and he was trying to help his daughter. His daughter was going to fly to Philadelphia and had forgotten her passport. He had told her to stay at the station and he would get someone to bring her passport.
The woman asked him why he didn't go himself, but he said he couldn't leave his wife alone because she is in a wheelchair. I thought this was a strange excuse. I looked at the two of them. The man had a big envelope with something inside. It was padded and stapled shut. I thought, ""Be careful, lady!""

My son Gary is a famous TV chef. I, John Moore, own a restaurant and have a good relationship with Gary. I believe everyone gets a chance in life. When I saw the restaurant, it was in a bad state, but I saw an opportunity. I thought about my childhood when my mother worked in a factory and I was left alone. I wanted to make sure our family had time together. My wife helped with the business and took care of the children. We lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped our children, Gary and Joe, become confident. Gary was a lively child and started helping out in the kitchen when he was young. He worked hard and was very good at it. By the time he was 15, he was as good as the other chefs. He went to catering college and did very well. Now, he has his own TV cookery show. I'm very proud of him.

Here is a simplified version of the passage at the A2 level:
Finding a flat in Dublin was like finding a treasure. Jo had just moved to Dublin and didn't know anyone. She had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown. She didn't ask herself why she was moving to Dublin. Everyone at school thought she would go to Dublin. It was a big city, and Jo had never been there before.
Jo's family thought she should stay in the hostel. Her mother thought it was a safe place, and her father worried it would be cold. Jo's sisters thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for so long. But Jo wanted to find a flat.
Jo saw an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said she could have her own room, TV, and share the kitchen and bathroom. It was near her work at the post office. She hoped it was true. There weren't many people waiting for this flat because it said ""Third Girl Wanted"". Jo wondered if it was too expensive, but the house looked normal. A girl named Nessa was coming down the stairs. She said the flat was not great, but Jo didn't care. Nessa and her friend Pauline were nice. They offered Jo a cup of tea and a mug with ""Other"" written on it."

People love dolphins. They are very intelligent and can understand human emotions. We often see them in films and TV shows. But, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species.
Dolphins are special animals that live in the sea. There are many kinds of dolphins, but some are in danger. The North Sea harbour porpoise population has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected, but they are not.
There are many dolphins in the waters of northern Europe. Some live far out in the sea, while others are found near European coasts. The bottlenose dolphin and the harbour porpoise used to be common near European coasts, but now they are rare. They are stressed and injured, and we don't know why.
Dolphins are in danger because of overfishing, which is reducing the world's fish stocks. This makes it hard for dolphins to find food. They also get caught in fishermen's nets, which can be invisible to them. In recent years, many dead dolphins have been found on beaches, with marks and cuts on their bodies showing that they were caught in nets.
Dolphins can also get sick from pollution in the sea. They can store waste and poisons in their bodies, which can harm them and their babies. For example, pesticides can build up in a dolphin's body and be passed on to its baby through its milk. In one case, a baby dolphin was poisoned and killed by its mother's milk.
The final threat to dolphins is noise pollution. Dolphins live in groups and communicate with each other through sound. But human noise, such as from ships and oil wells, can disturb them in ways we don't yet understand."

EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOU
Exercise is important for your body, mind, and spirit. It helps you feel good and stay healthy. There are many reasons why you should exercise. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you look better. It also helps you sleep better and feel less stressed.
Exercise can help you with problems like depression and tiredness. It can even help with some medical conditions. There are many types of exercise you can do, like aerobics, jogging, and weightlifting.
Remember to start slowly and carefully when you begin exercising. It's also a good idea to talk to a doctor before you start. Good posture is important too. If you slouch, try to imagine a helium balloon pulling your head up towards the sky. This will help you stand up straight and breathe more easily.
Stretching is important to improve your flexibility and prevent injuries. You should stretch four or five times a week. The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, a good workout, and a cool-down.

Suzie Ellis interviewed Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra has a busy schedule before the World Championships. She teaches at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training venue. 'I'm too focused on my movements and feet to notice anything else,' she said.
Kendra's life is all about getting ready for the World Championships. She has a strict schedule to get fit. This is her fourth time playing in the World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet. 27 countries will be taking part.
We will have home support, which is special. It's important for netball in England to be well-known. There will be more pressure than usual because we will have a home crowd. They will expect us to play well.
Our first game is against Barbados. We usually win against them, but they will be tough to play. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But Kendra says it will be tough. We have to play well every day, and there's no rest between games. We can still win if we lose the first game, but the Championships are different. We only get one chance, and we have to be ready.
Netball has become harder and faster over the years. Players are more aggressive on the court. But after the game, we are all friendly. Netball is also using new ways to test our fitness. As captain, I have to be strong and lead by example.
I plan to stop playing after this competition. But I will probably coach young players in the future. When I lead my team out at the opening ceremony, I will probably have a tear in my eye. My supporters will be behind me every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves to spend time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes down to the ocean floor in a special vehicle that's like a small car. It takes her three hours to get down, and she stays there for 10 hours collecting samples of rock and water. Then she goes back up to the surface.
The vehicle is very small, so Rachel has to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. If something goes wrong, she can press a special button and a small escape boat will come out and take her to the surface. Rachel has made six dives so far. Last year, she went with a Russian team to a place with lots of underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes are like chimneys that blow out black smoke.
When Rachel isn't at sea, she works in her office at the university. She teaches and does research on underwater volcanoes, which are also called ""black smokers"". She loves her job and feels lucky to be able to explore the deep ocean. Rachel has been studying underwater volcanoes for three years and it's an amazing feeling to see them in person."

**First Impressions Matter**
When we meet someone for the first time, we often form an opinion about them quickly. This is because we notice how they dress, how they talk, and how they move their body. Mary Pearce, a teacher, learned this the hard way. She had a small hole in her jacket when she went for a job interview, but she didn't change because she was worried about being late. Unfortunately, the interviewer thought she wasn't taking the job seriously.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, agrees that how we look can affect how we come across. He says that if we don't take care of ourselves, we might not care about our work either. Many people forget to dress professionally for interviews, like Janet Goodwood, who didn't get an interview for a promotion because of her clothes.
Our body language and facial expressions also matter. A psychologist found that 55% of how we feel comes from our facial expressions, not what we say. We should make sure our words and body language match. It's also important not to show too much excitement or eagerness for a job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, learned this the hard way when she got a job offer and reacted too enthusiastically.
Finally, knowing what to say and how to say it can make a difference. David Artesio, a job agency manager, suggests researching the company before an interview and asking questions about areas that interest you. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, advises using short, clear sentences and being prepared with questions.

A Darius (runner) I like sports. When I was young, I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on running instead. My best moment was when I got to run for my country and won a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much attention from the media. I have to train a lot, both at home and away. I go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun, but I have to say no to going out with friends the night before training. Being dedicated is important in my sport. My goal is to go to the next Olympics.
B Gabriel (surfer) Surfing is a small community, so I see the same people everywhere I compete. Professional surfers are serious and usually go out early in the morning to find the best waves. I have to give up late nights and lie-ins, but it's worth it because it helped me win the National Championships. After a big win, I like to celebrate with my friends. I also got a TV show because of my win, so I'm a bit famous now.
C Dieter (yacht racer) It's fun racing with my friends on a boat. We like to celebrate our wins together. Sometimes reporters ask us about where we go out and what we do, but we don't try to get attention. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to go back home and do normal things. I'm known in the sailing world, but not many people recognize me on the street. I like getting letters from fans and try to answer every one.
D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to play in front of a crowd. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy, but I still like being recognized by fans when I'm out and about. However, it can be a problem. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got attention from female fans. As a tennis player, I have to travel a lot, which is why we broke up. You have to make sacrifices in sports. I'm focusing on my game now and will catch up on other things when I retire."

Shopping with children can be very difficult for some mothers. They want everything they see, like new toys, sweets, and games. But mothers often can't afford all these things and feel guilty when they say no. They worry that if they say yes, they will be giving their children too much junk food. On the other hand, if they say no, they feel bad and get upset. Some mothers try to avoid taking their children shopping, but they worry that their children won't learn to make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes when they are shopping with their parents. Many companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. This can make it hard for parents to explain to their children why they can't have something. Children often don't understand why their parents say no, and parents feel like they are competing with the advertising companies.
Some parents feel stressed when they have to decide what to buy and what not to buy. They want to teach their children to make good choices, but it's hard to say no all the time. One mother says she talks to her son about different products and looks at labels with him. This helps him understand that advertisements are not always true. Now, they don't argue as much when they are shopping.
Some parents admit that they are not always consistent in what they allow their children to buy. They might say no to their child's request for sweets, but then buy chocolate for themselves. It's hard to be fair and consistent all the time. Supermarkets could make it easier for parents by moving sweets to a different part of the store or providing a play area for children. This might make parents more likely to shop there.

'ICE SKATING Ice skating has been around for a very long time. People used animal bones to make skates a long time ago. In Scandinavia, skating was important for the rich people. In the early 20th century, skating was fashionable, but a young girl named Sonja Henie changed the way people skated at the 1924 Winter Olympics. Now, skating combines art and sports. It's both beautiful and challenging.
To start, you need to be balanced and in control. You need to bend your knees and lean slightly forward. It's important to relax while skating. To start, stand with your heels almost touching and your feet pointing outwards. Move one foot forward and then the other. It's easy, right? As you get better, you can try longer movements.
It's important to know how to fall safely. Even good skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, relax as much as possible. When you get up, use your hands to get into a kneeling position and then stand up.
Once you're comfortable moving on the ice, you can try different styles, like figure skating, free skating, and speed skating. The best way to start is to learn figure skating and then free skating. Many ice rinks offer lessons, so you can learn quickly.
Look at good skaters and you'll see how relaxed they are. To be like them, you should exercise regularly. You should warm up before skating and cool down afterwards. Skating is good for your balance, coordination, and overall health. It's also good for your heart and lungs. You can combine skating with swimming or jogging for a great workout.'"

Many years ago, people didn't eat the same food as we do now. They ate different foods like fruits, berries, and animals. This made them strong and healthy. But then, people started farming and eating the same foods every day. This made them weak and unhealthy.
Now, some countries are eating better and getting taller again. The average height in the US, Holland, and Japan is getting higher. But, there are some problems. Beds and seats on planes and trains are still the same size, and clothes are getting harder to make. We don't know how tall we can get, but some scientists think we might reach 193 cm this century.
However, some scientists think that as a species, we are actually getting smaller. A long time ago, people were bigger and round because it helped them stay warm. Now, as the climate gets warmer, we might get smaller again. This means that even if we are eating well, we might not get taller forever.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being recorded? I went to a TV studio to find out. Many people think that studio audiences are weird, but they're not. They come from all walks of life. TV producers try to get different types of people for different shows.
Some people might think, ""Why would anyone want to sit in a studio for hours to watch TV when they can watch it at home?"" But there are reasons why people want to be in the studio. Some people want to be on TV for a few seconds. Others are curious to see how TV shows are made. And some just got a ticket from a friend.
When you're in a studio audience, you sit with strangers and follow signs that tell you when to clap or laugh. But it's not always like that. Sometimes the show is good enough that you don't need signs. I went to a studio and it was exciting, but I missed seeing the actors up close. Watching TV at home is different from being in a studio, but for many people, it's just a fun night out.

I like places with people and things that humans have built. When I travel, I like to visit old villages with temples, not empty deserts. When I was a child, I went to school in England and loved exploring the countryside. I would cycle to a village called Lastingham and visit the hills and valleys. I still go back there today.
I like a special train ride in England. The train goes from Hythe to Dungeness and passes through people's backyards. I like seeing people doing everyday things like making tea or doing laundry. It's nice to see what other people are doing.
I also like a place called the Hartland Peninsula. It's a beautiful and quiet coast with few people. The beaches are rocky and hard to reach, but the sea is very big and powerful. You can walk along the coast and then go inland to see old oak trees and wildflowers.
My friend Annette likes a place called the Trough of Bowland. It's a big, open area with no many people. She likes to hike there and feel the space.
My friend James bought a house in a place called Glenthorne. It's a special house that he loves. He grew up in a different country, but he went to school in England and loved cycling around the countryside. He found Glenthorne by chance and it's his favorite place in Britain."

We love animals. One day, my daughter found a snake. She asked if we could keep it. I said yes, but only for one night. We have a special tank for animals that pass through our house. I was late getting home, so I hurried to put dinner on the stove. When I got to my sons' room, I heard screams. My cat, Domino, had caught a mouse. The mouse was waving its feet in the air. Domino was running around the room, trying to get away from the kids. I tried to help, but I tripped and fell. When I looked up, I saw the snake was loose. It was sliding out of its tank and all over the floor. I was scared, so I crouched down like a rabbit. The snake was hissing and striking at everything. The cat, mouse, and kids were all running around, screaming. I finally managed to catch the cat and get the mouse out of its mouth. The snake was too strong, so I had to be careful. I sat down on the floor and slowly moved my hands under the snake's body. When I stood up, I pointed to a tree and let the snake go. It slid up my shoulder and wrapped itself around me like a blanket. We stood there in the dark, my kids, me, and the snake. My oldest son said, ""You're warm and comfortable, and the shed isn't."" I told the kids to gently push the snake towards the wall. It slowly moved up the wall and disappeared over the roof. My three-year-old son said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!"""

""Write to me! In today's world of phones and computers, writing letters is becoming less popular. But I think it's special to receive a letter. There's the excitement of getting it, seeing who it's from, and reading the message. I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember. When I was little, I would write notes to my mom. My mom always wanted me to write thank-you letters for presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I moved to London to study to be a doctor, I would write to my mom once a week. Sometimes my dad would write too, and it was always fun to read his letters. The letters from home usually told us about what was happening with my parents and their friends. We would also talk on the phone, but I remember the letters more.
I also wrote letters to my boyfriends when I was younger. I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away from home, and letters were the only way we could stay in touch. Writing letters actually helped our relationships. I found it easier to express myself in writing than talking.
I love getting letters with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to get a year's worth of news! And it's extra special if the letter comes from far away, with fun stamps.
I have penfriends in different countries, like Sri Lanka and Australia. I also have a penfriend in France, whom I met in a restaurant. If I hadn't asked for her address, we might not be writing to each other now. It's important to keep writing letters. I'm happy to see my children writing letters too. Like my mom, I want them to write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little notes, just like I did to my mom. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I think it's important to keep writing letters, and not let it become a lost art.""

Many ancient pictures on a mountain in France are being damaged. These pictures are very old, over 4,000 years old. They were drawn on the rocks by people who lived a long time ago. The pictures show things like cows, fields, and gods and goddesses.
But now, many tourists are visiting the mountain and damaging the pictures. They are not careful and are touching the drawings, which is wearing them away. Some people even take pieces of the rock as souvenirs. Others try to make the pictures clearer by rubbing them, but this is also damaging them.
Scientists and researchers are worried that if the damage continues, the pictures will be gone in 50 years. They want to find a way to protect the site. Some people think that the best way is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, so only guided tours can visit. Others think that this would be too strict and that people should be able to visit the site, but with guides.
The problem is that there is no money to hire enough guards to protect the site. Some people think that charging a fee to visit the site could help pay for the guards. Others think that the government should provide the money to protect the site because it is a historic site.
The scientists are worried that if they don't do something, the pictures will be lost forever. They want to find a way to save them for future generations."

Shopping with kids can be very difficult for some mothers. They always want everything they see. If it's not a new breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. The mother feels guilty if she says yes, but if she says no, she feels bad too. She worries about not letting her kids make their own choices. Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes when they're shopping. Companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. This can make it hard for parents to say no to their kids' requests. 
Some parents are concerned about what their kids eat and have ideas about what is healthy, but these ideas might not be correct. A good thing is that parents and kids talk about food and products. This way, kids get a more balanced view. However, parents feel like they are competing with the advertising industry and it's hard to say no to their kids. 
Some parents find it stressful to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says she talks to her kids about products and labels, and they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy anymore. Parents also admit they are not consistent in their answers to their kids' requests. They might say no to their kids for one thing, but yes to something else. Supermarkets could make it easier for parents by moving sweets away from the checkout area or providing play areas for kids. This could make parents more likely to shop there.

""Climbing is no longer just for the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is hanging upside down from his fingers. This is a big competition, and the crowd is watching closely.
Not long ago, climbers only had mountains to climb. But in the winter, the weather was too cold, so they had to stop climbing. They used to climb on snow and ice in Scotland instead. As the sport grew, climbers needed to stay fit. They started using walls to train, even on flat buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and not get bored.
Many sports centers built walls just for climbing. These walls were made with special edges to hold onto. One teacher, Don Robinson, built a climbing wall in his school in the 1960s. He had an idea to put real rock in concrete, which could be used in a wall. Many walls like this were built in sports halls across the country.
However, these walls had some problems. They could only be built straight up and down, not like the cliffs outside with overhangs and steep parts. And once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed, so climbers got bored. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a special material that could be molded into shapes like the ones on cliffs. This could be attached to any wall and then taken off when climbers wanted to try something new. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. This way, they could build walls that were free-standing and had many different holds to climb."""

Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone, they might say it's a risky job. And they're right! There are many people who want to be actors, but not many jobs available. Some friends might even tell you you're crazy for choosing this career. But it's a personal choice, and you have to take responsibility for yourself and your dreams.
Becoming an actor isn't easy. There's no special test or guarantee of success. It's a mix of luck and talent. But there's always a chance to find new faces and new talent. Acting can be exciting, glamorous, and sometimes very rewarding.
So, what makes someone a good actor? It's a natural skill combined with imagination. And imagination is hard to measure. It's also about being brave and believing in yourself.
Why do people want to act? It's often hard to explain. For actors, the most important thing is the moment when they connect with the audience. This connection is what drives them to act. When asked how they succeed, actors usually shrug and say they don't know. They know some things about themselves and their skills, but they never take anything for granted. They know their success can end at any moment.
Actors don't like to talk about their chances of getting a job. They find ways to protect themselves from stress and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. From the start, actors know there's a chance they might not get the part they want. They have to be willing to take risks and show they care about their work.

Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain. He is 228 cm tall. When he was 14, he wanted to join the navy. His teacher asked him what he wanted to be, and Chris said he wanted to be the flagpole on a ship. Chris is very tall because, on average, people in Europe are getting taller. Every year, more people are born who are very tall.
A long time ago, people didn't eat the same foods we eat today. They ate many different foods from nature. This made them strong and healthy. Then, people started farming. This changed what we eat. Now, most people eat just three foods: wheat, rice, and maize. This has made us unhealthy and not as strong as we used to be.
In the past, when people ate many different foods, they were healthy and strong. But when they started farming, they became unhealthy. Now, some countries are going back to eating more like our ancestors did. This is making people taller again. In the US, Japan, and Holland, people are getting taller.
But, there are some problems. Beds are still the same size they were 150 years ago. And, clothes don't fit as well as they used to. Scientists don't know how tall people will get. Some think we might get as tall as 193 cm. But, others think we might even get smaller. This is because the Earth is getting warmer, and people might get smaller to stay warm.

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, love playing a game from their childhood. They are in their 40s and live in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The game is called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Canada. The family played it every weekend and holiday. They moved to New Mexico, but they still played pichenotte. When visitors came, they were surprised because the game was not well-known in the USA.
One day, Dave made a new pichenotte board. People liked it, and soon they were making more. They took one to a sports bar in Santa Fe and people wanted to play. The brothers discovered that the game came from India and was played in Canada and Britain before coming to the USA.
Pichenotte is a game of skill. Players use small pieces (pucks) to flick across a board. The goal is to get the pucks into holes or rings. The game is easy to learn and takes only two minutes to play. The brothers started selling the boards at markets and craft fairs. People loved the game, and soon they were making more boards. They even created a championship and a trophy.
The brothers now make the boards full-time. They work in their garage and have made over 450 boards so far. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany and weighs 12kg. They sell the boards on their website for $595 each. The brothers are happy to play the game they love and hope it will make them rich one day."

**Welcome to the Model Village**
When you first come to the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago this was a piece of empty land covered in brambles. One man, with the help of his wife, worked hard to turn this land into the beautiful village you see today. They moved a lot of soil and clay to create the hills and valleys. It was a big job that needed a lot of hard work.
They planted hundreds of trees and shrubs, but they had to choose the right ones for this place near the sea. The plants had to be able to handle the salty air and strong winds. Some plants came from local gardens, while others came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.
The man who created the village, Colin Sims, made over 100 models by himself over nine years. He used different materials like stone, concrete, and plastic to make them strong. He learned how to make them by asking experts for help, but soon became an expert himself.
You will notice that all the models are the same size and have lots of details. This took a lot of patience and special techniques. The village is very popular and is known for its high quality and good maintenance. The techniques used here have been used in other model villages and even in schools.
The buildings in the village are based on traditional British styles and are not copies of real places. You will see a big stone house, a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models. You can take pictures from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are welcome on a short leash.
We would like you to tell us what you think of the village and which models you like the most. We are always making new models and need your feedback to make the village even better. We hope you have a great time and will come back soon."

""Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules of journalism. Sometimes, famous people agree to have their pictures taken by the paparazzi. But usually, these pictures are taken without permission and cause harm to people who are in the public eye. These pictures are not in the public interest. They do not help us know about important news or keep us safe. 
Some famous people have been in the news recently because of private pictures being taken. One actress was photographed on her hotel balcony. She should have been left alone because it's a private place. But she didn't complain. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) is supposed to help with problems like this. But they didn't take action. 
It's not fair that the PCC doesn't do more to stop these kinds of pictures. They should take the initiative and stop newspapers from publishing them. But it's not easy. The PCC would have to decide when to investigate and how to do it. They would also have to deal with famous people who might not want to complain. Some people might be worried that if they complain, the newspaper will find something else to write about them. 
One famous comedian was photographed on his honeymoon and again on a family holiday. He didn't complain because he was worried that the newspaper would use the pictures to make a new story. People are afraid to challenge the newspapers because they think they will be targeted again. It's hard to find a solution to this problem."""

This article is for people who have been in their first job for a while, learned some skills, and know what they want to do. What kind of job should you look for? Think about your long-term goals. Do you want to specialize in a certain field, take on more responsibility, or move to a different area? Whatever you choose, make sure you choose a job that is right for you. You should stay in this job for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career and want to grow and learn.
It's also a good time to travel if you want to. You can work temporarily when you get back and then find a new job. Employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and won't be likely to leave again.

What is money? Money is like a measure, like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can trade it for something else. A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that doesn't cost much to make.
A long time ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Instead, people traded things they had for things they needed. For example, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for honey from Mr. Hive. This was a deal between two people who had something the other wanted.
Later, most groups of people created their own money, so it was easier to trade. Different types of money started to work together, and that's why we use national money today."

'Hypatia was a famous scientist who lived a long time ago in Egypt. She was the only woman scientist in the history books for a long time. Her father was a important person at a big school in Alexandria, and he made sure she got a good education. This was special because most women didn't have the chance to learn back then. Hypatia went to school in Athens and Rome, and then she came back to Alexandria to teach mathematics. She became very good at her job and people knew her for her new ideas. Unfortunately, we don't have any of her books, but we know she wrote important math books. Hypatia also liked inventing new tools to help her with her work. But, some people didn't like science and were afraid of it. One day, Hypatia was attacked and killed in the street.'"

'Grass is very good at growing. There are many kinds of grass - over 9,000! You can find them everywhere on Earth. Grass can even grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctica. Grass is important for many animals. They eat it, live in it, and depend on it. Grass is strong and can grow back quickly if it gets cut or damaged. It grows from the roots, not from the top of the plant. This means that many animals can live together in the same place. When they eat all the grass, new grass will grow soon. This is why animals can always find food in the same place.'"

Kal Kaur Rai is a young and talented fashion designer. She recently won an award for being the best young achiever of the year. Kal has always loved drawing and designing clothes. When she was a child, she would draw patterns and clothes. But she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream to become a fashion designer. She thought they wanted her to work in a big business, so she went to university to study management.
After university, Kal moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to go to fashion events, but she couldn't afford to wear the nice clothes she liked. So, she started making her own clothes. Her friends liked them and asked her to make more. A small shop in London liked her designs and wanted to sell them. The clothes were very popular and didn't come back. This made Kal decide to leave her job and start her own fashion label. Her parents were happy with her decision and said they would support her.
Now, Kal's clothes are sold in over 70 stores and her business makes a lot of money. Her clothes are even in fashion magazines, and she designs clothes for famous singers. She is very lucky and knows that she worked hard to get where she is. Kal says, ""What I do is my hobby, and I get paid for it! But I worked hard for this."""

'The Ghan Train is a famous train in Australia. It goes from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south. The train travels across the country, from the warm north to the cold south. It's not a fast train, but it's a special one. The Ghan is known for being late, but it's still a popular train. Many people take it to see the sights along the way.
The train was built a long time ago to carry goods from Europe to Australia. Now, it takes passengers on a journey across the country. The train stops a few times along the way, and some people get off to go on a boat trip or explore the area. I went to Alice Springs and saw Uluru (Ayers Rock). We walked around the rock and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, some people get off the train and stay for a few days before continuing their journey. The train doesn't go through very interesting places after Alice Springs, but it's still a great journey. At the end, you can see the ocean and the hills. I had a great time on the Ghan Train and saw many amazing things in Australia.'"

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis, a big mountain in Scotland. It's very cold there because it's in the north. Keith Hewitt, a climber, went to Ben Nevis for the first time in February. He went up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long way up - 600 metres. They planned to stay in a special place called the 'Carries' for three days. The Carries are like big bowls cut into the mountain. They brought tents, sleeping bags, and special spikes for their boots because the snow is very hard and slippery.
Even though some of the group were very experienced, they took many safety things with them, like lights, hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, but everyone felt a bit nervous. Ben Nevis is a big challenge in winter. The track went up and my legs felt tired. I had to rest often because I was the weakest in the group. The others waited for me to catch up, but then they went on again. I promised myself to train better before the next climb.
After 200 metres, we reached the beginning of Tower Ridge. It's very narrow and the mountain drops down very far on both sides. We had to be careful and concentrate on every step. After seven hours, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and even the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. But it was misty when we were there. Going down the mountain can be just as hard as going up. You need to know how to read a map correctly or you might get lost. I was glad we took turns doing that job. It wasn't until I was safe in my tent that I really enjoyed the experience."

Anna's new school
We're very excited because we've moved into our new school building! It's a great place, made of wood, just like our old school. But it's also very special because it's designed to be good for the environment. The builders took a long time to build it, so we got to see it being made. It was fun to watch, but sometimes the noise was very loud. The builders had to stop work when it rained a lot.
Now we have five big classrooms. We share one room with the town people when they need to meet. There's also a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. We're looking forward to using them when our new sports field is ready.
When you come into the school, you'll notice that it's warm inside, even without heaters. This is because we, the children, the teachers, and the computers all make heat. The building is designed to keep the heat inside. You can even hear us singing in the classrooms and it sounds like a concert hall!
You'll also see a tree on the roof. The builders put it there because it's a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for our lights and computers comes from a big wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went to see it yesterday and it's very big and fast. We took pictures and will put them on our website.
We're still using the school, but there are some things that need to be added, like a new hall for our play. It will be ready next year. We're very happy with our new school and our teachers think we'll learn even better now that we're here."

On Saturday morning, we met the other people in our group. Some friends, Cameron, Kevin, and Simon, came with their friends. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would be outside all weekend, but we didn't know what we would do. Some of us went caving in the morning, and the others went rock-climbing. Matt and I went caving first. Getting out was harder than going in, but we did it!

THE ICEHOTEL
For a long time, people went to the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in the winter, the few people who lived there had the snow and ice all to themselves. One day, some people thought, ""Why not use the cold and dark winter to build something special?"" In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to build an igloo in a small town called Jukkasjarvi. The igloo was called Arctic Hall and many people came to visit.
One night, some brave visitors had the idea to sleep in the igloo. They were very happy with their experience and that's how the idea of an ice hotel was born. Now, every year, people from all over the world come to build the hotel. They make it bit by bit, and each part opens to visitors as it's finished. The hotel is built outside, using natural materials like snow and ice. When it's finished, it's ready for guests to stay in.
The hotel is very cold, but not too cold. It's always between -5°C and -8°C inside. You need to wear warm clothes, like a hat and gloves, and bring extra socks and a scarf. You can buy these things on the hotel's website when you book your stay. The hotel is in a small village called Jukkasjarvi, near the Arctic Circle. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to get there.

A new shop called Homestyle sells furniture. It opened at midnight on Thursday, but it had to close soon after because too many people came. There were special deals, like a sofa for PS45 and a bed for PS30, but only for a short time. The shop usually opens from 9 am to 9 pm, but it stayed open all night on its first day. However, it had to close after just half an hour because there were too many people. A police officer came to help, but the people outside got angry because they thought everything would sell out before they could get in. They didn't want to wait in line quietly. Another problem was that there were many cars trying to park, and some people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the rest of the way to the shop. This blocked the road.
One customer, Jenny, was lucky enough to get into the shop. She waited for three hours, but didn't have time to buy what she wanted. The staff were calm and explained the situation. They had to close the shop because it wasn't safe. Jenny said she will come back when the shop reopens, but she doesn't want to wait in line again."

Tanya Streeter is a world champion free-diver. She holds four records in this sport. Free-diving is when people dive deep into the ocean without breathing equipment. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep into the ocean and coming back up without help. She was the first person to do this. Before, she had gone deeper, but she used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three minutes. This made her the only woman to break a world record set by a man.
Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya says safety is the most important thing. She also thinks training is very important. Tanya trains hard every day. Two-thirds of her training is on land, and the rest is in the pool or in the ocean. She also uses a special bike to make her heart strong.
Tanya usually travels to different places to train. She does 14 dives over four weeks, with a rest day in between. She needs to stay fit and healthy so she can do her best. When she's not training, Tanya does public appearances to promote sports products. She also helps protect the environment by doing research and making films.
Tanya grew up on a Caribbean island where she loved swimming and exploring the ocean. She says her life is like living her childhood dreams. Because she's famous, people listen to her when she talks about protecting the environment. Tanya plans to keep breaking her own records and will continue free-diving for many years to come."

Norwich is a city in East Anglia, a part of Britain. It has been a place to live for over 2,000 years. A long time ago, it was a small village near a river. By the time the Normans came to England in 1066, Norwich had grown into a big town. There are two big churches and a mosque in Norwich. One of the churches was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th birthday. Norwich got a special permission to be called a city and make its own decisions in 1194.
Norwich is a small city compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000 people. But a long time ago, it was the second biggest city in England. Over the years, it grew and became richer. Norwich was famous for having many churches and pubs. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but Norwich has a university and is a good place for business. The city has many things to do, like going to the cinema, eating at nice restaurants, and visiting museums.
Norwich has a football team called the Canaries, but nobody knows why they chose that name. The city has a new shopping centre called the Castle Mall, and people can walk through a park in the middle of the city. The old market is still there, and it's popular with locals and visitors.

The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every year, the city of Albuquerque in the United States has a big balloon festival. It's a nine-day event. The first festival was in 1972. It started with just a few balloons, but now it's much bigger. This year, balloons from many countries will come to the festival.
What to see and do At night, the pilots make their balloons light up together. This is called a 'balloon glow'. It's a great time to take pictures. But you have to come early or late to see it. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots. The balloons come in different sizes and shapes, like animals or cartoon characters. Kids will love it!
You can also go on a balloon ride over the desert or take a cable car to the top of the nearby mountains. There are many other things to do, like balloon races and fireworks.
The Albuquerque Box This is a special wind pattern that helps the balloons fly. The mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and make it easier for pilots to control their direction.
Practical tips Buy your tickets online to avoid waiting in line. Wear thin clothes, as it can be cold at night and early morning. Bring sunglasses, suncream, a flashlight, and your camera. If you're not digital, bring high-speed film for night-time pictures.

Margaret Porter, a violin teacher, says that the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is because children learn about the world at this age. Margaret teaches children at her home in London. She usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but sometimes she makes exceptions for very keen five-year-olds.
Margaret's students have group lessons. There are about 12 children in each group, and they meet once every two weeks. Each child also has a one-on-one lesson with Margaret once a week. Parents must come to the lessons too. It's important for parents to help their children learn.
At first, children learn to play the violin by listening. They don't learn to read music until they've been playing for a few years. There's a big difference between playing and reading music. Margaret's method is not meant to make children into great violinists. If a child is very good, she suggests they go to a different teacher who uses a more traditional way of teaching."

'Moonshine is a band. They just released their third CD. It's called ""Here Again"". This is the next one after ""The Waves"". There are some new members in the band. Tom Wilcott is now playing the bass guitar, and Tom Simpson is the new drummer. They used to have a different drummer, Simon McVee, but he left the band last year.
The first two songs on the CD are very upbeat and fun to dance to. They are different from the slow songs the band usually makes. The rest of the CD is more like their usual style. These two new songs might surprise some fans, but they are very good and could be big hits.
The singer, Rob Letchford, does a great job singing these songs. He can sing really well and reaches the high notes perfectly. Unfortunately, he had some trouble with his throat, so the band had to cancel their next tour. But don't worry, they will reschedule the concerts when Rob feels better.
Moonshine can make many kinds of music, from slow songs to fast and fun ones. This CD has a little bit of everything. I think they saved their best songs for the beginning and the end, and the middle ones are not as good. But overall, ""Here Again"" is a great CD and will probably be very popular.'"

'San Francisco is a city on the west coast of the United States. A long time ago, a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola was the first European to see the area. He arrived in 1769. San Francisco Bay is a beautiful and safe place for boats to dock. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to look for gold. But it wasn't the people who found gold who became rich. The richest people made their money by working in banks and law offices. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, people visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some people also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison.'

'SAMUEL PEPYS Samuel Pepys wrote a famous diary. It tells us about everyday life in England from 1660 to 1669. He writes about big news, like sickness, a foreign navy coming up the River Thames, and a big fire in London. He also writes about himself, like when he falls asleep in church or looks at pretty girls. He talks about his home life, like when he and his wife argue and then make up, and when she gets sick. He likes books, music, plays, card games, and parties with good food. Pepys was a busy person who did many important jobs, like being in Parliament and helping the Royal Society. He also helped the British Navy.'
I changed the following to make it more accessible to an A2 learner:
* Simplified vocabulary: I used simpler words like ""everyday life"" instead of ""daily life in England"", ""sickness"" instead of ""disease"", ""foreign navy"" instead of ""enemy navy"", etc.
* Shortened sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to follow.
* Removed complex expressions: I removed phrases like ""important news stories of the time"" and replaced them with simpler language.
* Focused on main ideas: I emphasized the main points of the text, such as Pepys' daily life, his jobs, and his interests, to make it easier for an A2 learner to understand."

'A Long Time Ago, Shoes Were Not Important
A long time ago, people didn't care about shoes being comfortable or looking good. They wore animal skins on their feet to keep warm. We still use leather today, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton. It wasn't until 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, people wore the same shoe on both feet. All shoes were made by hand, but now most are made in big factories using machines. The invention of sewing machines helped make shoes cheaper and more available for everyone.'

""I hurt my back and had to stop running. I wanted to share my love for running with other women and show them how much fun it can be. I started a running group for women in my area because I was upset about how some race organizers treat women. They complain that there aren't enough women running, but they don't provide separate changing rooms for them. I put up posters and 40 women joined. They were all interested in losing weight, but they didn't know much about running. They thought it would be hard and painful. But now they enjoy running and chatting with each other in nice places like by a river. They started with just one minute of running and now they can run for 30 minutes. They've also learned about healthy eating and exercise from other runners. I'm happy to see how much they've improved - almost as happy as they are!"""

A LONG TIME AGO, PEOPLE CAME TO ALASKA TO FIND GOLD. THEY BUILT NEW TOWNS, INCLUDING ONE CALLED IDITAROD. IN THE WINTER, IT WAS HARD TO GET TO THESE TOWNS BECAUSE THE RIVERS AND OCEAN FROZE. SO, PEOPLE BUILT A SPECIAL TRACK FOR DOGS TO PULL SLEDS. THESE DOGS TOOK MAIL, FOOD, AND CLOTHES TO THE GOLD MINERS. THE TRACK WAS CALLED THE IDITAROD TRAIL. IT TOOK THE DOGS ABOUT THREE WEEKS TO GET FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER.
IN THE 1920S, PLANES BECAME MORE POPULAR, AND PEOPLE DIDN'T NEED TO USE DOGS AS MUCH. BUT IN 1925, A BAD DISEASE CALLED DIPHTHERIA CAME TO THE CITY OF NOME. THE ONLY WAY TO CURE IT WAS WITH A SPECIAL MEDICINE, BUT IT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ALASKA. THE PLANES WERE TOO NEW AND NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO FLY IN THE COLD WEATHER. SO, THEY DECIDED TO USE DOGS AGAIN TO BRING THE MEDICINE. IT TOOK 20 TEAMS OF DOGS JUST SIX DAYS TO COMPLETE THE JOURNEY. ONE DOG, BALTO, WAS VERY BRAVE AND HELPED SAVE THE TEAM. NOW, EVERY YEAR, PEOPLE HOLD A DOG SLED RACE FROM ANCHORAGE TO NOME, FOLLOWING THE SAME ROUTE AS THE FAMOUS JOURNEY IN 1925. IT'S CALLED THE IDITAROD AND IS KNOWN AS 'THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH'."

The Ice Hotel in Sweden is very special. It's in a place called Jukkasjarvi, where it can get very cold - as cold as -40°C in winter! But 6,000 people visit every year. This hotel is different because it's made of ice! You can eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made of ice. You can even get married there! The bar is also made of ice, so don't put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are a bit cold, around -4°C, but you'll be given special sleeping bags to keep you warm. If you need, you can also borrow special clothes to wear outside. The hotel is rebuilt every year because it melts in the summer. It takes a lot of work to build it - 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow!"

Maria Mutola was a girl who loved playing football with boys in Mozambique. She was very good and her team won a game. But some people didn't think it was fair that a girl was playing with boys. A man named Jose Craveirinha saw Maria playing and thought she was fast. He asked her to run and she didn't know what he meant. He taught her about athletics and bought her special shoes. Maria worked hard and her legs hurt, but Jose believed in her. He talked to her parents and they let him take her to train in the United States. Maria was scared to leave her family, but she went and met new friends who were also athletes. They were different from her because they worried about clothes and makeup, not about having enough food. Maria was happy to be there and learned a lot. Now, Maria still runs and lives in South Africa with her mother.

The Grand Canyon in the United States was made by the River Colorado. Many people visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and look at the view. The view is very nice, and it's even better with the Skywalk. The Skywalk is a special platform that lets you see the beautiful rocks of the canyon. It's 1219 meters from the Skywalk to the bottom of the canyon. You can only stand on it with 120 people at the same time. It opened in 2007 and many people have used it since then. You need to wear special shoes covers so you don't scratch the glass. When you walk on the Skywalk, it feels like you're flying high in the air like a bird.

THE ROCKIES
The Rocky Mountains are a big mountain range in North America. They go from north to south. They are not as big as the Alps, but they are still very beautiful. There are many roads in the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to take the train. You start in Vancouver, a big and nice city in Canada. Vancouver is special because you can ski just 15 minutes from the city centre. 
There used to be many trains going from Vancouver to other parts of the country, but now there are only three a week. But the trip is still fun! You can sleep on the train, and you get to see very beautiful scenery at night.

'Zoos have been around for over 3,000 years. A long time ago, the rulers of China had a big zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals in zoos were taught to do tricks for visitors. But now, we think it's more important to let animals be themselves. Today, many cities have a zoo or a wildlife park. Some people like zoos because they can learn about animals and see them up close. This wouldn't be possible without zoos. However, some people don't like zoos because they think it's wrong to keep animals in cages. They also think that if zoos are not taken care of well, animals might be unhappy and eat the wrong food.'"

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. We had a competition with other schools and we won! Everyone wore different costumes, like our black uniforms or colorful T-shirts. We didn't look like professional bands, but we're used to playing in competitions, so we played well. Some players even made up new songs on stage. It was fun to watch, but even better when my band played!
Not everyone can join our jazz band, but those who want to play come to practice before school and after school. We listen to jazz and learn about it. We also go to special jazz camps during the summer. Grown-ups are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough. I like jazz because it's new and old at the same time. You can make your own music, but you also feel like you're part of a big tradition. My school is lucky to have great teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn't be able to do what we love.

'It can rain in Marrakesh, Morocco between November and March. But it doesn't happen often. When it does, the streets can get flooded. This is because the city's pipes can't handle the water. Many winters have been dry lately, so when it rains, people are happy. Marrakesh has parks and gardens because of special underground channels. These channels bring water from the mountains all year round. This is why Marrakesh is not a desert. If you go further south, you'll reach Skoura. There, people make small squares with water channels to grow food. The Atlas mountains are very pretty in the winter with snow.'

Welcome to Antarctica Sightseeing Flights! Here's what you need to know before booking a flight.
We take tourists on a special plane from Sydney, Australia to see Antarctica and back. The flight is 12 hours long. We usually see ice and icebergs after four hours. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and then head back.
On the way, experts who have lived in Antarctica will talk to us about the environment and history. You can also ask them questions. You'll have a special camera to see what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.
When we're in the air, you'll get to move to different seats to see the sights from different angles. You might even get a window seat! While we're over Antarctica, you're encouraged to get up and walk around to see the amazing views.
What if the weather is bad? We have special plans to make sure we can still see the best views. Can I see penguins and other animals? Unfortunately, we're too high up to see them clearly. But you can take a boat tour to see them up close.
Can I take photos? Yes, you can! All cameras are welcome. We even have fun activities where you can try on Antarctic clothes.

Driving in the Winter
Winter driving can be tricky. You can't always predict what will happen, and accidents can happen quickly. Fog can suddenly appear over a hill, and ice can be hidden under the snow, waiting to make you lose control of your car. Another car might slide across the road in front of you.
To drive safely on icy roads, remember two important rules. First, drive smoothly. Don't make sudden movements, like turning the wheel or hitting the brakes. This can make your car hard to control. Imagine you have a cup of hot coffee next to you - drive carefully so you don't spill it.
Second, pay attention to what might happen. On icy roads, you need to look far ahead and be prepared to stop. Test how long it takes to stop by slowing down gently. Remember, you might be going faster than you think. When the road is wet, snowy, or icy, leave more space between you and the car in front of you. Try to stay in control of your car, and you'll be safe."

Craigie Aitchison was a Scottish painter. He went to London to study law, but he decided to study art instead. He found it hard to learn traditional drawing skills, but he kept painting. When he was in his late 20s, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. He liked the light and colors of the Italian countryside and wanted to put this in his paintings.
Aitchison paints by putting thin layers of color on top of each other, from light to dark. He doesn't know exactly what the final result will be. He says, ""It's a secret because I don't know myself."" He doesn't make drawings before starting a painting, because he might get bored and not finish it. Instead, he changes his paintings many times until they are finished.
Aitchison likes to paint people who don't want to see their pictures while he's painting. If they ask to see the painting, he can't focus. He doesn't follow any specific style or tradition in his painting. He just paints the way he feels like painting. Despite this, his work still inspires young British painters."

Ben said, 'It's better than watching TV or playing video games. It'll keep me out of trouble.' We agreed, but said, 'You have to think about the rest of the family and our neighbours when you play.' That was the start. Ben's friends started coming over with their guitars and other instruments. Now, for several hours a week, our house is loud with music. But it's good for us too - my husband and I go for a walk while they practice. The band is friendly and polite, even if their music is not my favourite. They play at local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't do their schoolwork because of their music. But so far, that hasn't happened. I always remind Ben how important his schoolwork is. One thing is certain - Ben was right: it keeps him out of trouble and he's never bored.'"

'Atlantic College I visited Atlantic College in Wales, a special school that helps young people learn and grow. It's different from other schools because it lets students do activities outside the classroom to help them learn. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from many countries. They study in the morning and then do something useful in the afternoon, like helping on a farm or taking care of people who need help. 
The students come from different backgrounds and countries. Some students can't afford the fees, so the college offers help. About a quarter of the students are from the UK, and some of them get help from the government. 
I like that the college helps people understand each other. As one student said, ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don't like them. I didn't argue with my sister as much when I came back home."" 
In summary, Atlantic College gives its students a great education and it seems to work well.'"

I'm 32 years old and I just finished my first year at university. I have to go to lectures and read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university because I was bored with my job as a secretary. I was earning a good salary, but I didn't like the work. I was jealous of the students at the local university who looked happy and full of hope. Now that I'm a student, it's hard for me to make friends with my younger classmates. They often think I'm a teacher and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel different from the teachers because I know less than they do. But I'm glad I decided to go to university because it's important to have a good job. I prefer to read books on weekends instead of partying. As a student, I also get discounts for theatre and cinema tickets. Sometimes I worry about what I'll do after university, but I think it was a good decision to go back to school at my age.

Henry Ford was born in Michigan in 1863. He didn't like farming, so he started working as a mechanic when he was 15. In 1893, he built his first car. He drove it for 1,500 kilometers and then sold it. He built two more cars, and in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company.
Henry Ford wanted to make cars that ordinary people could buy. He used strong and light steel to make his cars cheaper. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T'. It was the first car that many people could afford. It cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day!
By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was very successful. Henry Ford's cars were simple and cheap, but sometimes that meant people didn't have many choices. Henry Ford said, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""
