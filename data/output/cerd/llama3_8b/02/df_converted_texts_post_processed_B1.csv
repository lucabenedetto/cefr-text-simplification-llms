Charging families for their trash seems like a good idea. It's environmentally friendly and makes sense financially. But it's not that simple. In many countries, people throw away a lot of trash because it's free. This is a problem because it costs money to collect and get rid of trash. The more trash people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more money the government has to spend.
To solve this problem, some cities have started charging people for their trash. They give out special stickers or tags that people attach to their trash bags. Only bags with these labels are picked up during collection. This seems like a good way to encourage people to throw away less trash and recycle more. But, as two American economists found out, it's not that easy.
They studied a town in Virginia where people were charged 80 cents for each trash bag. The number of bags did go down, but not because people were throwing away less trash. Instead, people were cramming more trash into each bag. This didn't help the environment because it made the trash harder to recycle.
Some people even started dumping their trash illegally instead of paying the fee. This is a big problem because it's hard to measure how much trash is being illegally dumped. The only good news is that more people started recycling, but this might not be because of the fee.
The economists also found that raising the price of trash bags doesn't really make a big difference. It might reduce the amount of trash by a little bit, but not by much. To really make a difference, people would need to buy less stuff and waste less. A small fee for trash might not be enough to make a big difference.
So, is charging families for their trash a good idea? It's not that simple. While it might not be the best solution, it's still better than having free disposal. But, we need to think about other factors that affect how much trash people throw away, like how much money they have and how much time they have to recycle."

Many people are not happy with their work. They feel that their job is not valued or understood. Even successful people often feel bitter about their fame. Loving your work is no longer enough. You have to ask yourself if your job is good for you as a person, for your mind, your character, and your relationships.
The question is important. If your job makes you a bore, unable to talk to people outside your field, and you have no time for wisdom, imagination, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for it.
I am trying to find ways to make work more fulfilling. I want to discover how work can be a path to a fuller life, to discovering new talents, and to meeting new people. But this does not mean abolishing unemployment. More people are educated and want jobs that are interesting and useful.
Even middle-class professions, such as doctors, accountants, and architects, are not as fulfilling as they used to be. People are stressed and unhappy in their jobs. This is because work has become too focused on making money, rather than making people happy.
Hotels are a good example. Many hotel workers are intelligent and lively, but they have low salaries and long hours. This is because hotels have not changed much since the 19th century. Hotels could be cultural centers, bringing people together from all over the world. Hotel staff could use their knowledge and skills, rather than just doing menial tasks.
Work is a relationship. People want to be independent and have their own choices. They need to be able to design their own jobs, choose their own colleagues, and customers. This means being able to communicate across different languages and cultures. Conversation is important, but it's not just about talking, it's about understanding and respecting each other.
Every conversation that achieves this can change the world, even if it's just a little bit."

""BROADCASTING: How Technology Shaped Society
The word 'broadcasting' comes from the idea of spreading seeds widely, by hand. It's a metaphor that means planned growth in many different places, with the possibility of a rich harvest. This idea assumes a central place where resources are available to spread and reproduce. The question is, why did a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically become organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor?
Television, as a technology, is related to other two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone. It's surprising that, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralized'mass' medium. However, sending signals to private homes from a central location fit with the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some alternative ideas and experiments, but they didn't succeed. In the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to use two-way television as an alternative to the telephone. They built their own transmitters and receivers, but big businesses and government intervened and made it difficult for these grassroots efforts to continue.
Television was also seen as a way to bring people together in public settings, especially in the USA. In Britain and Germany, people often watched TV in public places, rather than at home. However, the idea of a centralized, one-way broadcast system was more successful and became the standard.
The reason for this is that manufacturers wanted to sell TVs to households, and the idea of a centralized broadcast system fit with the way people lived and worked. As people's living standards improved, they wanted to have TVs in their homes, and the industry made it happen.
There is a connection between the way society modernized and the way broadcasting developed. As people moved around and became more mobile, they needed a way to stay connected and informed. Centralized broadcasting was seen as a way to reach everyone with important information and create a sense of national identity.
However, there are other ways to think about broadcasting, such as using it to promote democracy and equal access to information. This idea was important in shaping broadcasting policies between the wars, but it's not the only way to think about it."""

'Sometimes, people feel that no matter how many things they have, they are still not happy. This is because they want more. Advertisers use tricks to make us want things we don't really need. They make us feel like we are not good enough if we don't have something. But this is not true.
Caves are interesting natural wonders that scientists study. They want to know how they were formed, what lives in them, and how they affect our lives. Some people visit caves for fun, and they also help scientists learn more about them.
Weather forecasting has a long history. People used to watch the sky and notice patterns to predict the weather. Now, we have computers and satellites that help us know the weather quickly. But, we still need people to make sense of the data and give us good forecasts. Our own experiences and observations are important in understanding the weather.'

'Music and Theatre
I used to think that opera is mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I learned that music is actually more important. This makes sense, but I come from a world where words and actors are the main focus. In a concert hall or opera house, there are usually people who don't understand music very well. Some might feel embarrassed, while others are amazed by the performers' skills. A good musician takes years of hard work to develop their talent. Watching a top-class musician is like watching an athlete - we know they're doing something impressive, but it's not something we can do ourselves.
Theatre audiences are different. They don't always understand the skills of actors and aren't always impressed by what they do. They might ask questions like ""How do you learn all those lines?"" But this doesn't mean theatre audiences are less generous or demanding than music audiences. In fact, many people are the same.
The question is, can music learn from theatre about how to connect with the audience? I think so. I've seen how a different approach can make a big difference. Music is already theatrical, with passion, humour, and intimacy. But the way music is presented often emphasizes the difference between the performers and the audience, which can feel hierarchical. Sometimes, audiences applaud between movements or after a difficult piece, which can disrupt the performance.
Is there a solution? Of course, there is. Many people are working to bring new audiences to concerts and opera houses and to make music more accessible. I remember a special event where a community opera was performed in a cathedral and then in the town. It was an amazing experience, with professional musicians and a sense of community. What I'd like to see in music is a bit more of the risk and creativity that theatre can display. Sometimes, this comes from using unusual locations or unexpected settings. This can be challenging, but it can also be powerful.
I believe that music and theatre can both thrive and bring joy to more people if we change the way we experience them.'"

I don't like sand very much. It's annoying because it gets everywhere and makes a mess. When I'm at the beach, it blows in my face and gets into my food. It also sticks to my skin when I'm wet and is hard to remove. But when I sit on a towel or get into a car, the sand falls off. It's strange because it stays with me for a long time and makes a mess everywhere I go.
Finding a safe and secure home is important for everyone. We want to feel safe and protected from harm. Locks and keys have been used for this purpose for a long time. Even with modern technology, many people prefer the feeling of turning a physical key to unlock a door. A company that makes locks and keys recently created a new electronic system, but they also included a physical key for people who prefer it.
I was nervous about visiting the modern art gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some of it, but I'm not sure why. The gallery tried to help visitors understand the art by providing labels and information about each piece. This helped me understand what the art was trying to say and what it meant. Before, I just looked at the pictures without knowing what they meant.

Making movies from books can be a challenging process. It involves cutting out parts of the story, dialogue, and descriptions to make it fit for the screen. This can be frustrating, but it can also be interesting. I recently worked on a script and noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and description without changing the main message. This doesn't mean the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's just that the way we pay attention to stories is different in books and movies.
Movies can be very engaging. When we watch a movie, we feel like we're part of the story. It's like being transported to a different world. But when the movie ends, we snap back to reality. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent watching the movie.
Some people don't think movies are a real art form. They see them as just entertainment. But many people, including film studios, think otherwise.
Film studios can be confusing. They often have many small rooms with similar-looking doors. It can be hard to find your way around. But people who work there usually know their way around.
Many people want to make movies. There are books and courses to help them learn. Some people even make successful movies with low budgets. Robert Rodriguez made a movie called El Mariachi for just $7,000. It was a big success and helped him become a well-known director.
In the past, film directors had to work their way up to become successful. They started by working behind the scenes and making smaller movies. Now, with the rise of independent filmmaking, people can make movies without the support of big studios. They have to be more self-sufficient and take risks.

In the past, the council houses in West Earlham were lined up in rows. They were made of orange brick or pale stucco and had a strong smell from a nearby factory. In the morning, you could see a paperboy walking down the street with a look of disgust on his face.
I don't remember much about my childhood, but I do remember sitting on a windowsill and looking at the houses going away into the distance. Later, I remember seeing my mother ironing clothes in a back room. She was a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, but I knew she didn't like it when I did something wrong.
My mother was a solitary person who liked to do things her way. She had a lot of rules, like not playing in other people's gardens or not talking loudly. She also liked to listen to the radio and sit quietly in the living room. Sometimes she would take me to the city center or to the park. I remember seeing a man who used to tell stories about his time in the navy and a charity fair where I got lemonade and tried to help a charity.
My mother didn't like politicians and thought they were only looking for money. She didn't like it when people tried to help others, and she didn't like it when I did something wrong. She was strict and liked to make sure I did things her way.
Sometimes, my mother would take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at paintings. She wasn't very interested in art, but she liked to go to the museum because it was free. Once, she saw a picture of a Roman soldier and said, ""I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was the only time I remember her trying to make a joke.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The street was quiet and misty, making me feel like I was walking in secret. I knew this side of the street from when I was a child. There were many houses with porches and gardens, and I used to play with my friends who lived there. As I walked, I noticed that the houses got smaller and the gardens got smaller too. Over time, some houses that were once homes became stores, and some stores became homes. I wondered how people lived in these spaces and what it was like to have all those old smells from the stores.
I visited my friend Rick Gilbert, who lives in a former warehouse. He wanted to make his home feel cozy, so he put up a big sheet of plastic to divide the space. He also wanted a special area for cooking and a place to work. He chose a light-colored wood for the floor and added some comfortable chairs and sofas. He also kept some sentimental furniture given to him by his parents.
I also thought about a famous writer named Bruce Chatwin, who loved to travel and write about his adventures. He wrote a book called ""In Patagonia"" that was very imaginative and exciting. He liked to mix fact and fiction in his writing, which made his stories even more interesting.
One summer, I was swimming in my pool during a big rainstorm. The rain was heavy and the pool was filled with bubbles. I loved swimming in the rain and feeling like I was a part of nature.

Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But sometimes I like to get off the beaten path and do things my own way. Swimming is a way for me to connect with nature and feel free."

Here is a simplified version of the passage for a B1 learner:
Charles Darwin thought that people cry for no special reason. But scientists later found that crying is important for building strong relationships. For example, a scientist named John Bowlby said that crying helps babies and their mothers connect. Many people think that children cry when they feel helpless. But why do adults still cry? It seems that the sound of crying isn't as important as the way it looks. In the past, crying might have helped early human communities feel more connected and trust each other. We might also cry to show sympathy for people who are suffering unfairly. Sometimes we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. We might cry when we watch a sad movie, but it's more likely to happen when we're with others. It's clear that crying is important for social connections, but scientists are still learning more about it.

The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. It's not clear how much warmer it will get or how it will affect our lives. A warmer climate will change the weather all over the world. This will have big effects on plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support a big population. Any changes to these resources are important.
We don't know exactly how the world will change or what's causing it. We do know that human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are building up and may already be affecting the climate. Scientists are trying to understand the relationship between these gases and temperature.
Computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) help scientists predict what will happen in the future. These programs use laws of physics and chemistry to analyze the interaction of temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, they are not perfect and have some limitations. Despite these limitations, most scientists agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we've experienced before.
The predictions suggest that the average global temperature will rise by 1-3.5°C by 2100. Sea levels will also rise by 15-95 cm. There will be changes in the patterns of rain and snowfall, and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts will become more common.
Climate change will affect the natural environment and humans. It can change the places where plants and animals live, and the mix of species they have. This can affect the food we eat, the water we drink, and the places we live. Some areas will be more affected than others. Some changes will be good, but many will be bad.
For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have led to better wheat yields. However, many changes will be bad. Small changes in climate can affect the availability of water, leading to droughts and shortages. This will be a problem in areas where water is already scarce.
The melting of glaciers will also have big effects. This will change the places where plants and animals live, and affect human structures and facilities. In the Arctic, the ice cover may melt completely, making it easier to transport goods and extract oil and gas, but also increasing the risk of icebergs.
The most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the expansion of the ocean and the melting of ice. Many people live in coastal areas, so this will have big consequences. There will be more flooding and damage to homes and cities. Many people will lose their homes and livelihoods, and this could lead to many environmental refugees. This will be especially severe for small island states, where entire countries could disappear if the worst happens."

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a B1 learner:
The problem with understanding art is that we often focus too much on the physical objects themselves, like paintings or buildings, rather than what they do to us and how they make us feel. This can make it hard to understand the true meaning of art. Additionally, some art is so famous and well-known that it can be hard to see it in a new light. When we separate art from the everyday experiences that it is a part of, it can become isolated and difficult to understand.
To truly understand art, we need to connect it to the everyday experiences and emotions that it evokes. This means looking beyond the physical objects and considering the events, scenes, and emotions that they represent. We need to see art as part of our everyday lives, rather than as something separate and isolated.
For example, many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comic strips, which are often considered to be ""low-brow"" forms of art. However, these forms of art can be just as enjoyable and meaningful as more traditional forms of art. The key is to appreciate the aesthetic qualities of these everyday experiences and to see how they can enrich our lives.
Ultimately, the goal of art is to connect with us on an emotional level and to make us feel something. To truly understand art, we need to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to see it in a new light."

Advertising in Trouble
The early 1990s were a tough time for people who work in advertising. The economy was in a bad state, and many companies were struggling to stay afloat. In the UK, the economy was declining, interest rates were high, and people were losing their jobs. Many businesses, including advertising agencies, were affected. Some industries, like the car and building trades, saw a 30% drop in sales.
Advertising people were under a lot of pressure. They were expected to do more with less, and to come up with creative ideas on a tight budget. On top of that, they had to deal with the challenge of convincing clients that their advertising was worth the money. Some clients were questioning whether advertising was really effective, and whether they were getting a good return on their investment.
The industry was going through a lot of change. New technologies, changing consumer habits, and new regulations were making it harder for advertisers to reach their target audience. Some companies were trying to cut costs by reducing their advertising budgets, while others were looking for new ways to get their message across.

Music in the Future
Technology is changing the way we live, work, and have fun. This includes music. In the past, people had more opportunities to listen to music on the radio, TV, records, and CDs. At the same time, there were fewer chances for people to see live music performances and for musicians to work full-time.
It's likely that we will continue to have more ways to listen to music and more opportunities to make music. Music is important for many people and is a big part of our culture. It's hard to imagine a world without music.
The music industry is important for the economy and musicians will continue to be needed in different professions. Playing a musical instrument can also help people develop important skills, such as spatial reasoning and concentration.
Research has shown that playing an instrument can be good for children and young people, helping them with social skills and concentration. It can also help them develop good study habits and be more punctual.
In the future, music may become more diverse and people may use technology to make and perform music. This could make it easier for people to make music, but it might also mean that there are fewer jobs for musicians who only perform live.
To prepare for this future, music teachers will need to adapt their teaching methods to help more people learn to play a range of instruments throughout their lives. Musicians will need to be able to teach people of all ages, work with large groups, and have good communication and management skills.
It's important for everyone involved in music education to work together to raise the profile of music and make sure that people appreciate its value."

A long time ago, some people called bloggers started sharing their lives online. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories, and this was new and exciting. But they also faced problems, like losing friends and getting into trouble. They learned that sharing too much online can be a mistake.
One blogger, Justin Hall, started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his daily life, including his relationships and thoughts. He wanted to be honest and open, but this caused problems. He had to stop sharing his life online because it affected his relationships.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, started sharing her life online in 2002. She wrote about her job and her personal life. But someone sent her blog to her bosses, and she lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person. But our online lives are connected to our real lives, and we have to be careful what we share.
Heather Armstrong learned a lesson from her experience. She realized that she didn't have to share everything online. She stopped blogging for a while, got married, and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is a successful blogger and writer.
The lesson is that we can say anything online, but we don't have to. We should be careful and think about the consequences of what we share."

Many people today are tired and sleepless. In the United States, 40 million people have a problem sleeping. This is because they are busy and wake up early to avoid traffic. Researchers have been studying sleep and its effects on people. They found that people need more sleep, especially when they are busy. In fact, a sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night. They took three weeks to get used to sleeping for 8 hours a night.
There is a sleep research laboratory at a university in England. They study how sleep affects people, such as sailors and drivers. They also study how noise from airports and motorways affects sleep. They recruit volunteers from the university and pay them £5 an hour to take part in the research.
The laboratory has a special room that simulates a motorway. The volunteers are asked to drive while answering questions. The researcher, Dr. Reyner, has a video recording of one volunteer trying not to fall asleep. At first, the person is awake and alert, but then they start to blink and nod off. The car starts to move off the road, and the person wakes up with a start.
Dr. Reyner found that two cups of coffee can help people stay awake for half an hour. She recommends energy drinks and chewing gum to help people stay alert. She also thinks that shift workers could benefit from these products.
There are some things that we know about sleep. We know that humans sleep in a daily cycle, with four different stages of sleep. We also know that our brain paralyses our body while we are sleeping to prevent injuries. However, there are many things that we don't know about sleep, such as whether it repairs our body or restores our muscles.
Some researchers think that sleep is important for our brain and creativity. Others think that it helps us travel through time without injury. There are also differences in sleep patterns between men and women, and between older and younger people.
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. In Britain, people used to sleep in two parts, with a break in the middle of the night. This was a time for reflection and relaxation. However, with the introduction of artificial light and the industrial revolution, people started sleeping for longer periods at night. Today, people all over the world are struggling to get enough sleep."

I wore my new cowboy boots, worth $800 each, in the Arizona desert. I felt like a real cowboy, but I wasn't one. I flew in from Denver and felt like I was in a different world.

""Citizen Kane is a famous film that came out in 1941. It was not a big success when it first came out, but it became famous later because of television. Many people think it's the most inspiring film for people who want to make movies. This is surprising because it was the first film made by Orson Welles.
Welles said that he was able to make the film because he didn't know what he was allowed to do, so he just did it. He had a great team working with him, including a camera man, a screenwriter, and a special effects expert.
The film is about a newspaper owner who is like William Randolph Hearst. Welles thought this was a great idea because he could play the role of the director and the actor. He was very excited about the project.
The story is about a man who says he might be late and doesn't want his wife to worry. He goes to the golf club to talk to someone and his wife is a bit worried. She says she has nothing to do and might go shopping. The man tells her to enjoy herself and not to worry about him.
Now, let's talk about job titles. A recent study found that job titles can cause envy and problems at work. Most employers and employees agree that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Shockingly, 70% of office workers would rather have a more'motivational' job title than a pay rise. This shows that people are very concerned about their job titles. The truth is that nobody wants to be seen as subordinate. The job titles we use today focus on ability, but they are just fancy words.""

I went to Vienna to take photos. Taking photos is my job. I love capturing special moments and scenes. Sometimes, I take a photo that becomes famous and people all over the world want to use it. This happened to me once, and it was a lucky break. After that, I became a freelance photographer, which means I work for myself and choose my own projects.
I was in Vienna to take photos for a book about four European cities - London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had already taken photos in London, and now it was my turn to take photos in Vienna. The Austrian publisher liked my work, so they asked me to take over the job from another photographer who had left the project.
I stayed at a hotel in the center of Vienna and spent my days exploring the city and taking photos. I wanted to capture the beauty of Vienna in the winter, so I went out early in the morning to take pictures of the snow-covered streets and buildings.
Photography is a special way of capturing moments in time. It's like magic, because you can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a beautiful photo. Even when you know how it works, you still feel a sense of wonder. That's what makes photography so exciting.
On my first day in Vienna, I just walked around the city, taking in the sights and sounds. The weather was cold and grey, but it was perfect for taking photos. I knew that I would take some great shots, and I was excited to see what I could capture."

Here is a simplified version of the text, making it accessible to a B1 level learner:
The Hayward Gallery in London has become a magical place. It's not because of a big, flashy show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is about movement and action in art. The exhibition shows how artists have been interested in movement for the last 60 years. You can see many different artworks, including paintings, drawings, and videos. The curator, Guy Brett, has brought all these artworks together to show how movement has been an important part of art.
Some people like David Hockney's art because it's easy to understand and it's about everyday things. But some critics think his art is not important. Hockney doesn't care what others think and believes that his art has a purpose.
I recently saw many art exhibitions, and some were very good, while others were not so good. What bothered me was when exhibitions had a hidden message or tried to tell me what to think. I wanted to create an exhibition that was different. I took over a space with seven artists and asked them to create individual artworks that didn't have a connection with each other. The result was ""Window-shopping"", a show that was just about art being art.
Some people think that analyzing art can spoil the experience. They think that art historians, who study art, focus too much on theory and forget about the pleasure of looking at art. But knowing more about art can actually make it more enjoyable. Our likes and dislikes are also influenced by the society we live in.

'Metals People may have first wanted to use metals because they liked the way they looked. Maybe someone was sitting by a river, waiting for fish to come close, and found a shiny yellow stone. It didn't feel like a rock, so they picked it up. This might be how people first found gold. Because gold is soft, it was soon very popular. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. When people found out how useful copper tools were, they started looking for more copper and ways to get it out of the ground. This was an important discovery for our ancestors.
St Ives It was quiet as we walked down the street in St Ives. The wind was strong and the sea was rough. We were the only ones outside, and all the shops were closed. We had taken a small train to get to St Ives and watched the weather get worse. We had planned to visit Cornwall, but now it didn't seem like a good idea. We wanted to walk along the beach and have cozy evenings by the fire. 
Computer Modelling Studying the past is hard because it's already happened. We can't talk to the people who lived in the past or ask them why they made certain choices. Archaeologists find clues, but we can't test our ideas with people who are still alive. However, we can use computers to create a virtual world with people who behave like real people. We can make rules for them and see how they react to different situations. This can help us understand the past better.'

**Vervet Monkeys**
One day, a strange male monkey came to a group of vervet monkeys that scientists were studying. He wanted to join the group, but the dominant male was not happy about it. The dominant male had an idea to keep the stranger away. Whenever the stranger came close, the dominant male would make a loud noise to scare him away. The stranger would run back to his own trees.
This worked well until the dominant male made a mistake. He made the loud noise while walking across the open ground himself. The stranger was not fooled this time and came closer.
**Cats**
In a village in England, people counted how many animals their cats caught. They found that 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals in one year. Some people thought that all the cats in Britain must catch 100 million animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in cities and don't catch many animals. The important question is whether the number of animals they catch is too many. The answer is no, because many people feed birds and provide homes for them, so the bird population is healthy.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a B1 learner:
Photography has been used to capture human life and events for over a century and a half. During this time, photography has become better at recording moments in time and space, allowing us to see things that are far away or very small. It has also shown us images of the world, the solar system, and modern life. Photography is an important way to express human feelings and thoughts.
The idea of using pictures to record events is not new. People have been making pictures for thousands of years. We don't know exactly why they did it, but it seems that pictures are connected to human culture.
When photography was invented, it changed the way people saw the world. People thought that photographs were a truthful way to show what was real. They thought that the camera was like the human eye, capturing a moment in time.
However, photography is not just a simple way to show what is real. It is also influenced by culture and can be used to express different ideas and feelings. This means that people from different cultures may not always understand photographs in the same way.
Photography has changed a lot since it was first invented. It used to be used to record everyday life, but now it is used to show us the world in new and different ways. Photographs can be used to tell us about the past and to help us understand the world around us. They can also be used to bring about change and make us think about important issues.

**Writing Poetry and Short Stories**
Writing poetry and short stories can be challenging. It's like walking through a minefield - you need to be careful not to make mistakes. The most important thing is to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination run free. Some people need a stable life before they can write, while others can write even in difficult times. Everyone has their own way of writing, and it's important not to follow someone else's rules.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you need to be careful not to include too many characters or too much detail. Flashbacks should be short and only used if they help to explain something important. One way to do this is to have a character remember something from their past that helps them understand the current situation. Dialogue is also important because it can show two different opinions in a short time, which can be more interesting than having one person explain everything.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves carefully. As you get more experienced, you'll start to see patterns and strategies that can help you write a good story.
**Language**
Language is a natural part of human communication, but writing is not. Children learn language easily, but writing is something that needs to be taught. We need to understand how children learn language and how to help them learn to write.

I'm not sure if I should write this book. It's not a typical story with a beginning, middle, and end. I'm just writing about a man I knew, but I don't know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could make things up to make the story more interesting, but I don't want to do that. I just want to tell the truth.
I've changed the names of the people in the story to protect their privacy. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and it's possible that he never will be. If that's the case, my book will only be interesting because of its own value. But maybe the way he lived and the kind of person he was will have a lasting impact on others, and people will want to learn more about him.
I've written down conversations between the man and me, but I didn't take notes. I have a good memory, so I'm sure what was said is accurate. I've also added some words to the conversations to make them sound more natural. This is something that historians do to make their stories more believable.
I'm a bit worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from another country, because they are shaped by their upbringing, education, and experiences. You can't just read about it or hear about it from someone else - you have to live it yourself. That's why I've never written about people from other countries before. But in this book, I'm trying to be honest and show the man as I saw him.

'POETRY RECITALS
At any time, people who are living through it may think that the literary scene is confusing. It's only later, in hindsight, that we can see the important poets and their styles clearly. Right now, there are many different types of poetry being written, and many different ways of presenting and teaching it. Some poets write for the page, while others perform their work in front of an audience.
There is a big debate about the role of poetry in society. Some poets think that poetry should be performed in front of people, while others think it should be written down and read quietly. This debate is not just about the poetry itself, but also about the way it is presented and taught.
Despite this debate, poetry readings have become more popular over the past few decades. Small groups of people in towns and cities organize readings in community centers or private homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to their students. Arts festivals also feature poetry readings.
The consequences of these events are not always clear. For some poets, performing in front of an audience is the best way to share their work. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand, and they can be enjoyed immediately. However, for other poets who write complex and subtle poetry, performing in front of an audience can be challenging. They may feel pressure to simplify their work to make it more accessible, which can be a problem.
Attending a poetry reading can be a fun and educational experience, but it's not a substitute for reading poetry on the page. Hearing a good poet read their work can help us understand the emphasis and rhythm of the poem, but it's best if the audience has already read the poem beforehand. The main reason for popular poetry recitals is to make poetry more enjoyable and accessible to a wider audience.'"

**Oral History**
When historians ask people about the past, they need to be careful. The person telling the story might not always tell the truth. The historian chooses who to talk to and what questions to ask. Even if the historian doesn't ask questions, just being there can affect what the person remembers. The historian's own thoughts and ideas can also influence what they hear.
When the historian is not there, the person telling the story might remember things that they learned from others or TV. They might also remember things in a way that is not accurate. The way people feel about the past can be important, but it's not always true.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals. One way is to look at how their bodies work. The other way is to study how animals behave in their natural environment.
Some scientists focus on how animals learn and behave in a lab. Others study how animals behave in the wild. Both types of scientists are important.
**Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you need to learn two things at once. You need to learn about the subject itself and how to study it. Social sciences are not just common sense. Each subject has its own way of thinking and its own methods.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was an art that followed rules about order, arrangement, and proportion. The ancient Romans believed that architecture was important for its beauty, not just its usefulness.
The origins of classical architecture are complex. People built simple houses and huts before the sophisticated buildings we see today. These early buildings still influenced the way architects designed later buildings.

'Online Book Reviews: A New Way to Share Opinions
When the Internet first became popular, people thought it would be a great way for anyone to share their ideas and opinions. And that's exactly what happened with book reviews. Amazon, a big online bookshop, let anyone write a review of a book. This was a big change from the past, when only professional critics could write reviews.
Amazon's system was simple: anyone could write a review and give a book up to five stars. The reviews would appear on the book's page, so readers could see what others thought of the book. This was a great way for readers to get a sense of whether a book was worth reading or not.
But with so many people writing reviews, some people started to be a bit naughty. They would write fake reviews, either to praise their own books or to criticize others. Amazon tried to stop this by having a team of editors check the reviews. They looked for things like reviews that were too short or too mean.
Some authors even tried to write fake reviews to help their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was so upset by the bad reviews of his book that he wrote some fake ones to try to make it look better. But he got caught and the fake reviews were taken down.
Despite the problems, most people took book reviews seriously. They wanted to help others make good choices about what to read. And overall, the reviews on Amazon were very helpful. In fact, they were often more accurate than the reviews written by professional critics.
The writer George Orwell once said that writing too many book reviews was boring because you had to pretend to like books you didn't really care about. But with online book reviews, anyone can share their genuine opinions and help others discover new books.'

Art has changed a lot over the last 200 years. People now expect artists to be unique and shocking. We praise artists who were not understood in the past. But when it comes to art today, we often don't understand it and think it's not art anymore. We expect artists to be special and talented, and we get upset if they don't follow the rules.
I want to tell you a story and ask a question about it. Imagine an artist who asks someone to write a simple text on a canvas. The text says that there are many kinds of pictures. The artist then asks someone else to paint the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: is this a painting?
Many artists have to follow the same style to be successful. They have to keep making the same kind of art that people like. But some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have broken the rules and been successful. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something new. He used to paint still lifes, but now he paints pictures of the London Underground.
I'm going to describe a scene from a novel. A man has escaped to a remote island and is living alone. He is not happy or unhappy; he is just suspended in his memories. He talks about the importance of art in our lives. He says that through art, we can reorder reality and find meaning in our lives. For artists, art is a way to fulfill our true potential and find joy, rather than trying to escape our problems.

Heritage is important because it helps people feel connected to the past. We often learn about our family's heritage from our grandparents and ancestors. Knowing about our past can help us understand our present and future. Heritage is like a link to our history, and it makes us feel part of something bigger than ourselves.
In the past, people passed down stories and legends to each other. But nowadays, many of these stories are lost because people moved away from their communities. Instead, we can learn about our past by visiting places and looking at old buildings.
I wrote a book about a place called the Fens in England. It's a strange and special place that not many people know about. The Fens are flat and empty, but they're also full of life and mystery.
Museums are important because they help us learn about the past. They should make their collections easy to understand and accessible to everyone. Museums are special because they have real objects from the past, not just replicas. They help us connect with the past and understand what life was like before.
People want to preserve things because it makes them feel safe and stable. Change can be scary, but it's a natural part of life. We need to learn how to handle change and make our towns better for the future.

Writing Reviews: A Special Job
Frank Kermode, a well-known writer, talks about the art of writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and are only published for a short time. They are usually short and are meant for a general audience. However, writing reviews is a skilled job that requires a lot of knowledge and writing ability.
A reviewer needs to consider many things, such as the length of the review, the audience, and the topic. They must also be able to write clearly and simply, so that readers can understand their opinions. Some reviewers write reviews as a way to share their thoughts with others, while others do it as a way to make a living.
Many writers, including famous authors like John Updike, enjoy writing reviews. They see it as a way to share their opinions and insights with others. Some reviewers, like professors, may write reviews as part of their job. They may write reviews for academic journals or newspapers.
Writing reviews can be a challenging job, but it can also be rewarding. A good reviewer can help readers discover new books and ideas, and can provide insight into the world of literature."

Ralph walked into his flat and felt a familiar feeling of ownership. It was a feeling he still got sometimes, even after three years of living there. When he first moved in, he would come home early, eager to see what had happened while he was away. The flat was his own space, where he could relax and be himself.
Ralph used to worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat was always the same when he got home. It was either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. He started to think of it as an extension of himself, a place where he could be alone and think.
Sometimes, Ralph would find a pile of letters by the door or a blinking answering machine. He was grateful that nothing was broken or damaged. He looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the busy office.
Ralph often felt lonely at work, but when he was at home, he felt more himself. He would read or listen to music, but sometimes he would wonder why he was doing these things. He felt like he had lost his sense of direction and purpose.
Ralph had tried to make a plan for his life after university, but he didn't have a clear goal. He took a job at a local newspaper because it was available, but he didn't think about whether it was the right fit for him. His boss, Neil, offered him the job on the spot, and Ralph took it without thinking about the long-term consequences.

Some things cannot be rushed. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you're impatient and add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it will curdle. If you're frustrated and tug on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. Our minds work at different speeds too. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. Some things can be sped up, like solving puzzles or doing math in your head. But others can't be rushed, and if you try to, they will break down or get tangled up.
We think, learn, and know in different ways. Some ways are fast, and some are slow. We need both fast and slow thinking. When we're in a tricky situation, we need to think quickly and react fast. But when we're trying to solve a problem or make a big decision, we need to think slowly and carefully.
Our minds have three main ways of thinking. One is fast and instinctive, like when you react to a sudden danger. Another is slow and thoughtful, like when you're solving a puzzle or making a plan. The third is slow and relaxing, like when you're daydreaming or meditating. This last way of thinking is important for creativity and wisdom.
Scientists are now studying how our minds work in these different ways. They're finding that our unconscious mind can do some amazing things if we give it time. It can learn patterns that we can't see, make sense of complicated things, and solve problems that are too hard for our conscious mind.

Birds have always been important in human culture. We love them, fear them, and sometimes worship them. But what does this say about us? I was sitting in my greenhouse when I saw a little brown bird, a wren, bumping against the glass. It's an important bird in British culture. In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could predict their luck. Today, you can still see pictures and ceramics of wrens in many British homes.
Wrens have been a part of British culture for a long time. They are often seen as a symbol of good luck. A forest without wrens is a sad and empty place. This is because we have a deep connection with birds that goes back to a time when people relied on nature for their survival. When people are closely connected to nature, they develop a special way of understanding and communicating about animals. This connection is important and can change over time.
For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed it bread. But soon, people started to see it as a pest, and it almost disappeared. Now, it's a symbol of conservation efforts and is being reintroduced to help it thrive again.
Our relationship with animals is more than just cultural; it's also connected to our human nature. We're fascinated by birds because they can fly, sing, and are free. This fascination is a way for us to understand ourselves and our place in nature. Some people might think these feelings are old-fashioned and no longer important, but they're still a part of us.
Birds are now used as indicators of environmental change and the quality of our ecosystem. Unfortunately, many bird species are in danger, and this is a cultural loss as well as an environmental one. These birds carry a lot of cultural significance, and their loss is a reminder of our connection to nature.
Folklore and stories about birds are important because they help us understand and connect with nature in a way that science can't. Whether we watch bird videos or observe birds in our backyard, we're drawn to them in ways that are hard to explain. The stories we tell about birds are a way of interpreting what they're trying to tell us. The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of this connection and the mystery that lies between the present and the past."

Maps help us understand how different places and features on the Earth's surface are connected. This is done by showing distances and directions. In the past, people used different ways to measure distance, such as 'a day's journey' or 'a few hours' walk'. But these methods didn't always give accurate information about the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for people who were just trying to find their way, it was more important to know where to go and how far it was than to know the exact direction.
For a long time, written guides were more popular than maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, don't always show the exact direction. Landmarks along a route were often marked with signs, and their size indicated their importance. The way maps were drawn varied depending on their purpose and the place they were made. To understand old maps, it's important to know the conventions used.
The history of cartography is about how people have become better at measuring distance and direction and including more information on maps. Cartographers have used ideas from other sciences, like astronomy and magnetism, to make their work more accurate. As people explored the world and learned more about it, they tried to make more detailed maps.
Different people have used maps for different reasons. Travelers, merchants, soldiers, and scientists all needed maps for different purposes. Cartographers had to adapt to these changing needs and develop new ways of making maps. Today, maps are used in many fields, from geology to history. The study of old maps is important because it helps us understand how people thought and worked in the past.

Climate and weather are important for animals and plants. They can affect the kind of landscape we see. For example, warm and wet weather helps tropical jungles grow, which are full of many different species. Cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things.

Dealing with Metals I used to work as a metals dealer for 20 years. I was good at buying and selling metals and making money. Metals are not as tightly controlled as other things, so it's possible to make a lot of money if you take risks and understand the market.

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special primate called the aye-aye. It eats insects that live inside wood, just like woodpeckers. The aye-aye uses its teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long finger to find the insects. Scientists have been studying how the aye-aye finds its food. They wanted to know if it uses its eyes, nose, or ears to find the insects.
The scientists tested the aye-aye by giving it logs with holes. Some holes had mealworms inside, and others were empty. The aye-aye went straight for the holes with mealworms, even if there were no signs on the surface. The scientists thought maybe the aye-aye was using its sense of smell or hearing to find the mealworms, but it didn't seem to be using those senses either.
The scientists then noticed that the aye-aye was gnawing at empty holes as well as holes with mealworms. They realized that the aye-aye must be feeling the hole itself. When the aye-aye is searching for food, it taps the wood with its finger and brings its big ears forward. This helps it to listen for the sound of the tap and feel the vibrations of the wood.

Most people have photos of their grandparents, but few know much about their lives when they were young. We often mean to write down our stories, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a way to keep people's stories alive. She writes books about ordinary people's lives. She talks to them, records their stories, and writes a book about their life. The books are over 20,000 words long and include pictures.
Hannah started this project because she realized that she was losing touch with her own family's past. She talks to people from all walks of life and finds that they have interesting stories to tell. She promises them that their stories will be kept confidential, so they feel comfortable sharing things they might not have told anyone else.
One man she interviewed was 62 years old and had made and lost a lot of money. He was surprised by how much he shared with her. He talked about his divorce and how it still hurt him. He also realized that he had repeated patterns from his childhood, like making the same mistakes over and over.
Hannah has found that many people's childhood experiences shape their lives. They might make the same mistakes or choose the same kind of people to date because of what their parents taught them. She also finds that people often regret or resent things from their past that were never resolved with their parents.
Hannah is not nosy or trying to get gossip. She just wants to help people keep their stories alive. She uses the recordings to write the books, rearranging the stories to make them easy to read. The books are not cheap, but they are well-made and have a professional look.
Hannah gets about 10 inquiries a week, but many people are put off by the price. She thought her books would be more affordable, but they are popular among a certain type of person who values their family history."

**Science in Space: A Unique Experiment**
Journalist Tom Mumford joined 13 students from Europe and America on a special flight to test their scientific theories. The plane looked normal from outside, but inside, it was different. The seats were removed, and there were no windows, only lights on the walls. The students were excited and a bit nervous. They had won a competition to be on this unique flight.
The plane, a Boeing KC-135, went up and down, up and down, creating a kind of weightlessness. The students felt like they were floating. They conducted experiments to see how things behave in space. One group tested how a robotic cat moves in zero gravity. Another group looked at how metal joins change when there is no gravity. They wanted to use this knowledge to build space stations.
The students also tried to make special solar sails that use the sun's energy. They believe these sails could help satellites travel through space. After two hours, the students felt exhilarated and excited. One student said, ""This was an unforgettable experience. I want to be an astronaut even more now.""

I had a strange period in my life when I didn't have any summers. I would go to New Zealand every summer, which is their winter. My parents thought it would be a good idea for my brother, sister, and me to plant trees on a small piece of land we owned. They said, ""If you take the time to plant the trees, you can have the land."" We wanted to keep a connection to New Zealand because my father grew up there. We found a piece of land near Auckland and started planting trees. I was very excited because I had worked on farms before and loved the idea of planting trees.
It was a lot of hard work, but I enjoyed it. We planted 70 acres of trees over four years. The weather was not good at first, but it didn't stop us. We got used to the rain and the cold. It was a special time, and I think about it often. I learned a lot about trees and the natural world.
After we finished planting, I went back to New Zealand four times to see how the trees were growing. It was very satisfying to see them grow and thrive. I still worry about the weather in New Zealand, especially when I read about big storms or droughts. But everything turned out well, and the trees are now 20 years old.
I even wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" while I was back in New Zealand. I stayed in a small cabin on the farm and wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. The connection I made with that place is still very strong. It's a special bond between people and the earth."

**Bringing Up Badgers**
My husband and I have a dairy farm in Somerset, and we've become known for helping orphaned animals. One day, one of my helpers brought me a cardboard box with three small grey badger cubs inside. They were only eight inches long and had milky-coloured eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. They were cold and whimpering, but we took care of them and fed them with a syringe. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.
At first, we fed them every four hours, but soon they were eating from a bottle and moving around. They seemed happy with each other and a warm blanket. After three weeks, Willow, the male cub, seemed lethargic, but we didn't notice until it was too late. He died from a lung infection.
We were sad, but we continued to care for the other two. Later, a local farmer brought us another male cub, Willow II. He was smaller and harder to feed, but we managed to help him. The cubs grew and became more independent. By August, they were eating solid food and going on nocturnal walks with us.
We noticed other badgers in our field, and we were warned that they might attack our cubs. So, we built a special enclosure for them with tunnels and a badger gate. The cubs loved their new home and spent their days exploring and playing. Eventually, they moved in and settled down.
Now, my walks with them are less frequent, especially since they're not fully awake until midnight. I still see Bluebell and Willow II sometimes, and they always greet me before going off into the night. This is their territory now, and they've made it their home.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to sail across the Atlantic Ocean to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley. Halley was a famous astronomer who lived over 200 years ago. He is known for discovering a comet, but he also did important work on navigation. Halley wanted to find the difference between the direction the compass points and the true north. This was important because it helped sailors navigate the oceans.
Halley went on two voyages to measure this difference. The first voyage was cut short because of problems with his crew, but he went again and collected important data. He used this data to create a map that showed the difference between magnetic north and true north. This map was very useful for sailors for many years.
Now, Dr. Clark wants to repeat Halley's journey to update the map. He will use special instruments to measure the difference between magnetic north and true north. This will help scientists understand how the Earth's magnetic field is changing. Dr. Clark is excited about the journey and feels that it will be a great way to honor Halley's memory.

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for a B1 level learner:
Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How do these birds get away with having such extravagant feathers when they live in a competitive world where only the strongest survive?
Scientists from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to try to solve this mystery. They want to know if the hens really choose the males with the most impressive tails. And if so, whether these males have any special qualities that help them survive better.
The scientists have been observing the peacocks and taking pictures. They found that the hens do like the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. But they still don't know if these males are also healthier or more resistant to diseases.
One scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that showy male birds are often healthier and that their bright feathers advertise their good health. The scientists at Whipsnade are trying to test this idea by comparing the babies of attractive and unattractive males.
There is another idea that might explain why peacocks have such beautiful tails. It's called ""Fisher's Runaway"". It says that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the others, their sons will inherit their father's tail and their daughters will like long tails too. This can create a cycle where the males with the longest tails get more mates and leave more babies, and the females prefer longer tails too. This could be the reason why peacocks have such beautiful tails.
This idea might also explain why females choose males with beautiful tails, even if it doesn't seem logical to us. The females are not choosing the males just because they look good, but because they are actually choosing the males that are healthier and more likely to survive."

'MY DREAM BOAT
I believe that the best boat combines old and new ideas. I built my own boat, ""The Westerman"", using this approach. It's a beautiful boat that looks like it's from the past, but it also has modern features.
The boat show in London has many new yachts with advanced technology. But my boat is different. It's not as flashy, but it's perfect for me. I designed it with a coal stove for warmth and cozy berths for sleeping. I wanted a boat that feels like a boat, not a house on the water.
I used to sail a boat called Hirta, which was very comfortable, but not luxurious. I learned that sometimes less is more. When I built The Westerman, I wanted to make sure it was easy to sail and maintain.
The designer, Nigel Irens, drew the boat on a napkin and then used a computer to make adjustments. The final result is a beautiful boat that has sailed across the Atlantic and won several racing competitions. It's a timeless design that doesn't follow current trends, but it's perfect for me.
I'm happy with my boat because it's built with natural materials and is waterproof. It's not like a modern glass fibre boat, but it feels like the real thing. I think it's a great example of how old and new ideas can come together to create something special.'

'NATURAL TALENTS
We humans are very similar to chimpanzees, our closest relatives. In fact, we are almost identical genetically. This means that any differences between us and animals are very recent. Our physical abilities, such as making art, must have developed quickly. But this is a big challenge for our genes.
Studies of animal behavior have shown that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use tools, and monkeys have a simple language. These discoveries leave us with few differences between humans and animals.
One difference that remains is art. But if human art is unique, it's strange that our ancestors didn't create art for millions of years. The earliest known human art is from around 35,000 years ago.
There are three main differences between human art and animal activities. First, human art is not useful for survival. Second, it's not just for aesthetic pleasure, but also to communicate with others. Third, it's learned, not inherited.
However, some animal art, like bird songs, also seems to be for aesthetic pleasure. And some animals, like chimpanzees, can create art for their own satisfaction.
In conclusion, the differences between human art and animal activities are not as clear-cut as we thought. While human art may be unique in some ways, it's not entirely different from animal art.'

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very difficult place to explore. It's also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are not many big adventures like this left. Charles's adventure was leading a team across the desert. He told me about his experience at his home.
Charles's team was made up of four British people, one American photographer, four Chinese people who knew the area, 30 camels, and six people who took care of the camels. It turned out that the people who took care of the camels had never worked with camels before. This could have been very dangerous.
They set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles had just left the army after 14 years and wanted to do something new. He wanted to prove to himself that he could do it. His wife was worried that he might not come back because nobody had done this route before.
It took them 59 days to cross the desert. They had to deal with many problems like dysentery, extreme heat and cold, and not having enough water. But they were lucky and found some water when they needed it.
Charles says that what kept him going was the need to survive. They didn't have a plan in case something went wrong. They were completely on their own in the desert.
Charles was very scared at the beginning of the trip, but as they walked, he became more confident. By the end, they were very tired but still strong. He says that he's proud of what they achieved, but he also knows that his family is more important to him.
Charles still likes the feeling of adventure and the sense of purpose it gives him. He finds it hard to be part of modern life now."

What does it mean to be eccentric? An eccentric is someone who does not follow the usual rules or norms of their society. But what is normal, anyway? We all have our own quirks and habits that might seem strange to others. Being eccentric is about being ourselves, even if that means being different.
Many of us have a mix of two feelings inside us: the desire to be like everyone else and the desire to be unique. This can be a struggle. We might want to fit in with others, but we also want to express ourselves and be different. This is a common feeling, and many people have it.
When we find others who share our unusual interests or hobbies, it can be comforting. We can talk to them and share our passions without worrying about what others think. This is why people who are different often join groups or clubs where they can be themselves.
We all have a balance between being individual and fitting in. Sometimes we might feel like we're just going along with the crowd, but deep down, we might resent it. We might want to stand out and be noticed. We can do this by being ourselves and expressing our individuality.
Some people have become successful by being true to themselves and not caring what others think. Bob Dylan, a famous musician, is an example of this. He followed his own path and didn't compromise.
Being eccentric is not just about doing something unusual for attention. It's about being natural and genuine. True eccentrics don't try to be different; they just are. They don't care what others think, and they do what they want because it's who they are. This is what makes them unique and special."

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five big book publishers in the UK about the effect of book reviews on their sales. Here's what they said.
Publisher A: Reviews are very important for us. Many people choose a book because of a good review. Authors and publishers both want good reviews, but publishers are more interested in the number of words written about the book, not just if it's good or bad.
Publisher B: Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to sell books. Book reviews are better now than they used to be, but there's still a problem: many reviews focus on big, expensive books and ignore smaller, cheaper ones.
Publisher C: Reviews are essential for us. Without them, we wouldn't know if people like our books. When reviews are good, they can help sell books a lot. Publishers look for big reviews, not just good ones, because they think it shows the book is important.
Publisher D: The relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK is complicated. In the US, a single good review in a big newspaper can make or break a book. Here, it's harder to know if reviews make a difference. Some books that get bad reviews sell well, while others that get great reviews don't sell at all.
Publisher E: Everyone wants great reviews, but do they really sell books? I once published a biography that got amazing reviews, but it didn't sell well. People thought they didn't need to buy the book because they had read the reviews. Does the name of the reviewer matter? In the past, if famous reviewers liked a book, people would buy it. Now, it's more about the reviewer's style and what they say.

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, had a big success with his first novel, The Horse Whisperer. The book was already popular before it was even published. Evans talks about how he came up with the idea and how he wrote the book.
At the beginning of the year, Evans was not doing well. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about his finances. He had not earned any money in two years, and the bank was getting impatient. Instead of getting a job, Evans decided to take a risk and go to America for three months to research his first novel. He had heard a story about a horse whisperer, a person who could calm down a wild horse just by talking to it. Evans was fascinated by this story and wanted to write a book about it.
Evans spent the spring traveling across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He was alone and feeling a bit down, but he was also excited to be working on his book. He wrote the first half of the book and then showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought the book was good and said Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. This was more than Evans needed to pay off his debts and keep going.
Evans sent his book to several publishers, and within a week, he got an offer of $75,000. This was a big surprise, and soon the book was sold to two major publishers for a record-breaking amount of money. The film industry was also interested in the book, and Evans got offers to make a movie out of it. He decided not to write the screenplay himself, but to stay involved as a consultant. The success of his book gave him the chance to write another novel, and he is now considering this option."

Bobby Fischer, a famous chess player, is back to play chess again. He's 49 years old, and it's been 20 years since he last played. His first game was good, but he's not as good as he used to be. His opponent, Boris Spassky, is also old. The game of chess has changed a lot since Fischer's time. Now, chess is a young person's game. Most top players are under 30 years old.
The game has become more professional, and players need to be in good shape and have strong nerves. They have to play for long periods without breaks, and the pressure is very high. Computers have also changed the game. Players can use them to study their opponents' games and prepare for matches.
Fischer's match with Spassky will be very tough. He's out of practice, and the game has changed a lot since he last played. If he wins, he'll get a lot of money, but if he loses, it could be very difficult for him. Fischer's return to chess is a big story, and people are curious to see how he'll do.

Volunteer tourism: a double-edged sword?
A. When people travel to help others, they often pay a fee to do so. This means that if they gave their money directly to the community, it could help more people than they could help themselves. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who don't need special skills or experience. Some people question whether these volunteers are really helping others or just trying to look good for their future careers.
B. Volunteer tourism can bring people together from different countries, help solve conflicts, and make the world a more democratic place. It can also help people learn new skills and make friends. However, if only rich people from wealthy countries get to volunteer, it might not help those who need it most.
C. International volunteering can be a good thing if it's done the right way. It can help people learn new skills, make a difference, and understand different cultures. But it can also be a way for rich people to feel good about themselves while ignoring the real problems that need to be solved. The best volunteering is when people work together to make a real difference.
D. Many people like the idea of volunteering because it seems like a simple way to help others. But sometimes, volunteering is used to avoid talking about the bigger problems that need to be solved. It's important to remember that volunteering should be a way to make a real difference, not just a way to feel good about ourselves.

""Choosing a Good Clock Radio
Many people listen to the radio in the morning. But how do you pick a good one? Our team, including the inventor Tom Granger and the broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different clock radios. We looked at their features and how easy they were to use.
One clock radio had a special function called a 'dual alarm'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. But this feature didn't work as we expected. The instruction book said to use it to set two different times, but most people don't plan their days that far ahead.
The radio we liked the most was the one with a cassette player. You can fall asleep listening to your favorite music and wake up to a quiet day without the news. The radio quality was excellent, but the clock was a bit big.
We also tested a clock radio with a digital display. It was easy to see the time and the snooze button was big and easy to press. But the buttons were so smooth and nice to touch that we couldn't help but play with them. This made it hard to set the clock.
Another clock radio had a special light that you can turn on to read the time. But it was hard to position and didn't shine very brightly. The buzzer was loud and woke us up easily.
The cheapest clock radio we tested was also the simplest. It had old-fashioned dial tuning, which was easy to use. The radio quality was good and the buzzer worked well.
We all agreed that the best clock radio was the one with the cassette player. It was easy to use and had good radio quality. But we also liked the simple, cheap clock radio because it was easy to set up and had good radio quality too."""

""Hedgehogs are small mammals with sharp spines on their bodies. They can be found in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can curl up into a ball when they feel threatened, and their spines stick out. This helps protect them from predators. The more spines a hedgehog has, the better it is at defending itself. Some desert hedgehogs are lighter and have fewer spines, so they try to run away first and roll into a ball as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding in bushes or holes. Some hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all of them do. In good conditions, some stay awake all year round.""

Jill, a 27-year-old skier, says it's a great feeling to fly down the mountain, but it can be scary too. She trains for 10 months a year and has to give up some of her social life. There are only three women in the British skiing team, but they all compete together and get treated the same.
Caroline, a 22-year-old cyclist, started cycling two years ago and won a charity race. She now earns a good income and gets sponsorship deals. But she worries that people might think she's only successful because she's pretty, not because she's a good cyclist. She trains for four hours a day and does other exercises to stay fit.
Annabel, a 26-year-old rower, says it's hard for girls to get into rowing because not many schools offer it. She loves being fit and has a good social life, but it's not easy. The women's rowing team has a lot of problems, but she enjoys it.
Ffyona, a 24-year-old long-distance walker, has walked around the world and set a record. She used to be very independent and didn't like people telling her what to do. She had to push herself really hard to complete her walks and had to deal with pain and blisters.
Lisa, a 26-year-old saloon car racer, says some men can be very competitive and aggressive when they're driving. She has to be competitive and aggressive too, but it's hard to earn money and she has to put it back into the sport. There are more women taking up racing now, which is great.
Alison, a 28-year-old triathlete, trains hard and has to get up early to swim and cycle. She loves being fit and socializing with other athletes, but it can be tiring. She sometimes asks herself why she does it, but the answer is that she's happier when she's fit and it's social.

I remember the day I met Picasso when I was 18 years old. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco in a old van. I had run out of money, so I got a job painting boats in Cannes harbour. I loved to draw and always carried a sketchbook with me. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant. I was surprised because he was known to be a private person who spent most of his time working alone. I was with a friend, and he encouraged me to go and ask Picasso for his signature. I was nervous, but Picasso was kind and agreed to sign my sketchbook. He even drew a beautiful design on the page.
After that, my friend suggested that I ask Picasso if I could draw his portrait. I was hesitant, but Picasso agreed. He acted out different expressions, making it hard for me to draw him. He would roll his eyes, stick out his tongue, and make funny shapes with his hands. I was tempted to give up, but Picasso seemed to be testing my determination. When he finally relaxed, I was able to draw him without interruptions. I was amazed by his youthful appearance, even though he was 84 years old. He had a strong and alert face, with piercing eyes that didn't blink until he looked away.
When I showed Picasso my drawing, he was kind and said it was good. Then, he asked to see my drawing of him, and I was embarrassed because I didn't think it was good enough. But Picasso liked it and even drew a portrait of me. He moved one eye onto my nose and summarized my smile in a single line. I looked like a character from one of his mythological paintings. I was grateful for the experience and thanked Picasso for his kindness.

**How Shops Make You Spend More Money**
Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more things than you planned? Shops use different tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:
**A. Fresh and Clean**
Shops know that people like to buy fresh food. So, they put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance of the store. They also have a bakery that smells like freshly baked bread. This makes people feel like they are buying healthy and fresh food.
**B. Where You See It, You Buy It**
Shops put the products they want to sell the most in the places where people look the most. They use computers to see where people buy the most and put the products there. They also put the most expensive products in these places.
**C. Make You Walk Around**
Shops put the cheap products, like bread and sugar, in different parts of the store. This makes people walk past the more expensive products on the way to the cheap ones.
**D. Less Is More**
Some shops make their products look exclusive by not putting too many things on the shelves. This makes people think that the products are special and worth buying.
**E. The Total Price**
Shops know that people are more interested in the total price of their shopping than the price of each item. So, they put a mix of cheap and expensive products in the store.
**F. The Price Tag**
Shops pay attention to the price tags of their products. They want to make sure that the prices are just right to make people buy the products.
**G. Lighting**
Shops use lighting to make their products look good. They want to show people what the products really look like in natural light.
**H. The Pathway**
Shops divide their stores into different areas with different carpets. This makes people walk along the path and look at the products on the way.
**I. In-Store Promotion**
Shops use big pictures and videos to promote their products. They want to make people want to buy the products.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. But in the late 20th century, we were in danger of losing our apple heritage. 
In the past, people ate apples as far back as 8,000 BC. They took apple seeds to Britain and left them around their homes. In Switzerland and Italy, people even dried apple halves for winter. 
The Romans taught the French how to grow fruit, and they took this knowledge to Britain. They introduced the dessert apple, Decio, which was liked by the British. 
In the Middle Ages, several types of apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a favorite until the 18th century. The Costard was another popular apple, sold in markets in Oxford. 
However, the country had some difficult times, and fewer apples were grown. People started to import apples from other countries. This continued until the 16th century, when Henry VIII ordered someone to visit France to learn about apple cultivation. 
In the 17th century, apples became very popular in Britain. The first settlers who went to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. 
In North America, John Chapman, also known as Johnny Appleseed, planted many apple trees. He was a kind person who loved animals and plants. 
In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer in Iowa discovered a new type of apple, which he called 'Hawkey'. It was very popular and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world. 
Another famous apple was discovered by Maria Anne Smith in Australia. She was a kind and independent woman who worked as a midwife. She found a small tree growing in a pile of discarded fruit and transplanted it. 
Now, apples are grown all over the world, but most are from just a few varieties. This is a problem because it means we are losing the diversity of apples. We need to make sure we protect the diversity of apples and other foods for the future."

Richard Nerurkar, a British long-distance runner, visited the Kenyan high-altitude training camp. The camp is located near Mount Kenya, the second-highest mountain in Africa. Richard had been going to this camp for three years, but this was the first time he trained with Kenyan runners. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in a 10,000-meter race.
Training at high altitude helps runners make more red blood cells, which helps them breathe better. Many Kenyan runners have been successful because of this. Richard's first race in Africa was also a special event. It was the first international cross-country race held in Africa. Richard finished 38th out of 41 runners, and all but three of the runners who finished ahead of him were Kenyan.
Richard believes that Kenyan runners' success is not just because of the altitude. They also have a simple way of running and a love for competing. He stayed with the Kenyan runners at their training camp, which is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. The camp is basic, with shared dormitories and simple food. The athletes have three workouts a day: a morning run, interval training in the morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. They also have a lot of free time.
The daily routine starts at 6:00 am. They have a simple breakfast, and then go for their morning run. The day's total distance is about 40 kilometers, which is almost a marathon. On Sundays, they have only one run of 20 kilometers. After their runs, they wash their faces and brush their teeth, and then have a simple lunch. In the evening, they go for a swim in a nearby stream.
When Richard left the camp, he realized that Kenyan success is not just because of genetics, upbringing, or altitude. He thinks that the simple lifestyle, hard workouts, and passion for success are the real reasons behind Kenya's success in distance running."

Advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic recession. The problem is that advertising has not kept up with the changing economy. Advertisers think in terms of big groups of people and big media channels, but as more brands and media have appeared, target groups have become smaller. This is the main reason advertising has gone wrong.
Think about your own shopping habits. You might buy 30-50 items at a supermarket, but most of these will not be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. In a year, you probably won't buy more than 400 different brands.
There are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised, but most people don't buy more than 400 of them. In fact, most people only buy a few dozen. When you watch TV, you might notice that only about 6% of the commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. The other 94% are probably wasted.
You might think you're special and not affected by advertising, but everyone thinks that. The truth is that most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Advertising is not very effective because people only pay attention to a small number of ads and ignore the rest.
Advertising can still be effective, but it needs to be more targeted to reach the right people. It's like trying to reach a small group of people in a big crowd. You can't know exactly who will respond to your message, but you can try to reach as many as possible.

'Charles Clover visits a special house in Nottinghamshire, England. This house is very environmentally friendly. The first surprising thing is the ancient Southwell Minster, a beautiful old cathedral. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house' designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and recycle their sewage to make compost for their garden. They even heat their house with the heat from their appliances and their own body heat.
The house looks like a traditional one with clay tiles and brick, but it's very modern inside. It's super-insulated, so it's very quiet and peaceful. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, wanted to show that it's possible to build a house that doesn't harm the environment. They designed it to emit no carbon dioxide and to use no mains water. They even have composting toilets and collect rainwater in the cellar.
The Vales don't have a dishwasher because they don't like the chemicals used in detergents. They want to show that it's possible to live in a house without harming the environment. They don't pay water bills and their electricity bill is very low. They will soon have solar panels to generate electricity and even charge their car.
The house is warm in the winter because it's well-insulated and has a small wood-burning stove. Robert says it's comfortable because there are no draughts and everything is at the same temperature. He thinks people should go back to living like they did before 1900, when houses were better insulated. The house is low-tech and easy to maintain, which makes it cheap to build. Unfortunately, the big building companies don't like this idea.'"

Blacksmiths have always been important people. They make things from iron, and people have always been fascinated by iron. In the past, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and scientists. They made important things like weapons, armor, and farming tools. Some blacksmiths even created beautiful ironwork for famous buildings like St Paul's Cathedral.
However, by the 1960s, blacksmiths were no longer needed because machines took over their jobs. Many people stopped using iron in their work. But recently, there has been a new interest in iron and blacksmithing. This is because people are now looking for more unique and decorative designs.
The British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is promoting the craft of blacksmithing. They are having an exhibition at the Fire & Iron gallery in Surrey, where you can see many beautiful pieces made by blacksmiths. These pieces range from small items like bookends to large items like spiral staircases.
The blacksmiths are using new tools that make it easier for them to shape and bend the metal. They can create many different designs and shapes. Some blacksmiths are even inspired by the way iron feels when it's hot and soft, and how it becomes hard and rigid when it cools down.
Iron is a special metal that has been used for a long time and will probably continue to be used for many years to come. It's a great material for making decorative items because it can be shaped and molded in many ways."

I thought giving up smoking would make everyone happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""Why didn't you stop years ago?"" she asked. I didn't know how to explain how I had suddenly stopped smoking after being a heavy smoker for so long. 
I went to a stop-smoking session because I was writing an article about people trying to quit. I said I wasn't going to try to stop, as it wouldn't be fair to expect the method to work on me. I enjoyed smoking and thought it was a pleasure. The counsellor looked at me strangely. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was filled with smoke. But when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to - and neither did the others. 
I think what happened was that the idea of stopping smoking made sense. Just like smoking had become a challenge, not being a smoker became attractive. It made me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling, just between me and myself. 
Quitting was easy. The physical cravings went away after a few days. The only thing that was difficult was doing nothing on weekends. I used to smoke to fill my time. Yes, I miss my cigarettes a bit, but not too much. Now, I have to think about what to do in situations where I used to smoke, like eating out or waiting for a plane."

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel prize. She is not well-known in her own country, which is surprising. I have been asking my friends about her, and most of them don't know who she is. They should know about her because she is the only British woman to have won a Nobel prize in science.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a remarkable person who studied crystals. Her life was affected by big changes in the 20th century, such as the increase in women's education and the globalization of science. When I started researching her life, I found that there were few books about her. This surprised me, as there are many books about other famous scientists.
Some people think that scientific biographies are boring. They believe that scientists don't lead interesting lives. However, this is not true. Scientists, like artists and writers, have interesting stories to tell. Unfortunately, many scientists are not comfortable talking about themselves or being photographed. This makes it hard for people to understand what scientists do.
Recently, some scientists have started to appear in the media more often. This has helped people see them as ordinary people, not just experts in their field. There are also more books about scientists that show their personal sides, like their families and hobbies.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a dedicated scientist who worked hard to solve important scientific problems. She was married and had three children, but her work was her passion. Her life is interesting because she was able to balance her work and personal life. Scientists like her are an important part of our heritage, but many people don't know about them."

He was lucky to have a good teacher, Bo Nilsson, who was a trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. Bo helped Hakan develop his talent and introduced him to other great trumpet players.
Hakan has always wanted to be a solo artist, not a member of an orchestra. He was inspired by the French trumpet player Maurice Andre and bought all his records. He practiced a lot and went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Hakan's teacher told him that playing in an orchestra is like digging in a garden - it's not very exciting. Hakan realized he had a special gift for communicating with his audience. He entered a competition and won, but he didn't win first prize. He was happy because people enjoyed his performance.
Hakan thinks that music is powerful because it can move people. He doesn't try to explain how he does it, because he thinks that would ruin the magic."

**Getting Ahead at Work: How to Be a Good Leader**
What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires others, helps them change and grow, and shows them the way forward. It's not about being tall or smart. According to Pat Dixon, a leadership expert, a good leader is someone who can make things happen with people who are as enthusiastic and interested as they are.
To be a good leader, you need to be able to speak clearly and confidently. You should be able to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"". You also need to have confidence in yourself and your ideas.
John van Maurik, a leadership expert, says that most people have the potential to be leaders, but they need to recognize and develop their skills. We are all born with the ability to lead, but we need the right circumstances to do so.
When thinking about leadership, we often think of famous leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson. But leadership is not just about grand gestures; it's also about how we lead in our daily work.
What makes a good boss? A good boss motivates and supports their team, and helps them achieve their goals. A bad boss, on the other hand, makes people feel unimportant and keeps information from them.
Leaders and managers are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path. A good leader can transform a struggling team or organization.
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
* Find your passions and convictions and use them to lead.
* Think of yourself as a leader and recognize your abilities.
* Sometimes, you need to take charge and make decisions. Experiment with different leadership styles.
* Set goals and work towards them.
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but don't feel like you need to lead all the time.
Remember, leadership is not just about being in charge; it's about making a positive impact on those around you."

I'm 34 years old and I've left my job to go backpacking. I'm a bit nervous because I've never done it before. I used to travel when I was younger, but I got a job, got married, and had a flat. But I realized that I was sacrificing my own happiness for my salary. So, I quit my job and decided to travel again.
Many of my friends are married with kids and they're a bit jealous of my freedom. I'm not in a relationship and I don't have big career goals, so I feel like I should make the most of this time. But I'm also worried about making the necessary arrangements, like finding someone to rent my flat and organizing my trip.
I'm also worried about adjusting to a more basic way of life and feeling out of place among younger backpackers. But many people in their 30s are taking a break from their normal lives to travel and explore. They're doing it for different reasons, such as to have a final adventure before settling down or to reassess their lives.
Some people think that we're just running away from our responsibilities, but I think it's a sign of a more stable and educated society that we're taking the time to think about what we want and what makes us happy. I'm excited to take this journey and see what the future holds.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a B1 learner:
I took a long break from my job as a journalist and felt out of touch with the latest technology. I was 37 and realized I needed to get back to work if I wanted to revive my career. I looked at my CV and saw that I was stuck in the 1980s, when computers were just starting to become popular. I didn't know how to use a computer and didn't have experience with desktop publishing. I thought I had no chance of getting a job.
But then I won a competition and got a new computer and internet connection for my family. My husband was free to work from home, and I set up a small office in the kitchen. I was nervous at first, but I learned quickly and soon I was chatting with people all over the world. My children were already familiar with computers from school, and they helped me learn.
I started working from home and was able to take care of my children at the same time. I was more organized and could keep track of my work and expenses easily. I could also research stories and connect with other journalists online.
Working from home has its advantages, but it can also be lonely and distracting. Sometimes I have to deal with power struggles with my children over who gets to use the computer. But many people are now working from home, and it's becoming more common.
According to a report, most people who work from home are well-educated and own a computer. I'm ahead of schedule, and who knows, maybe one day I'll be publishing my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless in this new world of technology.

""The future of newspapers is uncertain. Some people think that newspapers will stop being printed and only be online. But this change is not happening quickly. In fact, many newspapers are still selling well. The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian, for example, are still popular. Their websites are also very popular, but this doesn't mean that people are giving up their print copies.
In fact, some newspapers are actually growing in popularity. In Asia, newspaper sales are increasing. News and current affairs magazines are also doing well, with a 5.4% increase in sales. Books are also selling well, with e-readers like Kindle being popular. But people are still buying physical books too.
Some people think that young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but this is not true. Many young people still read the main national dailies. In different countries, the situation is different. In Britain, newspaper sales are declining, but in Germany and France, the decline is much slower.
Newspaper companies are trying to adapt to the changing world. Some are putting up paywalls on their websites, but this is not working well. The best way to make money is to offer a joint package of print and digital subscriptions. Print is still an important way to sell internet subscriptions. Print advertising also brings in much more money than online advertising.
However, it is difficult and expensive for newspapers to maintain both a website and a print edition. Newspaper brands are still well-known through print, but it is harder to get noticed online."""

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. They can make a picture more engaging than a scene without people. However, photographing people can be challenging. The photographer needs to consider not only technical and artistic aspects but also the person's actions, gestures, and expressions.
**Group Shots**
When taking a group photo, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also ask some to sit or kneel in front to make it easier to see everyone's faces.
**Posing for Pictures**
People often stiffen up when being photographed. To relax them, suggest they find a comfortable position. You can also ask them to fold their arms or put their hands in their pockets.
**The Right Approach**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can make people feel uneasy. Most people will agree to be photographed and are usually flattered. However, they may become self-conscious, so you may need to direct them.
**Eye Contact**
A picture is more effective if the subject looks directly at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, not just smile. You can remind them to do this just before taking the photo.
**Candid Concentration**
An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can make the viewer feel like they're observing the subject unnoticed.
**Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures can tell us more about the subject than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiles, winks, or tears to add interest to your photos.
**Situation Interest**
Including the subject's background or environment can add interest and information to the photo. Try to exclude irrelevant details or blur them to make the subject stand out.
**Interaction**
Photos of people interacting with each other, like couples, families, or friends, can be interesting. Look for eye contact, physical contact, or reactions to each other.
**People and Places**
When taking photos of people in a new place, try to show them against a relevant background. Use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to get the whole scene in the frame.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you're taking the photo. If you want a clear picture, ask the subject to pose. But if you're taking a candid shot, let them be themselves. Candid photos can be more memorable and enjoyable.

'Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success
The way we work is changing. We're not just judged on how smart we are or how well we were trained, but also on how well we get along with others. This is becoming important when choosing who to hire or promote. It's not just about being clever, but about having good social skills and being able to work well with others.
These skills are important because they help us be more marketable in the future. They're not about being good at exams, but about being able to work with people. We all have enough intelligence and technical skills to do our jobs, but we need to be able to work well with others.
In the past, we talked about things like character and personality, but now we have a new name for these skills: emotional intelligence. It's about being able to understand and control our own feelings and those of others. It's not just about being nice, but about being able to manage our feelings so we can work together effectively.
Many companies are now recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence in their employees. It's especially important in jobs that are complex and require teamwork. In the future, having good emotional intelligence will be essential for success in every job and in every part of the world.

Acupuncture is an old Chinese treatment that is over 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, exercise, and other techniques. Acupuncture is used to treat many different health problems, but doctors in the West are most interested in its ability to relieve pain.
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. It says that energy, or ""Qi,"" flows through the body along special paths called meridians. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, the body can become unbalanced and people may feel sick or weak. An acupuncturist tries to find where the Qi is blocked and then uses special needles to help the energy flow again.
There are over 300 points on the body where acupuncturists can insert the needles. These points are related to the meridians and are not always near the part of the body that is painful. People often feel a gentle tingling sensation when the needle is inserted, which is a sign that the needle has reached the Qi.
Doctors in the West have studied acupuncture and found that it can be effective for relieving pain. They have also found that it may work by blocking pain signals to the brain or releasing natural pain-relieving substances in the body.
Acupuncture can be used to treat many types of pain, including back pain, arthritis, and headaches. Some people use acupuncture as a last resort when other treatments have not worked. In China, acupuncture is even used during surgery to help patients feel less pain.
While some doctors and acupuncturists use acupuncture, others do not believe in the traditional Chinese theory of Qi and energy. They think that acupuncture may work because of the way the needles stimulate the nerves and release chemicals in the body. It is important to choose an acupuncturist who is qualified and who will work with your doctor if needed.

The study of handwriting can tell us a lot about a person's character. In some countries, employers ask for handwriting samples when hiring new employees. The handwriting can help them decide if the person is suitable for the job. Graphology, the study of handwriting, is considered a real science in many countries. Researchers say it can be useful in detecting certain illnesses, like heart disease or cancer, and revealing psychological states.
Many big companies use graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential employees. But most doctors and psychiatrists are not convinced about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can show us a person's intelligence, social class, and even their mental ability.
According to Ms. Marne, graphology can also be used to assess a person's potential, whether they are honest or not, and whether they have a good or bad character. She claims that handwriting can even predict whether someone might commit a crime or try to harm themselves.
Handwriting can also show signs of physical health problems, such as heart or lung issues. Ms. Marne says that it takes a lot of study and experience to become a good graphologist, and that more research is needed to prove the science behind graphology.
While some people think graphology is useful, others disagree. They say that handwriting is just a product of education and artistic ability, and has no special meaning."

Is your office a happy and healthy place to work? A new survey says that fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workforce.

Here are their opinions:
Office A: Advertising Agency
The consultant said this office is very simple, but the people who work here are happy. They have a small team and don't have to follow strict rules. The ergonomist said the chairs are old and not very good for your back, but the people here have a varied schedule, which helps them avoid getting tired or bored. The psychologist said the office is small and cozy, and people like it.
Office B: News Service
The consultant said this office is comfortable and well-maintained. There's no smoking allowed, which helps keep the air clean. The ergonomist said the chairs are good, but the office is a bit boring. The psychologist said most staff have been here for a long time and get along well, but the office could be improved by adding some decorations and displays.
Office C: Bank
The consultant said this office is a bit strange - it's like being in a museum! Despite having smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air is still fresh. The ergonomist said the desks are okay, but not great. The psychologist said staff are supportive and have good technology, but the office could be more lively.

Chewing gum is very popular in the United States. Americans chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. But where did this habit come from? Let's find out.
A long time ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a sticky substance from the bark of a special tree. They used it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Later, American colonists started chewing a similar substance from spruce trees. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the United States.
In the 1860s, a new type of gum was discovered. It came from the sap of a special tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more fun to chew than the old kind. Soon, many people started making gum from this new material.
But as the gum industry grew, it became harder to find the sap. So, people started making gum with synthetic materials instead. Today, most gum is made from these synthetic materials.
Some people still gather the sap from the trees, but it's very hard work. They have to climb the trees, cut the bark, and carry the sap back to their camp. It's a difficult and dangerous job. But they do it because they need the money.
Gum is not just fun to chew. It also helps keep our teeth healthy. When we eat, acid forms on our teeth. Our saliva helps to neutralize the acid and keep our teeth strong. Chewing gum can help increase our saliva flow, which can help keep our teeth healthy.
Gum manufacturers are always trying to come up with new flavors and textures. They use different ingredients, like glycerine and vegetable oils, to make the gum base. Some flavors are natural, while others are artificial. The United States even has a special area dedicated to growing the mint used in many popular gum flavors.

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She visits hotels to check if they meet the standards. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. The receptionist didn't even say hello to a guest who was waiting to be checked in. Sue thought this was a big mistake. She has been inspecting hotels for 11 years and knows what to expect.
The hotel had three stars, which means it is one of the best hotels in the country. But when Sue arrived, she didn't like what she saw. The door to the car park was unmanned and the corridor to the hotel was long and dark. She thought this wasn't good.
When she got to the reception, the receptionist told her that they didn't have her booking. It turned out that 12 of the hotel's 15 rooms were empty. Sue didn't like the room she was shown because it was stuffy and had a big hole in the wall.
The next morning, Sue told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, about all the things that were wrong. He apologized for the smell in the lounge and said they would fix it. Sue also suggested that the staff should be more careful when showing guests to their rooms.
Despite all the problems, Sue found some good things about the hotel. The assistant manager and a young waitress were very helpful, and the food was good. Sue told Greaves that the hotel didn't need to lose its three stars, but they needed to fix some things to keep it. She also told him that another inspector would be coming back soon to make sure everything was fixed.
Greaves was relieved that Sue didn't take away the hotel's stars, but he was also worried about what the next inspector would find."

I, Doug Scott, am a mountaineer who climbed the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. I will tell you about my experiences.
A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)
I climbed Mt. Everest with my partner, Dougal Haston. We were in a snow cave near the summit when we talked about sleeping bags. I thought it was strange, but we were both feeling the effects of high altitude. We were worried about the quality of our survival, not just our lives. I realized I had to get a better rhythm to reach the summit.
B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)
Dougal and I climbed Mt. McKinley, also known as Denali. We followed a new route, carrying our equipment and food. We climbed up an avalanche scar and camped under a rocky cliff. The air pressure was low, making it feel like we were at a higher altitude. We were both tired and suffering, but we made it to the summit.
C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)
I climbed Kilimanjaro with Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the jungle, but found a trail of rubbish that led us to a rock pool. We took a different route to the summit, which was surreal.
D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu, and a guide, Phil Erscheler. We took a new route, avoiding the busy path. The wind was strong, but we made it to the summit.
E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
I guided a team to Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica. We had to pay to get there, but it was worth it. The air was clean and invigorating, and we reached the summit quickly.
F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)
I climbed Elbrus with a team. We took a cableway to a high point and then walked to the summit. The wind was strong, but we made it.
G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)
I climbed Carstensz Pyramid with a team. We wanted to establish a new route and meet the local Dani people. We were warned about bandits, but we were not deterred. We reached the summit and were given a standing ovation.

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants spread themselves around the garden, but she likes the way it looks. The garden has two long flower borders that are very colorful and well-organized. This is because the previous owners, who were good gardeners, left some plants behind, and Susan inherited a gardener named Danny. 
Susan likes to paint individual flowers, not the garden as a whole. She takes one flower at a time, paints it, and then brings another one in. Sometimes it takes a few years to finish a painting. Her busy time is in spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies are blooming. She likes the way they change shape and color over time.
Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and used to collect wild flowers. She didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. Now, she has plants from all over the world in her garden, and she likes them just as much. She lets her garden grow freely, like a happy aunt letting her children play. 
Susan has two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and she's been busy painting. She now has an extra gardener to help her, but she knows she needs to get her hands dirty to stay connected to her art."

Many trees were knocked down in the storms in March. The town's market square lost two big lime trees. This changed the look of the town centre, which made some people unhappy. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the police force, was one of those unhappy people. But at the time, he was too sick to notice. He had bronchitis and was in bed for a few days.
Pelham's wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he didn't listen. He thought the police force needed him and he couldn't take time off. This made him feel worse and his memory got foggy. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor's office. The doctor gave him medicine and told him to rest.
When Pelham felt a bit better, he asked his wife about the damage to their house. She told him that the walnut tree in their garden had been knocked down. He didn't think much about it at the time. It was only when he got out of bed on Saturday that he noticed how much the garden had changed. The tree used to hide the worn-out furniture in their living room. Without the tree, the room looked bright and the furniture looked old and worn out. The house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible and looked ugly.
Pelham didn't like the new view. He thought it was terrible. His wife, Molly, disagreed. She thought they needed to buy a new sofa to make the room look better."

We had been living in our valley for 16 months when we realized that the hills surrounding our home could pose a danger to our safety. The winter came early that year, and the snow started falling heavily. The snow blocked our lane and made the path slippery and dangerous. We were worried about the river, the Ryburn, which was normally calm. We remembered that if the snowmelt had not been controlled by dams, the river could have flooded our valley. The snow started to melt, and the river began to swell. We watched as the clouds gathered over the hills, warning us of an impending disaster. The river became wild and turbulent, and we were worried that it would overflow. For the first time in years, the reservoir overfilled and water poured into the stream. The river was furious, and the stream beneath our bridge was deeper and more turbulent than we had ever seen it. We prayed that the dam would hold, and fortunately, it did. The waters subsided, and we were relieved. Thanks to the dam, we can now enjoy the power of the river and feel safe in our valley.

I'm Mark Adams, a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. I've been doing this job for 10 years. Before this, I did some reviews for other newspapers, magazines, and radio. I met Tom Seaton, the arts editor, who also worked for radio and TV. He hired me, but he wasn't a journalist, so he might not have chosen the best people for the job.
At first, Tom's idea was to have a team of critics who could write about different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would meet for lunch every week to discuss what we would write about. But it didn't work out like that. We didn't get together as planned, and everything was done over the phone. People didn't like the idea of a critic writing about different things. So, I focused on film.
I like my job because I get to write about one film each week. I wouldn't want to write about every film that comes out. That would get boring. I get to make my own arguments and choose what I want to write about. I don't think I have to be right or wrong about a movie. I just need to give my opinion. I'm not a judge, and I don't want to be one.

Do you know why a 17-year-old girl would want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? It's because she loves it! She's looking for a training partner who likes long-distance running, swimming, and cycling. She wants someone who can do all three without stopping. The triathlon is a popular sport that people watch and participate in. But why do athletes do it? Melanie Sears, a 17-year-old triathlete, doesn't say it's for personal satisfaction or mental challenge. She just loves the feeling of finishing.
Melanie started triathlons at 14 and won the junior section. She was so confident that she entered the National Championships, but things didn't go as planned. She got lost during the cycle ride and ended up cycling 20km too far. She was disappointed, but she didn't give up. She wants to keep going and is determined not to stop.
Melanie's coach, Steve Trew, is impressed with her determination. He says she works hard and never gives up. Melanie was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships and finished 13th overall. She wants to improve her cycling skills and is trying to convince her parents to buy her a new bike so she can participate in longer races.
Melanie's training is intense, and she doesn't have much of a social life. She spends most of her free time training and talking to her teammates about their times and achievements. She wants to enter even tougher events and is looking for someone her age to train with.

I love collecting things and many people do too. One in three adults collect something. Collecting is a world of passion and excitement. But remember, only collect things you really love. People have been collecting things for a long time. Even ancient people collected stones and shells because they liked their shapes and colors. I have been collecting things all my life. I collect flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was of stones I found in my parents' garden.
I was lucky to go to a school in a remote place in England when I was six. My parents would take me to the local museum, which had many objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. Many people collect things, not just me. Some people collect because it's the only thing they can control. For me, it's just something I enjoy.
There are many famous collectors, like the Duc de Berry in France, who had a room full of strange and interesting things. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I have collected many different things, like tulip bulbs and china cups. I even collected 350 American rag dolls. Unfortunately, my house caught fire and my collection was destroyed. I was very sad.
What I find interesting is how collections change hands. A spoon that once belonged to a king or a famous poet can be very valuable. When certain objects become popular, their price goes up. The toys of the 1950s are now valuable if you still have the original boxes. (I threw mine away, along with the toys!)"

I organize temporary exhibitions at the science museum. I plan and design the exhibition and advertise it. I read about the subject and talk to experts to decide what to show and how to show it. I make sure visitors can understand the exhibition by planning interactive activities and workshops. I also work with engineers to make sure the exhibition is safe.
Janet - London Taxi Driver Teacher
I teach people how to drive a taxi in London. I check the accounts and prepare materials for students to learn the routes. In the morning, students practice finding the best routes. I help when they disagree about the best way to go. When they're almost ready for the test, I give them a new route and tell them why they can't take the original route because of road closures. This helps them think critically.
Sarah - Marine Conservationist
I work from home and respond to phone calls, create educational materials, and organize courses. Sometimes I go to our main office, but mostly I work by the sea. I also work with schools and study centers, teaching people who make decisions about the ocean. I take them on boat trips to show them the importance of marine life. I love my job because it's my hobby too. The only downside is that we need more money, so I have to find more resources.
Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
My job is varied. I make sure our books meet customer needs and keep track of our stock. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters about issues like boundary representations, which require careful answers. I discuss projects and sales with other publishers. I work with a friendly team, which makes my job enjoyable. The only downside is too much administration, which takes away from more interesting tasks like product development and design.""

We found out about the house from a friend, Strafe. He saw an advertisement and showed it to us. We didn't like our previous holiday because the food was bad. We've been friends with Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me (my name is Milly, but my friends call me Milly) for a long time. We all live near each other and are about the same age.
When we arrived, Mrs Malseed was waiting for us in the big hall. She always knows when we're coming. She showed us to our rooms, which were named after flowers. In the winter, she takes care of the little things, like painting flowers on the doors. Her husband, Mr Malseed, takes care of the repairs and decorations.
When we got to the hall, Mr Malseed greeted us with a big smile and said, ""A hundred thousand welcomes!"" He made us feel like we were more than just hotel guests. We all smiled and felt like our holiday had started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn Lodge, everything was fine.
After dinner, we played cards for a bit, but not for too long because we were still tired from our journey. There were other people in the lounge, including a man and a French couple. We could see some of them walking on the lawn or going down to the beach. The next day, we would walk along the beach to Ardbeag, have coffee, and come back for lunch. In the afternoon, we would go somewhere else. This is what we usually do because we love the beautiful landscape here.

Are you unhappy in your job but don't know what to do? Many people are in this situation. One good option is to see a careers adviser. They will ask you to write about yourself and then do some tests called 'psychometrics'. The results will show which careers might be good for you and what training you might need.
I went to Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The tests were like my science exams. I had to answer questions quickly with a group of people. It wasn't about passing or failing, just about understanding myself better. Then I talked to an adviser and they gave me a report with their ideas and suggestions. I agreed with most of it, but I was surprised to find out I didn't do well in the scientific and practical tests. 
It's not always necessary to change your job completely. Donna Laney, a 25-year-old, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts. She was surprised to find out she had a talent for design, but it was expensive to retrain. In the end, she used her existing skills to move to a job in public relations.

However, careers advice isn't always helpful. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, went to a careers adviser but didn't find it useful. She didn't like the ideas they suggested because they required a lot of retraining or a pay cut. She thought she could have gotten the same advice from a friend.

He says many people are scared of going to the dentist because they associate it with pain. So, he has created a friendly atmosphere to make you feel at ease.
Dr. Jerome doesn't wear a white coat, which is unusual for a dentist. He thinks it can make people feel nervous. Instead, he wants you to feel relaxed, interested, and even enjoy your visit. He uses special techniques to make you feel calm, like virtual reality headsets that let you watch a film while he examines your teeth.

He takes his job very seriously and uses the latest techniques to make sure you have a good experience. For example, he uses a special instrument that sprays warm water to clean your teeth, instead of scraping them.

Chocolate is a popular treat that comes from South America. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter, which is a lot of money. In fact, eight per cent of all chocolate is bought at Easter. Christmas is the only time when people eat more chocolate. 
Chocolate has been around for a long time. The Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans grew the cacao tree over 3,000 years ago. The fruit of the tree contains 20-40 seeds, which become cacao beans when dried. These beans are used to make chocolate. 
In the past, the Aztecs used cacao beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water'. They flavoured it with spices and drank it on special occasions. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar. 
In the 17th century, chocolate houses were popular in European cities, where people would gather to drink chocolate. Until the 19th century, chocolate was made from solid blocks that had to be melted in hot water. Then, a Dutch inventor created chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter. 
In 1847, a British company called Fry and Sons created the first chocolate bar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to the recipe, making milk chocolate. 
Today, British chocolate companies like Cadbury are popular, but some farmers who grow cacao beans are struggling because of a price crash in the 1980s. Maybe we should think about them the next time we eat a chocolate bar."

Gold mining used to be a big industry in Wales, but it has declined a lot since the 1880s. Now, some individuals are starting to search for gold again. George Hall, another prospector, is planning to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill. He says searching for gold is exciting and emotional. He hopes to find some gold this time.

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves to spend time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater adventures in a special vehicle that's like a small car. She dives down to the ocean floor to study underwater volcanoes.
The space inside the vehicle is very small, so she can touch the two pilots who are with her. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. The dive can take 16 hours - three hours to get down, 10 hours to collect samples, and three hours to get back up.
If something goes wrong, she can press a panic button. The outside part of the vehicle will break off and float to the surface quickly. Rachel has gone on six dives so far. Last year, she went on a trip with a Russian team to a place with many underwater volcanoes. They were studying how the ocean floor changes.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the university. She teaches to earn money so she can continue her research on underwater volcanoes. She loves her job and finds it exciting to explore the deep ocean.
Rachel has been studying underwater volcanoes for three years. When she finally saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling. She felt a sense of wonder and excitement being at the bottom of the sea, knowing that no one else had ever seen these things before.

I was tired, hungry, and dirty after my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired from all the traveling, and my mind was overwhelmed by all the new languages, timetables, and currencies. I said, ""I'll never do this again."" But I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. The good thing about Inter-Rail was that I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month with just one ticket. This way of traveling is special because it lets young people see many countries in a short time. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how much we could travel. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in France. But then we started to explore and discovered that we could travel to many other countries without extra cost. We were not very interested in culture, but we liked the freedom to organize our own trips. We were excited to see new places and do things our own way. When we arrived in a new city, it was like discovering a new world. Seeing Europe with my own eyes was a great experience. It's one thing to know about a place, but it's different when you see it for yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos are boring - they don't show the real experience. The train trip was a valuable experience for me, and it helped me understand how big and diverse Europe is."

Losing your luggage at the airport can be very frustrating. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline finds your bag. This can be especially bad if you're in a different climate or far from home. Airlines don't usually say how many bags they lose, but it's a common problem. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes.
The airline's baggage system has a few flaws. They have to check you in early so that your bag can get to the plane on time. They also have to allow some extra time for your bag to get from one plane to another. But sometimes flights are delayed because of security checks or air traffic. This can cause problems with your bag.
Human error or accidents can also happen. For example, the label might get torn off. This can happen more often at big airports where many bags are being handled. Even good airports like Amsterdam or Singapore can have problems sometimes.
To avoid losing your luggage, try to take a direct flight and check in early. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline. Give yourself extra time by taking an earlier flight and make sure your bag is clearly labeled with your home and holiday addresses, and the flight numbers. If your bag still goes missing, go to the baggage hall and fill out a report before leaving the airport.

Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who loves kingfishers. These birds are blue-green and live near streams and rivers, eating fish. The kingfisher's home is a special place with old trees, soft greens, and browns. The sunlight creates many different yellows, making the scene look soft and peaceful. The bird flies quickly and quietly, like a laser beam, leaving a lasting impression. Charlie fell in love with kingfishers when he was young, but he can't explain exactly why. Kingfishers are famous in stories and myths. In Greek legend, a moon goddess turned into a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body turned blue and its lower body got hot from the sun. This is partly true. Kingfishers don't have blue feathers, but the way their feathers are structured makes them look blue. This is why the bird can change from bright blue to green depending on the light. Kingfishers are popular among wildlife photographers because they are beautiful and can be easily watched from a hiding spot. Charlie's first hiding spot was an old blanket, and he took his first good picture of a kingfisher after four years of trying. Kingfishers became his passion, and he spent all his free time near a stream with many kingfishers. However, he had to miss school, which affected his grades. Despite this, his love for kingfishers got noticed, and he started working as an advisor for a nature magazine. He now works as a freelance wildlife film cameraman and wants to make the perfect kingfisher film. He wants to show the beauty of the bird through pictures, without using words. Charlie is still fascinated by the kingfisher's colors and spends a lot of time thinking about them. His photos show how much he loves the bird, but there's more to his relationship with the kingfisher than just his work."

**Theme Parks in Britain**
If you're thinking of taking your children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to try out the best ones. Here are their experiences:
**Fun Island**
We went to Fun Island with our three-year-old child. We thought it might not be as exciting as a big theme park in the US, but we were surprised. The park has many rides for younger children, so our child didn't feel left out. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special ride for very young children that was a big hit. For older children, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! We only didn't like that the park didn't have much atmosphere and the scenery was not very nice. But the staff were very helpful and the park was clean and well-organized.
**Wonderland**
We went to Wonderland with our family, including a three-year-old. We didn't know what to expect, but our child loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, where there were small replicas of famous buildings at his level. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were glad there were places to rest. The park is nicely designed, and the staff are very helpful and friendly.
**Adventure World**
We spent seven hours at Adventure World and still had a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great trapeze act. They also enjoyed the Terror Line, although they were a bit scared. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is a lot of fun. The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great.
**The Great Park**
We visited The Great Park, but it only opened until 5 pm. This park is great for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. Even I, who is a scaredy-cat, had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes exciting. We waited in line for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over before we knew it! If you're brave, the Big Leap looks great, but I wouldn't go on it.
**Fantasy World**
Fantasy World has many rides, including Europe's tallest rollercoaster. Our child thought it was the most scary ride, but another child thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters high, was even scarier! There are many rides for older children, and some for younger ones too. We thought the staff were a bit mixed - some were great with young children, but not all were friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World."

**Running a business in the countryside**
Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside. They all chose to move out of the city to start their own businesses.
**Christine Hogan** has a computer-aided design business. She used to work in London, but moved to the countryside to be closer to her family. She started her business at home and now has four full-time employees. She likes being able to work from home and can even work in the evenings if she wants to.
**Maggy Sasanow** is a designer who makes greetings cards. She used to work in an art museum, but moved to the countryside after she got married. She started her own business and sells her cards to museums. She works from home, but sometimes finds it hard to switch off from work.
**Delia Turner** makes curtains. She started her business eight years ago and it was very successful. She had to lay off her employees when the economy declined, but is now back to working from home with the help of her husband and a few part-time workers.
**Tessa Strickland** runs a children's book publishing business. She moved to the countryside for financial reasons and to be closer to nature. She enjoys being able to work at her own pace and takes calls from all over the world.
**Meg Rivers** makes cakes and sells them online and in her shop. She started her business at home and now employs six people. She had to work hard to get her business off the ground, but is now very successful.
All of these women have chosen to start their own businesses in the countryside. They enjoy the freedom and flexibility that comes with working for themselves, and are proud of what they have achieved."

Meet the Amazing Watkins Family
The Watkins family is very special because they are all musicians. The father, John, makes instruments, and his sons, Paul and Huw, are composers and prize-winning musicians.
When Paul was 10, he needed a cello for his music lessons. His parents couldn't afford to buy one, so John decided to make one himself. He went to a school for instrument making and learned how to make cellos. Paul's first cello was made by his father, and he used it until recently.
John now makes violins full-time and sells them to famous musicians. Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul learned to play the piano first, but then he switched to the cello. Huw started with the piano too, but he didn't like it as much as the cello.
Both brothers were encouraged to play music by their parents. Paul won a big competition on the cello and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played his father's cello for a long time, but now he plays a new cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music.
Paul and Huw are both doing well in their music careers. Paul will be playing on TV soon, and Huw's string quartet will be performed at a concert in London. Their parents will have to work hard to keep track of all their sons' music activities.

The National Trust is a group that works to protect the British countryside. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and met Gareth Roberts, a warden who takes care of the beautiful areas owned by the Trust. To be a warden, you need to be sensible and good at dealing with people. Gareth was born and grew up in the area and worked on his parents' farm before becoming a warden. He applied for the job because he knew the area well and had experience working with farmers.
Gareth's farming background has been helpful in his job. He can understand the problems that farmers face and can work with them to find solutions. He also knows how to do physical tasks like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working for the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He used to collect flowers, butterflies, and birds' nests as a child, but now he realizes that farming has changed the countryside.
When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists were not getting along. They had different ideas about how to manage the land. But now, they are talking and working together. Gareth's job involves making sure projects are finished on time and on budget, as well as talking to the public and working with tenant farmers. He enjoys seeing projects finished and likes talking to most people. However, he sometimes finds it difficult to deal with people who don't respect the land and the work that the Trust does.
If you like the outdoors and are good with people, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. But be prepared to wait for a job to become available - it may take a while!"

Meet Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. She's very focused on getting ready for the World Championships next month. Before the big event, she teaches at a local school and then trains in a car park. She doesn't notice strange looks from people because she's too busy concentrating on her movements.
Kendra's whole life is about being at her best for the Championships. She has a strict schedule to get fit for the tournament. This is her fourth time playing in the World Championships, and it's going to be the biggest one yet with 27 countries taking part.
The team will have home support, which is great. Kendra wants to make sure netball is popular in England, so there will be more pressure than usual. The team will have to play well in the first game against Barbados, which is a tough opponent. England is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the tournament will be challenging.
In the 15 years she's been playing at the top level, netball has become faster and harder. Players are more aggressive, but once the game is over, they become friends again. The team is taking a more scientific approach to fitness testing, and Kendra thinks it's important to be a strong leader and support her teammates.
Kendra has always planned her netball career carefully. This will be her last big event as a player, but she might coach young players in the future. When she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye because it will be a special moment."

'MUSIC SCHOOLS FOR TALENTED CHILDREN
What to do if your child is very good at music? It's not always easy to help them develop their talent. Some parents might not notice their child's gift until they start behaving badly because they're not getting the help they need. Most schools are good at helping children who are good at other subjects, but music schools are special because they understand children who are very good at music.
There are five music schools in Britain that are perfect for children who are between 7 and 18 years old. These schools provide a special environment where children can learn and practice music with professional musicians. They spend most of their day doing music activities like playing instruments, singing, and practicing with a teacher. They also have some time for regular school subjects like English, maths, and science.
The schools are small and have a high number of teachers for each student. Most students live at the school, which means they are with other students who like music just like them. This can be a great way to make friends and learn together.
There are some disadvantages to these schools. They are expensive, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year. However, the schools try to help parents who can't afford the fees. Some parents might not want their children to live away from home at such a young age. The directors of the schools think it's better to wait until children are a bit older before sending them to a music school.
It's also important to consider the pressure of being a music student. Some children might feel stressed or unhappy if they're not doing well. The schools keep an eye on each student and offer help if needed. Some former students like the music schools, but others think it's too focused on music and not enough on other subjects. If your child is very good at music and also good at other subjects, they might do well at a normal school with a good music department or by taking music lessons outside of school.'

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. The garden has a special harmony of colors, shapes, and structures. This is because the previous owners were good gardeners and left some plants that Susan likes. She also inherited a gardener named Danny. Susan likes to focus on individual flowers rather than the whole garden. She takes the flowers to her studio, paints them, and then adds more flowers to the painting. Sometimes it takes a few days or even a few years to finish a painting.
Susan's favorite time of year is spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. She loves how the flowers change shape and color over time. She's always been interested in plants and used to collect wildflowers as a child. Now, she has a garden with plants from all over the world. Susan is relaxed about the garden and lets her children play there. She's been busy preparing for two upcoming exhibitions and hasn't had much time to work in the garden lately. But she knows that to stay inspired, she needs to get her hands dirty and take care of the garden herself.

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for a B1 learner:
Are you trying to get your writing published? Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many people write to us asking, ""Where can I send my story?"" First, you need to research the market and learn about publishers. You also need to improve your writing skills. To do this, you should read a lot of different types of writing. Visit your local library and bookstores to find out what kinds of writing publishers are looking for. Keep in mind that publishers' preferences change over time, so you need to stay up-to-date.
If you're not sure what kind of writing you want to do, start by reading different types of stories and magazines. For example, if you like writing love stories, find out which magazines publish them and read some recent issues. This will help you understand what kind of stories they like and who their readers are.
Don't send your writing to publishers too early. Most new writers make the same mistake. They send their work out too soon, before it's good enough. Instead, write more stories and improve them. Don't be discouraged if you get rejected. Every successful writer has been rejected many times. Keep writing and learning, and you will get better.
To improve your writing, you can take a creative writing course or join a local writers' group. This will help you meet other writers and get ideas and confidence. Remember, to be a good writer, you need to keep writing every day."

I was waiting for my train at Baltimore railway station on a cold winter day. There were many people waiting, more than I expected. The station was usually clean and quiet, but today it was noisy and crowded. I saw an old man walking around, talking to strangers. He was well-dressed and seemed important. He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to New York. He then asked an old lady, but she said she was going to Wilmington. I noticed him because he seemed stressed and was asking a lot of people if they were going to Philadelphia.
I was going to Philadelphia myself, but he didn't ask me. I thought maybe he didn't think I was reliable. He walked away and asked another woman if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes, and he asked her for a favor. He told her that his daughter was going to fly to Philadelphia and had forgotten her passport. He had already sent his daughter to the station and was now looking for someone to bring the passport to her. The woman was kind and said she would help.
I didn't think this story sounded right. Why didn't he go himself to get the passport? The woman asked him why he couldn't leave his wife alone, and he said she was in a wheelchair. I thought this was a weak excuse. I also noticed that he was holding a padded envelope, which seemed suspicious. I thought the woman should be careful.

Finding a flat in Dublin was very difficult. Jo had just moved to Dublin and didn't know anyone who could help her find a place to live. She had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat on her own. Jo's friends at school thought she was crazy for moving to Dublin, but she wanted to experience city life.
Jo's family thought it would be best if she stayed in the hostel, but she wanted to find a place of her own. She saw an ad for a flat in Ringsend that seemed too good to be true. It had its own room, TV, and shared kitchen and bathroom. Jo hoped it would be nice and not too expensive.
When Jo arrived at the flat, she met two girls, Nessa and Pauline. They were nice and invited her to stay for a cup of tea. They told Jo that another girl had visited the flat earlier and was very rude. Jo was surprised to learn that Pauline was a punk, something she had only seen from afar.

People love dolphins. They are smart, friendly, and seem to understand human emotions. We see them in movies and TV shows, but did you know that their situation is very serious? According to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, their numbers are decreasing rapidly.
Dolphins are found in the oceans all over the world. There are many different kinds, but some are more common than others. The striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the harbour porpoise are all found in European waters. Some dolphins live far out at sea, while others live near the coast.
Unfortunately, many dolphins are in danger. The number of harbour porpoises in the North Sea has decreased by up to 89,000. This is because of pollution and overfishing. Dolphins need to eat fish to survive, but if there are no fish, they will not survive. They can also get caught in fishing nets and die.
Another problem is that dolphins can eat poisonous substances that are in the water. These substances can build up in their bodies and be passed on to their babies through their milk. This has already happened to one young dolphin.
Finally, dolphins are also affected by noise pollution. They use sound to communicate with each other, but loud noises from ships and other machines can disturb them. We don't yet understand how this affects them, but it could be a big problem.
Overall, dolphins need our help. We need to take care of the oceans and protect these amazing creatures."

EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOU Exercise is very important for our bodies and minds. It helps us stay healthy and strong. There are many reasons why we should exercise. It makes our muscles stronger and helps us look better. It also helps us feel better and sleep better. Exercise can even help us feel less stressed and anxious.
Some people might think that exercise is boring, but it's actually very helpful. There are many different types of exercise we can do, such as running, yoga, and lifting weights. We should start slowly and carefully, especially if we're new to exercise. It's also a good idea to talk to a doctor before we start a new exercise routine.
Good posture is important too. If we stand or sit up straight, we look and feel better. We can practice good posture by imagining a balloon pulling our head up towards the sky. This helps us lift our chest and stretch our stomach, making us look slimmer.
Stretching is also important. It helps us move more easily and prevents injuries. We should stretch four or five times a week to stay flexible and strong. A good exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, a workout, and a cool-down. By following these steps, we can stay healthy and fit."

Amanda and Owen don't argue often, and they both have the same ideas about filming animals. They set up their tents at night and make tea the day before to take with them in the morning. They eat pre-cooked meals and sometimes have to worry about food when they are away for a long time.
The best part of their job is getting close to the animals and becoming part of their lives. Owen remembers a time when they filmed a family of lions, and one lioness would come to say hello to their car every day.
Amanda and Owen have worked together for many years, making films about different animals. They try to make their films feel real and emotional, so that people will care about the animals and the places they visit.

Meet England's Netball Captain
Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. She told Suzie about her daily routine before the World Championships. Kendra has a busy schedule, teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. Suzie was surprised by the training venue, but Kendra said she's too focused on her movements to notice anything else.
Kendra is very dedicated to her training. She wants to be at her best for the World Championships, which will be held next month. This will be her fourth time playing in the tournament, and it will be the biggest one yet with 27 countries taking part.
Kendra is excited to have the support of the home crowd. She thinks it will be a big advantage for the team. They will play against Barbados in their first game, and Kendra says they will be a tough opponent.
The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows it will be a tough competition. She said, ""You have to push yourself to play every day, and there's no rest between games. But even if you lose the first game, you can still win the tournament.""
Kendra has been playing netball for 15 years, and she says the sport has become faster and more competitive. She believes that you have to be mentally tough to be a good player. As captain, she tries to lead by example and support her teammates.
Kendra has always planned her netball career carefully. She decided a long time ago that this will be her last big competition as a player. After the World Championships, she might become a coach and help young players develop their skills. For now, she's focused on her last big event and will be emotional when she leads her team out onto the court."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves to spend time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research on the chemistry of the sea. She is a teacher at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater adventures in a special vehicle. It's like a small car, but for the ocean! She dives down three kilometers to study underwater volcanoes.
""It's very cramped inside,"" she says. ""I can touch the pilots, who are used to being in these conditions. We can't stand up or move around, so we have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can take 16 hours. We spend three hours going down, ten hours collecting samples, and then three hours going back up.""
If something goes wrong, there's an emergency button. If we need to get out quickly, a small escape vessel is released, like a ping-pong ball in a bath. It's a bit scary, but it's designed to get us to the surface safely.
Rachel has made six dives so far. Last year, she went on a trip with a Russian team to a place called the Canary Islands. They went to a special site where there are many underwater volcanoes. It's a very exciting place!
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she does it so she can focus on her research on underwater volcanoes. She's very interested in these ""black smokers"", which are underwater volcanoes that shoot out black smoke.
Rachel has been a bit scared before, but it was when she went on a dive with the Americans. There was an explosion, and she thought she was going to die. But they were all okay, and they were very relieved.
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an amazing adventure. Rachel loves looking out the window and seeing the volcanoes. She feels a sense of wonder and excitement. She's very lucky to be able to see these things that no one else has seen before.

First impressions are very important. People often make a decision about us within a few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our body language, and how we talk. Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to get her degree and was very confident. She applied for a job at a school and had an interview with the head teacher. But she didn't get the job. The head teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take care of their appearance at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who take care of themselves are more likely to care about their job."" Many people forget that first impressions are important. Janet Goodwood worked in an office for 10 years, but when she applied for a promotion, she wasn't even given an interview. The director of personnel told her she didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again.
Our body language and facial expressions also affect how others see us. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 55% of our message comes from our facial expressions. When our words and facial expressions don't match, the listener will believe the non-verbal message. So, make sure your words and body language match.
It's also important not to show too much excitement or eagerness for a job. Sheila Rice got a job offer, but she reacted too enthusiastically and ended up getting a lower salary than she wanted.
Finally, knowing what to say and how to say it is important. David Artesio, a manager, suggests researching the company before the interview and having a few questions ready. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, suggests speaking in short sentences and highlighting important points.

**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
Darius (runner) I've always loved sports. I played many sports when I was young, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I decided to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and getting a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much attention from the media, which was a shame. I wanted some sponsorship to help with my training, but it's not cheap. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun, with good athletics facilities and a lively nightlife. You have to be very disciplined, though. If friends ask me to go out the night before a training session, I have to say no. Dedication is important in this sport. My goal is to get to the next Olympics.
Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn. If you want to be good, you have to give up late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I love sleeping in and usually have to give that up too. It's worth it, though, because without dedication I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a big win, I like to celebrate with a night out and if there's money involved, I'll go somewhere nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning that championship meant I got a TV show about surfing. I'm a bit famous now.
Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win well. People say we act a bit silly when we're out, but we don't try to get attention. Sometimes reporters are more interested in where we go to celebrate than how we did in the race. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's great to get back and do normal things with my friends. You can't live and breathe the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I don't get recognized on the street often. I'd hate to be famous. I get nice letters from people asking for signed pictures, though, and I always reply.
Tomas (tennis player) It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd supporting me. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Despite that, I still get a thrill when I'm recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. However, it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. As a tennis player, you have to travel a lot, and that's why we split up. That was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport. I'm content to focus on my game now and catch up on other things in life when I retire, because that comes soon in this sport."

Shopping with children can be very difficult for some mothers. They always want everything they see. If it's not a new breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. The mother feels guilty if she buys it for them because she knows it's not good for them. But if she says no, she feels bad too. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she worries that she's not letting them make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes when they're shopping with their parents. Advertisers spend a lot of money to make children want to buy things. They use attractive and emotional ads to make children want things. Parents often don't understand why their children want something, and they argue about it. Some parents think it's good to let children make their own choices, but it's hard to do.
According to Susan Dibb, a food expert, parents are worried about what they give their children to eat. They have ideas about what is healthy, but they're not always right. If parents and children talk about food, it's good because children only see one side of the story from TV ads. Parents feel like they're competing with advertisers and are forced to say no to their children.
Some parents get stressed when deciding what to buy for their children. One mother said she talks to her son about food and labels, so he's critical of ads. They don't have many conflicts in the supermarket because the children don't ask for things she won't buy.
Parents also admit they're not consistent when saying yes or no to their children's requests. Mike, a father, says he's inconsistent too. He refuses to buy sweets for his son because they're bad for him, but he buys chocolate for himself. It's hard to be consistent.
Supermarkets could make it easier for parents by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This could make parents want to shop more without their children."

Ice Skating: A Fun and Healthy Activity
Ice skating has a long history. People used animal bone skates thousands of years ago. In Scandinavia, skating was important for the upper class. In the past, skating was a fashionable and elegant activity. However, in the 1920s, a young girl named Sonja Henie changed the way people skated. She introduced a more athletic style, and this made skating more popular.
To start ice skating, you need to be balanced and controlled. Your body position is important. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees slightly bent too. This will help you stay balanced. It's also important to relax while skating. If you're tense, you might fall.
To get started, stand with your heels almost touching and your feet pointing outwards. Move your back foot forward while making a small movement with your other foot. This might seem easy, but it takes practice to get it right.
Even experienced skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, try to relax and roll with the fall. To get up, get into a kneeling position and then stand up.
There are different types of ice skating, such as figure skating, free skating, and speed skating. To start, it's best to learn figure skating and then move on to elementary free skating. Most ice rinks offer lessons and guidance to help you learn.
To improve your skating, practice regularly and do exercises to loosen up your legs, back, and shoulders. This will help you stay relaxed and flexible. Skating is a great way to improve your balance, coordination, and overall health.

'Young Champions
Do you know what makes children very happy? It's when they get a medal! Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives. They told her about the good and the hard parts of being a champion.
A. Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the Olympics one day. 'I work very hard every day. I don't have time for TV or playing with friends. Sometimes I feel very tired, but my coach gives me a day off. Usually, I just keep going.'
B. Annika's mother 'Annika was very good at gymnastics from a young age. We didn't push her, but she wanted to do it herself. Being a champion takes a lot of time and energy. People say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but we love what gymnastics has done for Annika. She used to be shy, but now she's confident and has made many friends.'
C. Sarah Stokes loves show-jumping. She started when she was 10 and has won many competitions. 'My parents like show-jumping too, so they help me train and take me to shows. I love the excitement and fun of competitions. I want to qualify for the British young riders team and win a gold medal at the Olympics.'
D. Sarah's mother 'Sarah loved horses from a young age. When she was 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To compete in big shows, we have to travel all over England. We sleep in our horse box to save money. Sarah is very organized and loves being on a horse.'
E. Jane McShane, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion. 'I like playing chess because it's fun and I know everyone. When I play, I sometimes get distracted and don't think about the game. I don't like talking about my success at school because I don't want to be embarrassed.'
F. Jane's mother 'Jane started playing chess when she was 5. My father said, ""Let's see if she likes it."" Jane loved it from the start. She's very good and beats adults now. If she wants to stop playing chess, I wouldn't stop her. I just want her to be happy and use her talent.'

Chris Greener, who is now Britain's tallest man, wanted to join the navy when he left school. When he was 14, he was already 1.98 meters tall. Every year, people in Europe are getting a little bit taller. This is because our ancestors used to eat a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and animals. This made them strong and healthy. 
However, about 9,000 years ago, people started farming. This meant that people only ate a few types of food, like wheat, rice, and maize. This diet was not good for people's health. 
As a result, people became shorter and weaker. In one study, scientists found that when people started eating corn, they became sick and underweight. 
But now, some countries like the US, Holland, and Japan are eating a more varied diet again. This means that people are getting taller again. The average height in these countries is now 179-180 cm. 
However, there are some problems. Beds and planes are still the same size as they were 150 years ago. And clothes manufacturers are having to make new sizes all the time. 
Scientists think that people might keep getting taller, but we might also start to shrink again because of global warming.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being recorded? I recently had the chance to find out. Studio audiences are a normal part of TV shows, but many of us don't really understand what it's like to be there. We might see people laughing and clapping on game shows and wonder who they are. Studio audiences are often thought of as being made up of people who want to be famous, but that's not true. They come from all sorts of backgrounds and professions. TV producers try to get different types of people to watch different types of shows.
You might wonder why anyone would want to sit in a studio and watch TV when you can do it from home. One reason is that people might hope to appear on TV for a second. I met someone who said that's why she came to the studio. Another reason is that people are curious to see how TV shows are made. But many people just got tickets from a friend.
Not many of us have ever been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers and follow signs that tell you when to clap or laugh. But not all TV shows need these signs. I recently sat in a studio and saw that it's not always like what you see on TV. The actors were far away, and I had to watch the show on a screen. But for most people, it was just a fun and free night out.

My favourite places are not empty and wild. I like places with people and history. When I travel, I like to visit old villages with temples. When I was a child, I went to school in England and on Saturdays, I would cycle to a village called Lastingham. I loved exploring the hills and valleys. It was like home, but different. I still visit there today.
I like to take a small train from Hythe to Dungeness. The scenery is not special, but I like looking at the ordinary things people do in their daily lives. We pass through back gardens and see people doing everyday things like making tea or washing dishes. I like to imagine what their lives are like.
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and quiet coast. The beaches are hard to reach, so there are not many people. It's a good place to relax and enjoy the sea. You can also go on walks in the valleys and see oak trees, ferns, and wild flowers.
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a big, empty space with moors and hills. There are not many people, and it's peaceful. I discovered it by chance when I was a student, and I go back every year. It's a special place for me, and now I take my son there too.
I bought a house in Glenthorne, which is my favourite place in Britain. I wanted to be alone and connect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but I went to school in Devon when I was 12. I used to cycle around the moors and village streets. There was a place we never cycled past because we thought it was haunted. That place was Glenthorne. It's a magical, secluded, and romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds.

WE LOVE ANIMALS My family and I love animals. One day, my daughter found a beautiful pine snake. She asked if we could keep it. I said yes, but only for one night. We have a special tank for animals that pass through. I was running late, so I quickly boiled some water. When I got home, my sons were screaming for help. Domino, our cat, had caught a mouse and was running around the room. I tripped and fell, and then I saw the snake. It had escaped from its tank and was slithering around the floor. The cat, mouse, and kids were all running around, and the snake was hissing and striking. I was worried, but I finally managed to catch the cat and free the mouse. The snake was very strong and hard to handle. I sat on the floor, rocking back and forth, and eventually the snake relaxed and let me pick it up. I took it to the garden and let it go. It slid up my shoulders and settled there, like a warm blanket. We stood there in silence, and then my son said, ""You're nice and warm, Mum, and the shed isn't."" I got the kids to help me encourage the snake to move on. It slowly went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. When it was gone, my three-year-old son said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!"""

""Write to me! In today's world of phones and computers, writing letters is becoming less popular. But I think there's something special about receiving a letter. There's the excitement of waiting for it to arrive, the pleasure of seeing who it's from, and the joy of reading what they've written. I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember. When I was young, I would write notes to my mother. My mother always wanted me to write thank-you letters for presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I moved to London to study medicine, I would write to my mother once a week. Sometimes my father would write too, and his letters were always fun to read. Most of the letters from home were about everyday things that happened to my parents and their friends. We would also talk on the phone, but I remember the letters more.
I've also had letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I seemed to meet people who had to be away for work or study, so we would stay in touch by writing. I found that I could express myself better in writing than talking.
I love getting letters with birthday or Christmas cards. A note is nice, but it's even better to get a year's worth of news! And it's extra special if it's a letter from someone in another country, with a special stamp.
I have penfriends in Sri Lanka, Australia, and Canada. If I hadn't met them in different places, I wouldn't be able to write to them. It's important to keep writing letters because it helps us stay in touch and learn more about each other. My children are also learning to write letters, just like I did. I'm glad that they are carrying on the tradition.""

There are different opinions on how to protect the site. Some experts think that the whole mountain should be closed to the public, except for guided tours. Others think that it's better to let people visit the site, but with guides and rules to prevent damage.
The problem is that it's hard to find the money to protect the site. The government has declared it a historic site, but there is no money to hire guards or rope off the area. The experts are worried that if they don't take action, the drawings will be lost for future generations.'

Here is a simplified version of the passage for a B1 learner:
Shopping with children can be very difficult for some mothers. They always want to buy everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. The mother feels guilty when she says no to her children's requests because she doesn't want to buy them unhealthy food. But she also feels bad when she says yes because she knows it's not good for them. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she worries that she's not letting them make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they're shopping with their parents. A lot of money is spent advertising to children, especially on TV. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy them everything they want. They don't understand that the advertisements are trying to persuade them to buy things.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that parents are concerned about what their children eat, but they may not always know what is healthy. She thinks it's good that parents and children talk about food, but it's hard for parents to compete with advertisements. The Independent Television Commission says that advertisers can't tell children to ask their parents to buy something, but the goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something.
Some parents feel stressed when they're shopping with their children because they have to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says that she talks to her children about different products and reads the labels with them. She's happy that they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy anymore.
Parents also admit that they're not always consistent when it comes to buying things for their children. They might say no to their child's request for sweets because it's not good for them, but then they buy unhealthy food for themselves. Supermarkets could make shopping easier for parents by moving sweets to a different part of the store or providing a play area for children. This might make parents want to shop there more often."

""Climbing is no longer just for mountains. Today, you can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is watching in awe as French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down from his fingertips on the climbing wall at the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham. The National Indoor Arena is usually known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. This is all thanks to new technology.
In the past, climbers would climb on cliffs, but this was only possible during certain times of the year. In the winter, they would either get cold, go for a walk, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. However, climbers needed to stay fit, so they started using brick edges or stone buildings to practice. This helped keep their fingers strong and prevented boredom. Many sports centers built climbing walls with special edges, following the example of Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s.
Robinson's idea was to set natural rock in concrete and include it in a wall. Many climbing walls were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s. However, they had some problems. Walls could only be built straight up and down, unlike cliffs, which have overhangs and angled rocks. Climbers would eventually get bored with the same old walls, even if they thought of every possible combination of holds.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a material that could be molded into shapes like those found on cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any existing wall and removed when climbers got bored. French manufacturers also experimented with panels on steel frames. Steel frames could be set up anywhere and were lighter than concrete, making it possible to create overhanging walls without major construction work. This system allowed climbers to have endless new holds to try."""

Do you want to be an actor? If you tell people you want to be an actor, they will often say it's a risky career. And it's true, there are many people who want to be actors, but not enough jobs for everyone. Some friends might think you're crazy for choosing this career, but others might be supportive. There is no easy way to become an actor. You can't just pass a test and be sure you'll succeed. It's a matter of luck and being good at what you do.
There is a demand for new actors, and it can be exciting and glamorous. But it's not always easy. You have to be brave and believe in yourself and your work. It's hard to explain why you want to be an actor, but it's often because of the feeling you get when you're on stage and connecting with the audience.
Actors don't usually know the secret to their success. They just know what works for them and what doesn't. They know that they can't take anything for granted, because their success might not last. Disappointment is the biggest enemy of an actor. They might have been working one day and then not have any work the next. They have to find ways to deal with the stress of trying out for parts and the possibility of being rejected.
It's hard to talk about your chances of getting a part. Actors try to protect themselves from the stress and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, the possibility of rejection is there from the very beginning. You're saying you're available, willing, and talented enough for the job. And it's up to you, because if you don't care, nobody else will."

Instead, we're going back to what our ancestors were like 40,000 years ago. 
For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and animals. This diet was very healthy and made them strong and tall. However, about 9,000 years ago, people started farming and this had a negative impact on their health. They began to eat fewer foods and became shorter and less healthy. 
In some places, like the US, Europe, and Japan, people are now eating a more balanced diet and their average height is increasing. This is good news, but it also means that we need to make sure our buildings and clothes are designed for taller people. 
But here's a surprise: scientists think that, as a species, humans are actually getting smaller. This is because our ancestors were bigger and rounder during the last ice age, which made them better at keeping warm. Since the climate warmed up, we've become thinner and smaller. And as the planet continues to warm up, we might even get smaller again. This means that the growth of humans could be stopped by global warming."

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are making a business out of a childhood game. They are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, playing the game pichenotte. Their grandfather brought the game from Canada, where it was popular among his family. The game is played on a wooden board with round pieces. The family played it every weekend and holiday, and visitors were often fascinated by it.
One day, Dave decided to make a new board because the old one was broken. His relatives and friends liked it, and soon people were asking for more. The brothers took a board to a sports bar and people started playing it. They were surprised to find that people enjoyed it.
Dave researched the game's history and found that it originated in India, where a similar game called carroms is played. The game was brought to Canada by British people and became popular in Quebec, where it was called pichenotte.
The game is played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces, which they flick across the board using their fingers. The goal is to get your pieces into a small hole or into the rings around it. The game is over after two minutes.
The brothers started selling the boards at markets and craft fairs, and people loved it. They even started a championship and a trophy. The game became so popular that the brothers had to make more boards. They set up a workshop in their garage and started producing boards. They are now selling them online for $595 each.
The brothers are happy to be making a living from the game they love. They hope to one day have a luxury car and a big house. For now, they are just enjoying the success of their childhood game."

Welcome to the Model Village! When I first came here, I couldn't believe that this was once a piece of empty land covered in brambles. For years, people thought it was useless. But one man, with the help of his wife, turned it into this beautiful place. They moved a lot of soil and clay to create the hills and valleys you see today. It was hard work, but they used machines and did a lot of manual labor. They brought in 1,000 tons of soil to create the lawns, flowerbeds, and rockeries. They planted many trees and shrubs, but only those that could survive the salty air near the sea and strong winds. The plants came from local gardens and even from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.
The idea for the Model Village came from Colin Sims, and he made over 100 models himself over nine years. He used different materials like stone, concrete, and plastic to make the models strong and weather-resistant. He had to learn a lot about how to make them, but he became an expert. The models are very detailed and accurate, and the builders paid attention to every small detail. This took a lot of patience and special techniques.
The Model Village is very popular, and people come from all over to see it. The models are so realistic that they have even been used in other model villages and in college courses. The buildings in the village are all typical British styles, but not based on any specific place or building. One of the most impressive is the Manor House, a 13th-century-style stone building with a brick tower and stone walls.
As you walk around the village, you'll see a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models, as it can take a long time to repair them. You can take photos from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are allowed on a short leash. We would love to hear your comments and suggestions, as we are always planning new models and updating the village. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know. We hope you enjoy your visit and will come back soon!"

""Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break their own rules. Although some famous people sometimes take pictures with the paparazzi, this is not common. Usually, people in the public eye are hurt when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, few people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC was created to deal with these kinds of issues. Rarely, if ever, do these pictures serve the public interest. Do pictures of famous people help to solve a crime? How did a famous actress's hotel room picture protect public health and safety? The actress had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. The PCC should investigate this and other cases.
One idea is for the PCC to take the initiative and stop these shameful attacks. This could lead to many newspapers being punished. This would be reported by other newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would not support it, and editors would have to stop publishing these pictures. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to make a living taking pictures of celebrities. However, there are many problems with this idea. How would the PCC decide whether to investigate a case? Should it ask the person involved to make a complaint? And what if they refuse? Celebrities and royalty might expect the PCC to investigate any story about them, and then be upset if it doesn't. The PCC's role is too big. How could it monitor all British newspapers, national and local? There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy has been invaded, they might not want the added embarrassment of an investigation. Many people just want to move on with their lives. A few might have other reasons for staying quiet. They might have a worse story that they have kept secret, and they know that if they complain, this story could become public too. Even the PCC might become the enemy. A British comedian was also a victim of the press when his honeymoon was secretly photographed. He didn't complain then, and not even when his family was again photographed on holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would run the pictures again with a new story about his anger. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It's hard to see a simple solution to this serious problem."""

When you have a job for a while, you might think about moving to a new one. This article is for people who are looking for a new job, not a temporary one to fill a gap, and not one they're leaving because they're unhappy. You're looking for a job that fits with your long-term plans. You need to think about what you want to do in your career. Do you want to specialize in one area, take on more responsibility, or move to a new field? Whatever you choose, you should think carefully about your new job. You should stay in it for at least two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job, as it will show that you have a plan for your career.
It's also a good time to think about traveling. You can take some time off and then come back to your job. Employers will see that you've had an adventure and are not likely to want to travel again.
Juliette Davidson worked for three solicitors after leaving college. It was a good first job because the people were friendly and she learned new skills. However, there was no chance to move up. She left and traveled for a year, and now she works as a Personal Assistant to a Chief Executive. She's been in the job for two and a half years and has become more confident and responsible. Her boss has given her new tasks and responsibilities, and she's involved in many projects.

Confident people: What's their secret?
Some people may seem confident, but most of them will tell you that it's a skill they've learned. Nina Hathway asked five people how they did it.
A. Jenny
I used to be shy when I left school. But when I helped at my daughter's school, I surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was nervous at first, but my confidence grew as I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.
B. Michaela
I took over my family business when my father was ill. I was scared and became a bit too bossy. I thought confident people were like that, but I learned otherwise. To be confident, you have to believe in yourself. If things get too hard, I don't feel guilty if I do things tomorrow. When I'm scared, I tell myself I have nothing to lose.
C. Lisa
People think I'm confident, but I'm actually very nervous. I had to learn to look confident because it's important in TV. Interviewing people made me realize that everyone gets nervous in important situations. The best advice I got was from my mother: ""Who's looking at you? Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves."" I also learned that you gain confidence by doing things that scare you.
D. Barbara
My confidence comes from enjoying my work. I've built it up over the years by learning from my mistakes. If you just get on with it and learn from your mistakes, you'll be more confident next time. I work hard and like myself, not trying to be what others expect.
E. Kim
After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak up in meetings. Eventually, I found the courage to speak up. When I started working in politics, I was nervous and would shake. I told myself, ""Don't be silly. People do this every day."" I also wrote down some points to refer to. I think everyone is a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret of confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""

Paul Forster went to a kite-flying festival in Malaysia. He met a man named Adnan Ali, who gave him a kite as a gift. Adnan said, 'You have to keep it. It's a tradition. If the string breaks, the finder gets to keep it.' Adnan showed Paul his collection of kites. They were all the same size and made of paper and bamboo. They sat in the shade of some tall trees and looked out at the festival. There were 10 platforms with helpers holding up kites, and people waiting to fly their kites. When the whistle blew, the kites went up in the air like rockets. Over 500 people had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days. Each person had made four different kites to be judged on how they looked, how stable they were, and how well they flew.
Adnan invited Paul to visit him at his home to learn how to make kites. Paul accepted and went to Adnan's house. They drank tea and ate snacks in a big room. Adnan told Paul to come back the next day to help him rebuild his kite, but Paul couldn't. Instead, he went to explore the state of Kelantan. He drove to the mountains and took a wrong turn, ending up at a river. A boat took him across, and he saw a sign that said 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km'. He walked up the path and met a man named Baba, who ran a small camp. Paul decided to stay there for the night. The next morning, he woke up to a beautiful view of the mountains. In the afternoon, it started raining. Paul got wet and worried about his car getting swept away. But everything was okay, and he was back in Kota Bahru, the capital, where everyone was friendly and asked him questions. Paul remembered Kelantan for its kind people, not just its kites."
