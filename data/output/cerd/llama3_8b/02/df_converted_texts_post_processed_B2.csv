Paying for trash bags: a waste of money? 
In many countries, people throw away their trash without paying for it. But is this a good idea? Some economists think not. They believe that if people have to pay for their trash, they will produce less of it and recycle more. This makes sense, but it's not that simple.
In some American towns, people have started paying for their trash bags. This means that households are charged for each bag of trash they throw away. The idea is that this will encourage people to reduce the amount of trash they produce and recycle more. But a study by two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this approach didn't work as well as expected.
In one town, Charlottesville, Virginia, people were charged 80 cents for each trash bag. This led to a 37% reduction in the number of bags used. However, people simply filled the bags more, which didn't make a big difference in the end. The weight of the trash collected only decreased by 14%. In other towns where people didn't have to pay for their trash, the weight of the trash collected also decreased, but not as much.
The study also found that some people started dumping their trash illegally instead of paying for it. This made it hard to measure the effect of the trash bag policy. The only positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, but this might have happened anyway.
The economists concluded that charging for trash bags doesn't make a big difference in the amount of trash produced. It would take a much bigger change, such as buying fewer products, to make a significant impact. They suggest that other factors, like income and education, might play a bigger role in reducing waste.
While charging for trash bags might not be the best solution, it's still important to find ways to reduce waste. The study shows that simple policies can have complex effects, and we need to consider all the factors before making a decision."

Many people are not satisfied with their jobs. They feel undervalued and unappreciated. Success is no longer enough; we need to ask ourselves what our job does to our personal growth, relationships, and well-being. Our skills are not just about making a living, but about being a fulfilled human being. We need to rethink how we approach work, making it a way to discover our talents, connect with others, and find meaning.
The problem is not just about unemployment, but about the kind of jobs we have. Many people are unhappy in their careers, even if they are successful. Doctors, accountants, and architects often feel stressed and unfulfilled. We need to find ways to make work more enjoyable and meaningful.
I am exploring different occupations to see how they affect people's lives. I am looking at how different cultures have viewed human potential and how we can create a sense of purpose and fulfillment in our work. I believe that work should be a way to become a better person, not just a way to earn a living.
For example, in the hospitality industry, many people are underutilized and unhappy. Hotels could be more than just a place to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could be encouraged to use their skills and talents, rather than just doing menial tasks.
Work is a relationship, and we need to rethink what this means. We need to give people the freedom to design their own jobs, choose their own colleagues, and communicate effectively with others. We need to move beyond traditional categories and find new ways to make work more meaningful and fulfilling.
I hope this version captures the main ideas and themes of the original text while making it more accessible to a B2 level learner."

""BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand. It's a metaphor that implies planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The idea is that there is a central source of resources that can be used to spread and reproduce information. But why did a new technology that transmits words and pictures electronically become organized in a way that fits this agricultural metaphor?
Television, as a technology, is related to other forms of two-way communication, like the telephone and telegraph. It's surprising that it was seen as a centralized'mass' medium from the start. This was because it fit with the social and economic structures of modern societies. Attempts to organize it differently were just that - attempts.
In the 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television, but big business and the government eventually shut them down. In the US, television was primarily seen as a medium for theatrical exhibitions, and was often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In other countries, public viewing of television was common.
Despite the idea of grass-roots or amateur television, the dominant structure of broadcasting was centralized and focused on reaching a dispersed audience through public settings. This fit with the modern idea of the home as a place for entertainment and cultural experiences.
As people's standards of living improved and they entered consumer society, the idea of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for most people. This is happening on a global scale today.
There is a clear relationship between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernization led to centralization and concentration of power, the break-up of traditional communities created new ways of life. Centralized broadcasting was seen as a way to reach all citizens with important information efficiently and to produce a sense of national unity.
However, what is often left out of this story is the idea of broadcasting as a way to secure equal access to resources for democratic participation in political, social, and cultural life. As television changes, the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated, and we may see it as a particular organization of audio-visual technology during a specific phase of social modernization.""

""Feeling Secure with Possessions
It's natural to want to own things that make us feel safe and comfortable. However, sometimes we can get carried away with buying and accumulating possessions, and this can lead to feelings of insecurity. Advertisers often use clever tactics to make us feel like we need things we don't really need. They make us feel like we're not good enough if we don't have certain products.
But have you ever noticed how many advertisements there are around us? They're everywhere - on billboards, TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and even on the internet. They're designed to persuade us to buy, buy, buy. And it's not just advertisements. Even scientific research can be influenced by our desire to acquire things.
Caves and Research
Caves are fascinating natural formations that have been studied by scientists for a long time. Researchers have spent years studying caves to learn about their origins, how they're formed, and what lives in them. Caves are also a source of curiosity for many people, and this has led to a lot of research and exploration.
Weather and Observation
Meteorology is the study of the weather, and it's a complex science that has been developed over the centuries. We used to rely on our own observations to predict the weather, but now we have advanced technology like satellites and computers to help us. However, human observation is still an important part of weather forecasting. Our own experiences and observations can provide valuable information that helps meteorologists make accurate predictions.""

'Music and Theatre: A New Perspective
Until recently, I thought opera was primarily a form of theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first. This is as it should be. I come from a world where the spoken word is primary, where there is no director controlling the action once the performance begins, and where performers and audience members mostly speak the same language. In contrast, music performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, often have a significant number of people who don't understand music. Some may feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge, while others are in awe of the performers' skills. A great musician's hard work is evident, and it's easy to admire their talent. Watching a top-class music performance is like watching an athletic event - we recognize the effort and skill involved, even if we couldn't achieve it ourselves.
Theatre audiences, on the other hand, have different expectations. They don't fully understand the skill involved in acting and are not often impressed by something that seems similar to what they could do themselves. They might ask an actor how they memorize their lines. This doesn't mean theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; in fact, many are the same people. Perhaps what it means is that audiences and performers connect on more equal terms in theatre than in music.
I think music could learn from theatre about this relationship. I've seen how a different approach can enhance the concert-goer's experience. Music is inherently theatrical, with passion, humor, and intimacy. However, the conventions that dominate music presentations, such as strict dress codes and deference to conductors and soloists, emphasize the difference between performers and listeners, creating a hierarchical atmosphere. On the other hand, interrupting the performance with applause can be insensitive to the overall work.
Is there a solution? Of course, there is. Efforts are underway to encourage new audiences and break down barriers. I recall a remarkable event, Jonathan Dove's community opera In Search of Angels, which combined professional musicians with community participation. It was a life-changing experience for many audience members. What I yearn for in music is a bit more of the risk and radicalism that theatre can display. Sometimes, this comes from using unconventional locations, disrupting normal expectations. This can have a profound impact on both performers and audience.
I believe that music can and should change its conventions. As an enthusiast, I love and support both theatre and music. I want them to thrive and for more people to experience the joy I get from being an audience member.'"

I don't like sand when it's not used to make things like glass or concrete. It's just a nuisance when it's on the beach. It gets everywhere, makes a mess, and sticks to you when you're wet. But when you sit on a towel or walk on a clean floor, it suddenly disappears. It's as if it's stuck to you forever! I'm not a fan of sand.
The search for a safe and secure home has been going on for a long time. People want to feel safe and protected from harm. Locks and keys are a way to achieve this. Even with modern technology, people still prefer the feeling of turning a physical key in a lock. A locksmith company recently developed an electronic lock that still has a physical key. It's a mix of old and new.
I was worried about visiting the Tate Modern art gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some pieces, like sculptures and big photographs. But I don't know much about art. The idea is that art should communicate with you, not just be something you try to understand. The Tate Modern has labels that explain what each piece is about, which helped me understand it better. I used to just stare at the pictures, but now I can see what they're trying to say.

Adapting novels for film is a process of cutting down and focusing on the most important parts. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be helpful. When working on a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and description from the novel while still keeping the main idea. This doesn't mean that the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's just that the way we pay attention to stories is different in books and movies.
In books, we need more information to understand the characters and what's happening. In movies, we can get the same information from the visuals and the acting. So, we don't need as much repetition or extra details.
Watching movies can be a magical experience. It's like being transported to a different world. We can forget about our everyday problems and just enjoy the story. But when the movie is over, we snap back to reality and don't feel like we've been changed by the experience.
In the past, people didn't think movies were a serious art form. They saw them as just entertainment. But now, many people want to make their own movies. There are many books and courses to help them do it. Some people even make successful movies with very little money.
The film studio I visited was a confusing place. There were many small rooms, and it was hard to find your way around. But the people who worked there knew where they were going. They were making movies, and they were good at their jobs."

In those days, the council houses in the western part of the city were lined up in rows. They were made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from the nearby factory would hang in the air, making the smell of sulphur noticeable. Many mornings, you could see a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he delivered papers to the houses.
I don't remember much from my early childhood. However, I do remember sitting on a windowsill, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, I remember other faces, like my mother, ironing clothes in a room that wasn't ours. I remember the snow falling on the turrets of a big house in Earlham.
My mother was a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, and I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, I noticed that she was a very solitary person, even in a crowded room. She had a strong sense of propriety, which sometimes led to furious cleaning sessions or strict rules about behavior.
As I grew up, I realized that my mother's behavior was influenced by her upbringing and her friends. She had a few close friends, like Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who never said much, and Mrs. Laband, who was a bit more lively but also a bit disapproved of by the others. These women would often talk about their problems, such as bad health, the weather, and ungrateful children. I often felt like I was included in this category.
Looking back, it seemed like a heavy burden was weighing me down - the houses, my mother, her friends, and the need to behave properly. I felt like I had to grow up and break free from this weight. However, it wasn't easy.
In West Earlham, growing up followed a predictable pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and got under your parents' feet. Then, at age five, you went to school. If you were lucky, your mother would take you on a rickety bike with a child seat. Otherwise, you would walk with other children from the street. I remember the summer holidays, when we would catch glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. We would visit neighbors, attend charity events, or go to the museum.
My mother was strict and didn't like politicians. She thought they were only interested in money. She would take me to the museum on Sundays, where we would walk hand-in-hand, looking at paintings. My mother wasn't opposed to this, and eventually, she even developed opinions about the art. I remember her once saying, ""I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"" about a painting of a Roman soldier. This was a rare moment of humor from my mother.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a B2 learner:
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The street was getting darker, and the air was thick with humidity. I knew this side of the street from when I was a child. There were houses where my friends lived, and a grocery store where my family shopped. As I walked, I noticed that the houses got smaller and the porches lower. Over the years, some of the houses had changed. Wooden porch rails had been replaced with iron ones, and some stores had become homes again.
I visited a friend, Rick Gilbert, who lives in a former curtain warehouse. He wanted to make his space feel more like a home, so he divided it up with a big piece of plastic. He also added a kitchen and some sentimental furniture. He likes to cook for his friends and work from home.
Bruce Chatwin was a famous writer who loved to travel. His book, ""In Patagonia,"" is a classic. He mixed fact and fiction to create a thrilling story. Chatwin believed that traveling could help us discover new things and learn about the past.
One summer, I was swimming in my backyard pool during a heavy rainstorm. The raindrops created a lot of bubbles, and I felt like I was swimming in a magical world. I realized that swimming could be a way to escape and explore new places. Most of us are used to following signs and maps, but swimming allows us to break free and discover new things.
I decided to take a long swim through Britain, following the rain and the sea. I wanted to break free from the routine of swimming laps and explore the unknown. I believed that this journey would help me regain a sense of wonder and adventure."

Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no particular reason. But scientists now think that crying is important for social reasons. For example, a psychiatrist named John Bowlby found that crying helps children form a strong bond with their mothers. Many people believe that children cry when they're helpless, but it's harder to understand why adults still cry. It seems that the sound of crying is less important than the way it makes us look. In the past, crying might have helped early human communities feel more connected and trusting. We might also cry to show sympathy for others who are suffering. Sometimes we cry involuntarily, like when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. We might cry when watching a sad movie, but it's more likely to happen when we're with others. The importance of crying for social reasons seems clear, but scientists are still studying it.

The Earth is getting warmer due to global warming. We know it's happening, but we're not sure exactly how much warmer it will get and how it will affect our lives. Climate change will bring changes to the weather all over the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to every part of the planet, any changes to the climate will have significant effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
We've learned to use natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support our population. Any changes to these resources are important to consider. The problem is that we're not sure exactly how the world will change and what's causing these changes. We do know that human activities have increased the concentration of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are building up and may already be affecting the climate.
Scientists use computer models to predict the future. These models are based on laws of physics and chemistry and can analyze the interaction of temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, these models are simplified and have limitations. They can only provide approximate results and are slow and expensive to run.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we've experienced before. The predictions suggest that the average global temperature will rise by 1-3.5°C by 2100, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts will become more frequent.
Climate change will affect the natural environment and human societies. It will impact the geographical locations of ecosystems, the mix of species, and the resources we rely on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some areas will experience negative effects, while others may benefit. For example, warmer temperatures have increased wheat production in Australia.
However, many predicted effects of climate change will be negative. Small changes in climate can affect the availability of water, leading to droughts and water shortages. This will be a problem in arid and semi-arid regions and areas with existing water shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is already experiencing decreasing precipitation totals and changing seasonality.
Climate change will also affect glaciers, which will impact vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. The Arctic's ice cover may melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.
The most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the melting of ice. Half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, which will be severely affected by rising sea levels. This will lead to flooding, inundation, and displacement of people, potentially creating millions of environmental refugees. Small, low-lying island states will be particularly affected, with entire countries potentially ceasing to exist if worst-case scenarios occur."

Art and the way we think about it can be confusing. We often focus on the physical objects themselves, like paintings or sculptures, instead of what they do to and in our experience. This can make it hard to understand what art is and what it means.
When we consider a work of art as a separate entity, it can become isolated from the context in which it was created and the way it affects our lives. This can make it difficult to see the bigger picture and understand its significance.
To understand art, we need to connect it to our everyday experiences and the world around us. This means looking at the ordinary things we do and the scenes we encounter, and seeing how they can be beautiful and meaningful.
Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comic strips, but they might not consider them ""art"" because they are not in a museum or gallery. However, these things can be just as enjoyable and meaningful as more traditional forms of art.
The problem is that many people separate art from everyday life, and this can make it hard to appreciate the beauty and significance of art. When we connect art to the things we do and experience every day, we can gain a deeper understanding of its value and importance.
For example, when we appreciate the beauty of nature, we are not just looking at a pretty view, we are experiencing the world around us. Similarly, when we appreciate a work of art, we are not just looking at a painting or sculpture, we are experiencing the emotions and ideas it evokes.
To understand art, we need to look at it in the context of our everyday lives, and see how it can enrich and enhance our experiences. This is the task of the philosopher who studies art: to connect the beauty and significance of art to the world around us."

Observing Lions
When we think of lions hunting, we imagine a group of cats working together like a well-rehearsed team. They seem like perfect examples of social animals, putting aside their differences to achieve a common goal. But after spending many years studying lions in the wild, we have a different view. We wanted to understand why they hunt together, care for their young, and chase away rivals. If we measure an animal's success by how many babies it has, then working together doesn't always pay off. So, why don't lions just look out for themselves? We thought we would quickly find the answer, but lions are experts at doing nothing. It's taken us a long time to figure out their behavior, and now we're only just starting to understand.
Pop Music Review
Bedrock's third album, New Life, was a game-changer in the music world. It marked a shift away from the serious and angsty sound of the past and towards a lighter, more melodic style. The album combined social commentary and strong emotions with the sounds of fairgrounds and northern brass bands. The band's songwriters were skilled at collecting ideas and experimenting with different styles. They wrote about everyday life, but also explored deeper emotions on songs like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink"". The album's greatest strength is its consistency - 16 tracks with no filler is a rare achievement.
Extract from an Autobiography
As a child, I was fascinated by the stories of the Sibyl, wise women who had great influence in ancient times. My mother told me about an old woman who offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold coins, but he refused. She then offered him six books for the same price, and he refused again. Finally, she sold him the remaining three books for the full 300 gold coins. I realized even then that there was a valuable lesson hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was often a lonely child, but my mother taught me to do something interesting so that other kids would want to join me. I've never forgotten that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something that interested me and was relevant to my life. I'm not a big fan of traveling, but I love exploring the past through ruins.

The 1990s were a challenging time for advertising agencies. The global recession had a severe impact on businesses, leading to job losses, home repossessions, and a decline in consumer spending. Advertisers, in particular, felt under pressure to deliver results with smaller budgets. They were expected to create effective campaigns with limited resources, making it a difficult time for those in the industry.
Despite the challenges, the importance of marketing and advertising was becoming more recognized. Companies were starting to understand the need to produce products and services that customers wanted, rather than just what was convenient for them. This shift led to a greater emphasis on marketing and a rise in the status of marketing professionals.
However, this increased importance also brought new pressures. Advertisers were expected to produce high-quality work with minimal budgets, and clients were demanding better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement. The industry was facing a crisis, with many companies questioning the effectiveness of advertising.
The recession had also led to a re-examination of the costs and benefits of advertising. Clients wanted to see a clear return on their investment, and advertisers were struggling to deliver. The industry was under scrutiny, with many companies seeking better results from their advertising agencies.
The challenges facing advertisers were not limited to the recession. Demographic changes, the rise of retailers, changing consumer needs, and legal restrictions on advertising all added to the difficulties. For some companies, the challenge of advertising abroad also presented a new hurdle.
In this environment, it was difficult for advertisers to find help and guidance. Companies were too busy coping with the challenges to share their experiences, and those who had succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. As a result, the books and resources available on advertising were limited, and those that did exist often presented an unrealistic view of the industry.

Fashion is often seen as a modern concept, but it has a long history that goes back centuries. Historians of fashion argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has been around for a long time. They often point to the rise of trade and commerce in the 16th and 17th centuries as the starting point. As societies become more complex, populations grow, and new technologies for making clothes and accessories are developed, the meanings attached to clothing also become more complex. This means it's hard to say exactly what an item of clothing or accessory means today. For example, a man's suit, which seems like a uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and for different people.
As for writers, the media often portrays them as struggling to make a living, but the reality is different. Some writers have other full-time jobs to fall back on, while others, like me, have to juggle part-time jobs, teaching, and freelance writing to make ends meet. I've heard of some writers getting lucky breaks, like working for a chocolate company, but I haven't been that fortunate. Despite the challenges, writers like me manage to finish their novels with the help of friends, family, and credit cards.

'Music in the Future
Technology is changing the way we live and work, and it's also changing the way we enjoy music. In the past, we had more ways to listen to music, such as radio, TV, records, and CDs. This has led to a decline in the number of people attending live music performances and the number of full-time jobs for professional musicians.
Despite this, music is still an important part of our lives. It's a big part of many national events and provides opportunities for people to express themselves and connect with others. In the future, we can expect to see more diverse types of music and more use of technology to create and perform music.
Playing a musical instrument can also have many benefits, such as improving spatial reasoning and social skills. Research has shown that playing an instrument can even help people develop good study habits and concentration.
In the short term, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching. However, in the long term, the music profession may need to adapt to changes in the way people listen to and participate in music. This could include a greater focus on community-based music-making and a wider range of musical skills being taught.
To prepare for these changes, musicians will need to be trained to teach people of all ages and backgrounds, and to work with large and diverse groups. They will also need to develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills.
Ultimately, it's important for those involved in the music profession to work together to raise the profile of music and ensure that it remains an important part of our lives.'

Actors often face criticism and disdain. Sometimes, they themselves contribute to this by talking about their work in interviews. They should remember the words of Pavlova, a famous dancer, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, they often use clichés or talk about themselves in a way that is boring and empty. 
Paul Scofield, a well-known actor, said that an actor's work only comes alive when they perform it. When they discuss it, it becomes empty and theoretical. Every play is a new challenge, and actors must start from scratch each time. 
Adrian Lester's performance in Hamlet is impressive. He plays a young man who is both angry and funny. He uses his body and voice to bring the character to life. 
So, what is acting? Is it just imitating behavior or is it something more? Who or what brings characters to life? These are the questions that are at the heart of the theatre.
One director's approach to rehearsal is called ""dropping in."" The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, and then they find their own way to respond. They don't plan what they will say, but instead let their thoughts and feelings guide them.
The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. The staff should feel like they are part of the performance, not just doing a job. The auditorium should be designed to make the audience feel connected to the performers. It's important to have a sense of history and tradition in the theatre. The plays should be chosen carefully, and the audience should be surprised and engaged.

Rock and roll music in the 1950s was mainly popular among young people, but it had a big impact on middle-class adults too. It paved the way for new rock stars and influenced the music of future generations. For Paul Simon, listening to Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, was a crucial part of his musical journey. The show was a must-listen for many young rock fans, including John Lennon in Liverpool. Paul Simon was fascinated by the music and wanted to make his own. He didn't know what the future held, but he was determined to take small steps and be cautious.
As I walked through the snowy woods, I slipped and fell into a hidden hole. The snow had melted, leaving a thin layer on top, and I fell four feet down. I was shaken and scared, wondering what would have happened if the hole had been deeper. I sat down against a pine tree to think about my situation. I realized that I wouldn't be able to continue my plan, as I had only covered half a mile in an hour.
Qualitative Research
There are many books about qualitative research, but they often don't explain the process of analyzing data. It's not clear how researchers do it. We invited social scientists to share their approaches to data analysis, not to create a guide for new researchers. We wanted to demystify the process, making it more explicit. This wasn't easy, so we allowed our contributors to present their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal styles.

Recently, I noticed my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a little dinosaur. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he didn't know much. There is a lot of talk about using computers and the internet for learning, but is it a good way to learn? One writer tried an interactive program with his son and didn't think it was very effective.
Television, like my son's noodle-eating, is an impressionistic medium. Research shows that learning happens best when there is dialogue between teachers or parents. New technology can be useful for teaching, but there is still a big role for traditional education.

Photography was invented by artists who wanted to capture their surroundings. They found a way to create lasting images using a combination of light, lenses, and chemicals. Some artists were not happy about photography, but photographers knew they had created a new art form.
Book illustration is another art form that has changed over time. In the past, many children's books had illustrations, but some books for older readers did not. The illustrations from this time period are a mix of good and bad, but some are very valuable. There are signs that these illustrations are becoming more popular again, and we may see them in new books or exhibitions.

Blogging: Sharing Your Life with the World
Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of sharing your location online. The point was that when you post where you are, you're also telling everyone about it, not just your friends. This made people realize that there might be downsides to sharing so much on the internet.
The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with a global audience. We can post photos, stories, and even our personal thoughts. However, we often realize too late that the internet is a crowded and complex place, and we can get lost.
Fortunately, there are people who have been through this before. They are the pioneers of blogging, who started sharing their lives online years ago. They faced challenges, made mistakes, and learned from them. We can learn from their experiences.
In 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the internet. He built a website with photos, stories, and art, and people loved it. However, he also faced problems. One day, he fell in love and wrote about it on his blog, but his partner asked him to take it down. Justin's blog disappeared, and he realized that sharing too much online can make people not trust you.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, also faced problems. She wrote about her job and her colleagues, but an anonymous colleague sent her blog to her bosses. She lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where we feel like we can say anything online, but our digital life is connected to our real life. We need to be careful what we share online.
Heather Armstrong learned from her experience and now writes about her family and life as a mommy blogger. She has become a successful blogger and has learned to share her life in a responsible way. We can learn from her experience: just because we can say anything online doesn't mean we should.

Tiredness is a common problem in many countries. As people get busier and richer, they often don't get enough sleep. In the USA, 40 million people have chronic sleep problems. This is why sleep has become a popular topic in books and research. Some researchers think that people need more sleep, especially when they are busy. They suggest that people should sleep for 8-9 hours a night.
One researcher conducted an experiment to test this idea. He asked people to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. The results showed that it took them three weeks to adjust to sleeping 8 hours a night. This indicates that people can recover from sleep deprivation.
In the UK, there is a university sleep research laboratory that studies sleep and fatigue. They investigate how sleep affects people's daily lives, such as sailors and drivers. They also study how noise and traffic can affect sleep. The researchers use volunteers who are paid to take part in the studies.
The laboratory has a special simulator that looks like a car dashboard. The participants are asked to drive while answering questions. The researchers use this to study how sleep affects driving. They found that two cups of coffee can help people stay awake and safe for half an hour.
There are many theories about what sleep does for our bodies. Some scientists think that sleep helps to repair our bodies, while others believe that it helps to rest our brains. However, there is no clear answer.
Interestingly, women tend to sleep for half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep. Some scientists believe that sleep is important for our bodies to recover from the day's activities.
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. In the UK, people used to have two sleeps a night, with a break in between. This was a time for reflection and relaxation. However, with the introduction of artificial light and the industrial revolution, people started sleeping for longer periods at night.
In some non-Western cultures, people still don't have a fixed bedtime. They may sleep for a few hours and then wake up again. This is because they need to be aware of their surroundings and watch out for predators.
Overall, it seems that people all over the world need more sleep."

Vancouver is a city in western Canada that has become very popular over the past ten years. Many people from all over the world have moved there because of its mild climate, beautiful surroundings, and good education and job opportunities. The city is also very clean and safe.
People from different countries and cultures live in Vancouver, and you can hear many different languages being spoken on the streets. The city has changed a lot in recent years, with many new buildings being built. Despite some people complaining about the rapid growth, the influx of new residents and tourists has helped to revitalize the city.
Vancouver was once known as ""Terminal City"" because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much anymore, the city remains an important hub for travel.
As a journalist, I know that many of my colleagues are not good at writing letters. This is not because they are trying to make money, but because they are always trying to make their writing as effective as possible.

When the film Citizen Kane was finally released in 1941, it received great reviews, but it wasn't a commercial success. It wasn't until it was shown on television that people started talking about it again. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers. It's surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that his lack of experience in filmmaking actually helped him make the film, as he didn't know what he was or wasn't allowed to do. He had a great team working with him, including a cameraman, a screenwriter, and a special effects expert.
The idea for the film came from a conversation between Welles and the screenwriter, Herman J. Mankiewicz. They decided to make a film about a newspaper magnate who was similar to William Randolph Hearst. Welles thought this was a great opportunity for him to play the lead role and direct the film.
The film is about a man who is very powerful and successful, but also lonely and unhappy. He is a newspaper magnate who has everything, but he still feels empty inside. The film shows how he becomes obsessed with a woman and tries to win her over, but ultimately fails.
The title of the film is ""Citizen Kane"" and it is considered one of the greatest films of all time. It has been inspiring filmmakers for many years and continues to be studied and admired today.

I was in Vienna to take photographs. I had been doing this for a long time, and it was my passion. I loved the way light fell on a surface and how a single picture could capture a moment, a place, or a person. One day, I might take the perfect photograph. I always had the chance, as long as I had film in my camera. I would finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with my eyes wide open. That was my way.
I had been lucky once, when a photo of a burning oil well became famous worldwide. After that, I became a freelance photographer. But my life took some unexpected turns. The 1990s were not as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not in a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which was good enough for me.
The assignment was a surprise. I had already taken photos of London for a book about four European cities, and now the Austrian publishers wanted me to take photos of Vienna. I was given a free hand, as the other photographers were not available. I was happy to go, as things at home were not going well.
The Austrian publishers put me up at the Europa Hotel in the city center. I had been to Vienna before, but only for a short trip with my wife. It was hot and busy, and I didn't take many photos. This time, I was on my own, and I knew it would be different. I was excited to explore the city and take some great pictures.
The first day, I just rode the trams around the city, getting on and off to see the different moods of Vienna. The weather was cold and grey, like the old baroque buildings that dominated the city. I didn't want to see what the previous photographer had done; I wanted to make it my own. I just had to wait for the right moment to arrive.
A photograph is a moment, but you have to wait for that moment. So I took my time, looked around, and waited until I could see clearly. Then I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn, and the snow-covered streets were empty and magical. I couldn't take a perfect photo of the cathedral, but I could take something beautiful. Photography is always magical, and even when you understand how it works, you still feel a sense of wonder. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me."

The Hayward Gallery in London has been transformed into a place of wonder. Instead of a big, flashy show, it's an exhibition about kinetic art, which is art that moves or explores movement. The curator, Guy Brett, has collected many interesting pieces, including paintings, drawings, and films. The exhibition doesn't have many explanations, so visitors can explore and discover things for themselves.
David Hockney is a well-known artist, but some people don't think his work is important. However, he doesn't try to be a great artist, and he knows that only time will tell if his work is truly significant.
As a curator, I once organized an exhibition called ""Window-shopping"" where artists showed their work without any theme or concept. It was a chance for people to see different art styles and enjoy them without any expectations.
Some people think that analyzing art can ruin the experience, but this is not true. Knowing more about the art can actually make it more enjoyable. Art is not just about pleasing our senses, but also about understanding the values and culture of the society we live in.

Metals
It's possible that people in the Stone Age were interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine an early human sitting by a river, waiting for a fish to come close, and accidentally finding a shiny yellow stone. They might have thought it was attractive and kept it. This could be how gold first entered people's lives. Because gold is soft, it soon became a valuable material.
Copper might have been discovered by accident too. When people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for copper ore and ways to get the copper out of it. This led to the development of metalworking, which was an important skill for our ancestors.
St Ives
We trudged down a winding street in St Ives, our bags heavy, trying to avoid the strong wind and icy waves crashing against the promenade. The streets were empty, and all the shutters on the waterfront cottages were closed tight. We had taken the small train to St Ives and watched the weather get worse. I had promised my friend a nice time, with walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire. Computer Modelling
The problem with studying the past is that it's already happened. We can't ask people who lived in the past what they did or why they made certain choices. Archaeology can give us some clues, but we can't test our ideas by experimenting with people who are alive or dead. However, we can use computer models to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, and create virtual communities that behave like real people. We can set rules for how they live and see how they react when we change things like the weather or population.

Vervet Monkeys
In a group of vervet monkeys, the dominant male noticed a strange male trying to join their group. The stranger's intentions were clear: he wanted to take over the group and become the new leader. To stop this, the dominant male came up with a clever idea. Whenever the stranger tried to approach the group, the dominant male gave an alarm call, warning the other monkeys of a leopard nearby. The stranger would quickly retreat back to the safety of the trees.
This trick worked well until the dominant male made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while walking across the open ground himself. This time, the stranger didn't retreat.
Cats and Birds
In a village in England, people collected data on their cats' hunting habits. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 prey items. A professor calculated that if this were true for all cats in Britain, they would kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, most cats are urban and have small territories, so they don't catch as many prey as the cats in this study. The question is not how many prey cats catch, but whether their hunting is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, so the bird population remains high.
Buffalo's Day
Buffaloes are an essential part of the marshman's life. They sleep on a platform or near the fire at night. In the morning, they slowly and wearily leave the platform, groaning and complaining about the long day ahead. They stand at the edge of the water, groaning again, before finally entering the water. Once in the water, they become lethargic and may wallow there for a while. They slowly move away from the house, eventually swimming and grazing on plants in the reeds and bulrushes.
Picasso's Painting
Pablo Picasso painted a picture of a fishmonger's slab with a crab and scales containing fish.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a B2 level learner:
Photography has been used for over a century and a half to capture various aspects of human life and activity. During this time, photography has become more advanced in its ability to record time and space, allowing us to see both small and large things, as well as events from all over the world. Photography has also been an important way for people to express themselves and understand the world.
The idea of recording events through images is not new, however. People have been creating images for thousands of years, long before photography was invented. These early images were often used to tell stories, record events, or simply to make things more beautiful.
When photography was invented, it was seen as a way to automatically record what was happening, and it was considered a major achievement. The camera was thought to be like the human eye, capturing a fixed image that was very close to what we see. Because of this, people thought that everyone would be able to understand photographs, regardless of their background or culture.
However, as global communication has increased, we have come to realize that the photographic image is not always universal. Different cultures may interpret photographs differently, and the meaning of an image can depend on the context in which it is seen.
Photography has changed a lot since it was first invented, and its role in society has evolved. Today, photographs are often used to document historical events, but they can also be used to promote social and political change. For example, photographs played a major role in the Italian Renaissance, and they have helped shape the media culture of our time.

Writing Poetry and Other Forms of Creative Writing
Writing poetry is like walking through a minefield. You need to be careful and spontaneous, or you might make mistakes. Some people find it helpful to read a lot, write a lot, and let their imagination run free. Others might need to feel secure before they can write. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to writing.
In the short story, it's important to keep the story simple and focused. You shouldn't have too many characters or too much description. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story move forward. Dialogue is a good way to reveal different perspectives and keep the reader interested.
Screenwriting is similar to playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves carefully. It's not just about making individual decisions, but about seeing the big picture and understanding how everything fits together.
Language is a natural part of being human, but writing is not. Children learn language easily, but writing is more difficult. Writing systems have been invented only a few times in history, and most people don't learn to read and write easily. We need to understand how writing works and how children's minds work in order to teach them to write.

I'm not sure if I should call this book a novel. It's not a typical story with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it's a collection of my memories about a man I knew, but only at irregular intervals. I don't know what happened to him between our meetings. I could fill in the gaps with made-up stories, but I don't want to do that. I just want to tell what I know.
To protect the people involved, I've given them fictional names. I've also tried to make it clear that they are not famous or well-known. My book might only be interesting because of its own value, not because of who the people in it are.
I think my book will be useful for someone writing a biography about this man in the future. I haven't written down conversations word for word, but I have a good memory and I've tried to capture the essence of what was said. I've also taken some liberties with what people said, just like historians do, to make the story more engaging.
I'm a bit worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from a different background, as they are shaped by their upbringing, environment, and experiences. I've only written about people from my own culture before, and even then, it's been in short stories where you can leave out some details. In this book, I'm trying to be honest about how I see these people, not how they see themselves.

POETRY RECITALS
At any time in history, people often think that the literary scene is confusing. But looking back, it's clear that some poets are more famous than others. Today, there are many different types of poetry being written, and different opinions about what poetry should be. Some poets write for readers who will print and read their work, while others prefer to perform their poetry in front of an audience.
There is a debate between these two groups. The poets who write for readers think that the performing poets are not serious about their craft. The performing poets, on the other hand, think that the readers are too focused on the written word. This division is not absolute, and many poets do both.
In recent years, poetry readings have become more popular. Small groups in towns and cities hold events in community centers or private homes. Schools and universities invite poets to read to their students. Arts festivals also feature poetry readings.
The consequences of these events are not all positive. For poets who write for performance, readings are essential. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand, and they can be appreciated at a single hearing. However, on the page, their poems may not be as good.
Poets who are dedicated to their craft may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. These poets may try to make their work more accessible, which could mean writing something less good. Attending a poetry reading can be enjoyable, but it's not a substitute for reading poetry on the page. It's best to have the text in front of you or have read the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry readings is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for a select few."

Oral History
When historians use oral evidence, they need to be aware of the problems that come with it. The person giving the testimony is influenced by the historian asking the questions and the setting in which they are talking. The historian's own background and way of thinking can also affect the information they get. So, historians need to take responsibility for the way they collect their evidence.
Even when the historian is not there, the person giving the testimony may not be telling the truth. They might be influenced by what they have seen or heard from others, or they might be remembering things differently because of their own feelings or experiences. This means that historians need to be careful when using oral evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main ways to study animals: physiology and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how animals' bodies work, while those who study whole animals look at how they behave in their natural environment. Within this approach, there are two subfields: psychology and ethology. Psychologists study how animals learn and behave in labs, while ethologists study how animals behave in the wild.
Some scientists think that studying the body's functions is more important, but others believe that studying behavior is just as important. Even if we knew everything about how an animal's body works, we would still need to study its behavior to understand it fully.
The Social Sciences
When students start studying a social science, they need to do two things at once: learn about the subject and learn how to study it. Social sciences are not just common sense; they use special methods and concepts that are unique to each field.
Each social science focuses on a different aspect of society, and each uses its own methods and ideas. The basic concepts of a subject are what make it different from common sense and what allow social scientists to go beyond everyday understanding.
Classical Architecture
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building structures, but also about art and design. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He believed that utility and function were not as important as aesthetics.
The origins of classical architecture are complex, but it is clear that there was a long history of simple, practical building before the more sophisticated designs of ancient Greece and Italy. Despite their simplicity, these early buildings contributed to the development of classical architecture, and the temple, for example, is essentially a simple hut with a single room.

I told you to let me down. But I didn't think about the weight of the bucket or your lack of strength. You held the handle, and when I pushed the bucket off the side, I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange, flashing lights. It wasn't until later that I realized I had seen stars like those in cartoons.
At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what my parents would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay.

He looked at me with a serious expression, and I felt like he was seeing me for the first time. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me with a worried expression, shaking his head. He didn't believe me either. I felt ashamed and regretful.

Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, made it possible for anyone to write a book review. Anyone could give a book up to five stars and write a review. This was a great idea because it allowed readers to see what others thought of a book before buying it. But this freedom also led to some problems. Some people wrote fake reviews, either to help their own books or to hurt others. Amazon had to remove these reviews, but it was hard to catch them all.
Some authors even wrote their own fake reviews to improve their book's rating. One author, Lev Grossman, did this and then wrote an article about it. Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also leave comments on their own books, but Amazon didn't always check if they were really from the author.
The most interesting thing about the reviews on Amazon was that most people took them very seriously. They wrote thoughtful and honest reviews, and they helped others decide whether to buy a book or not. George Orwell, a famous writer, once said that writing reviews of books you don't really care about is hard. But with Amazon, anyone could write a review and help others make informed decisions.

Art in modern times is often expected to be unique, revolutionary, and shocking. We admire artists who were not appreciated in the past, but we are less tolerant of art from our own time. We expect artists to be special, with talents and drive that set them apart from the rest of us. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, and it was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and criticize them if they don't produce something extraordinary.
I'd like to describe a situation and ask a question about it. Imagine an artist chooses a text from an art book that talks about the diversity of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This is simple language and thinking, but bear with me. The artist then asks someone to create a canvas and write the chosen text on it in simple black letters. My question is: is the finished product a painting?
Artists often face pressure to stick to a successful style and genre. If they try something new, people may be upset and feel betrayed. However, some artists manage to break the mold and succeed. Eric Rimmington is an example of an artist who is now exploring a new direction by painting the London Underground. His exhibition, Underground Encounters, shows the magic of this hidden world.
In a novel, a character escapes to a remote island to heal. He is alone except for a villager who comes to clean the house. The character is neither happy nor unhappy; he is suspended in memories. He talks about the uselessness of art but also its consolations. As an artist, he finds solace in creating something that reorders reality, revealing its true meaning. For artists, there is a joyful compromise between their art and their life experiences, which helps them fulfill their potential and find meaning.

My father and I were driving back to London after a school event. He was quiet, which was unusual for him. I knew something was bothering him. ""What's wrong?"" I asked. He told me that he didn't think I would want to join the family business after I finished university. He said I had the skills and personality to be a successful lawyer, but he thought I would rather do something else. I didn't want to disappoint him, but I also didn't want to give up my own plans.
My father had always been involved in the family business, and I had grown up helping out during my school holidays. He offered to let me continue doing so until I finished university, and then I could decide if I wanted to join the business or not. I agreed, and over the next few years, I helped out occasionally.
When I was about to finish university, my father asked me to do one more important job for him. It was a big deal for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my while. I was worried about missing my exams, but I didn't want to say no to my father. He was a very driven person, and I respected him for that. In the end, I agreed to do the job.

Simon Costello knew that buying a house in Pembroke Square was a mistake soon after he and his wife Lois moved in. The house was expensive and they had to be very careful with their money. At the time, it seemed like a good idea because Simon was having a lot of successful cases and Lois was working again after having twins. She was making a good salary and they needed more space, a garden, and an au pair. But Lois wanted to live in a prestigious area, not just a suburb. She didn't want to give up her high social status.
Lois thought that one of them should take the train to work, but Simon had to do it because her office was on the other side of London. He hated his daily commute, which took 30 minutes, and spent the time thinking about how unhappy he was.
Simon's thoughts went back to his childhood, when he stayed with his grandparents in Hampstead. His grandmother was a strong supporter of his father's career and made sure he was comfortable after a long day at work. Simon felt like he and Lois were living a different kind of life now, where both partners had important careers.
Lois had always said that her career was as important as Simon's, and they needed two salaries to maintain their lifestyle. But now, their success could be ruined by Venetia, a lawyer who was angry and upset. Simon remembered their conversation and felt guilty. Venetia had accused him of not doing something important in a case four years ago, and Simon had denied it. He knew he should have said something different, but he didn't.
Simon was worried about what Venetia might do next. He didn't know what she could do, but if this got out, his career would be ruined."

I chose this place to live, thinking I would find a quiet and peaceful environment. However, people in the shops soon start to recognize me, and the gardens next door, which were once loved, are now a reminder of the beauty that is passing me by. I try to forget about the summer by staying inside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have cleared some space in my small London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.
As I'm clearing, my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, appears at the window. She's a writer and often asks me to give her feedback on her work. I have a copy of her latest manuscript, which I've been meaning to read. She invites me to come down and have a drink, but I'm not keen on having her in my garden.
As we chat, Jaz mentions that she's going on holiday, and I reveal that I'm going to visit my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun. Jaz asks me what I think of her latest book, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans"". I like the title and tell her so. She asks for my honest opinion, and I suggest that she might try writing about nice people instead of focusing on herself. She becomes defensive and accuses me of being a teacher who doesn't understand the struggles of a writer. I try to give her some advice, but she's not interested.
As we finish our conversation, I feel a sense of relief when we go back inside. My calm kitchen gives me a moment of peace, but then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to say, ""I've had my moments. We nearly died.""

**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it helps us connect with our past. We usually feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. But we also need to learn about our past to understand our individual and national futures. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, which helps us feel secure about the future. It's like inheriting genes, but also a culture passed down through generations.
Some things about our heritage might not be what we like, but it's still ours. It's reassuring to feel part of something bigger than ourselves. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being. It affects our customs, traditions, and even the things we own.
In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But with the rise of industrial society, many of these stories were lost. Today, we find clues to our past in places and buildings. It's crucial to preserve and restore these links to our ancestors' identity.
**The Fens**
I wrote a novel called Waterland, set in the Fens, a region in eastern England. People asked me why I chose this area, as I'm not from there. I chose the Fens because they seemed like an empty stage for my story. But as I learned more, I discovered the Fens are actually rich and strange. It's remarkable that this part of England is still unique and foreign to many people.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections accessible to everyone. In the past, this meant putting things in display cases with labels. Now, museums should be more engaging and interactive. They should make their collections available to a wide audience, not just display them. Museums are about more than just displays; they're about connecting people with the past.
**Architecture and Environment**
Preserving things is important, but change is inevitable. As our towns change rapidly, we need to think about what we want to preserve and how to handle change. Physical change reflects social change, so we need to learn to adapt.

Einstein is a famous scientist who is often used to advertise products that seem intelligent, like computers and encyclopedias. Many people know that he came up with some important theories, but they might not understand what they mean. These theories are called'relativity', and they changed the way scientists think about the universe.
Einstein was part of a big change in science that happened in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better by studying how things move and how they are connected. Einstein looked at the basics of the universe, like time, space, matter, and energy, and came up with new ideas.
Before Einstein, scientists thought that time and space were fixed and absolute. But Einstein said that they are not fixed, they are relative. This idea was a big change in the way scientists thought about the universe.

The writer also talks about their childhood and how they were encouraged to read by their parents. They mention that their parents would give them money to read certain books, and sometimes they would even get books with funny messages like ""This Book is NOT Literature"".

The writer also talks about the origin of human language. They quote Jacob Grimm, who said that the origin of language is a secret and amazing thing. Many people have tried to figure out where language came from, and some have come up with strange ideas. For example, one person suggested that primitive humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. Some languages have words that are related to these sounds, like the word ""malaria"" which means ""fever"".
Recently, scientists have been studying the origin of language and how it has evolved. They think that language probably developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. At first, language was used for friendly interactions and for power struggles. It was not just used for sharing information, as some people thought.

Writing Reviews: A Reviewer's Perspective
Frank Kermode, a reviewer, shares his thoughts on the craft of writing reviews. Most reviews have a short lifespan because they are written under tight deadlines and are only published for a short time. People often think that reviewing is not a valuable activity, but Kermode argues that it requires skill and expertise.
Reviewing is not just about summarizing a book in a few hundred words. It requires the ability to control one's arguments and write clearly, even when writing about complex topics. The reviewer must also consider the audience, whether it's someone who just wants a quick summary or someone who wants a more in-depth analysis.
A reviewer needs to have a broad range of knowledge and be able to write in a way that is easy to understand. Many reviewers also write other types of content, such as novels or academic papers. The American novelist John Updike, for example, writes reviews in his free time.
Some people might think that reviewers should accept that their work is temporary and not try to make it last. However, Kermode believes that reviewers should be allowed to keep their work and enjoy the recognition it brings. He himself has written many reviews and considers them an important part of his work.
In the English-speaking world, it is common for academics to write reviews, and this is seen as a way for them to share their expertise with a wider audience. Kermode believes that this arrangement is beneficial for both readers and academics, as it ensures that reviews are well-written and informative. It also reminds academics of the importance of communicating their ideas clearly to non-experts.
Overall, Kermode argues that reviewing is a valuable activity that requires skill and expertise. While it may not be the most prestigious job, it is an important way for academics and writers to share their knowledge with others."

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a B2 level learner:
Ralph returned home to his flat, feeling a familiar sense of ownership. Even after three years, he still got this feeling sometimes when he came back alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he was excited to come home and see what had happened while he was away. He thought about what it would be like if someone had broken in or if there were problems with the pipes. But his flat was always just as he left it, either tidy or messy. Over time, he started to think of it as his own little world, a place where he could be himself.
Ralph sometimes felt impatient with his flat because it never changed. He would find letters and messages on the doorstep, and the answering machine would be blinking. He was grateful that nothing was broken or damaged. Ralph often looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the busy office. When he was on his own, he didn't need anyone else. But when he was at his desk, he felt the need for solitude and time to himself.
Ralph often felt lost and empty, like he was searching for himself. He would read or listen to music, but sometimes he wondered who he was doing it for. He had lost his sense of direction and his ideas seemed to get stuck in his mind. Ralph used to think he knew what he wanted, but now he wasn't so sure. He had followed a path without really thinking about it, and now he felt like he was just trying to survive.
Ralph had tried to plan his future after university, but he didn't have much ambition. He took a job at a local newspaper, which seemed like a good opportunity at the time. His boss, Neil, offered him the job on the spot, and Ralph didn't think to ask any questions. He was relieved to have gotten the job, but now he was stuck in a routine that didn't make him happy."

Some activities cannot be rushed. For example, if you're making mayonnaise, you need to add the oil slowly or it will curdle. If you're fishing, if you pull too hard on the line, the knot will get tighter. Our minds work at different speeds too. Some things happen quickly, while others take longer. We can speed up some processes, like solving puzzles or doing mental math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to rush them, they will break down.
Our minds have different ways of thinking and learning. Some things we do quickly, without thinking, like reacting to a sudden situation. Other things we think about carefully, like solving a problem or making a decision. And then there are times when we just let our minds wander, daydreaming or relaxing. This slower way of thinking is important too. It helps us make sense of complex things, come up with new ideas, and solve difficult problems.
Scientists have recently discovered that our slower, more relaxed thinking can do many things that our conscious minds cannot. It can learn patterns that are too subtle for us to see, make sense of complicated situations, and solve problems that are hard to figure out. This is important to remember, as we often try to rush through our thinking and decision-making. Giving our minds time to wander and reflect can be just as important as using our quick thinking and problem-solving skills.

Surviving in a Foreign Land
I've been welcomed warmly to a small community of about 40 people, including scientists, students, and weather forecasters. We all live and work together, and everyone helps each other. My basic French is enough to communicate, but I struggle to have a conversation or make small talk. I miss the nuances of language and often feel lost at breakfast.

He thought that a film can evoke the same emotions in people from different cultures, as long as it is well-made. Hitchcock was a perfectionist who focused on the technical aspects of filmmaking, and he wanted his audiences to be scared or moved by his movies."

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. Until 30 years ago, there were few charts and books about astronomy. Now, you can buy telescopes and equipment easily.

Instead of buying a chocolate mousse full of preservatives, you can make your own in just a few minutes. Cooking is a way to show love and care, and sharing food is a powerful symbol of our deepest human needs. That's why we often celebrate special occasions around the table.

Dr. Johnson said that writing without effort is usually not enjoyable to read. He believed that good writing requires a lot of effort. When I look back at my old handwritten essays, I'm surprised to see how few corrections I made. Today, I would probably rewrite them five times over. I think this is because writing by hand is physically demanding and requires more attention.
The slowness of handwriting helps to discipline the brain and makes us more careful with our words. In contrast, typing on a computer can be too easy and fast, leading to careless mistakes. Many writers who use word processors spend as much time correcting their work as they would if they had written it by hand.

'England's Breakfast Revolution
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is essential, but in the past, breakfast was not a common meal in England. In medieval times, there were no mentions of breakfast in literature. However, there were some exceptions. Travellers would sometimes eat before a long journey, and the sick would have breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were rich or royal.
In the 16th century, things changed. Breakfast became a normal part of daily life. Some people think that this was because food became more widely available. But others believe that there were deeper social changes that contributed to the importance of breakfast. For example, as people started working regular hours, they needed to eat a meal in the morning to give them energy. This was not just for the wealthy or noble anymore, but for everyone. Having breakfast became a necessity, not just a sign of social status.'

Birds have always been an important part of human culture. We have a lot of different feelings about them, from loving them to being afraid of them. But what does this say about us? 
In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could predict their luck. Today, wrens are often found in pictures and ceramics in British homes. The wren is a special bird that holds a special place in our culture and our hearts. A forest without wrens is a sad and empty place.
People have a deep connection with birds that goes back to a time when we were more connected to nature. We developed a way of talking about birds that is different from science. This way of talking is based on stories, legends, and rhymes that have been passed down through generations.
For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed them bread. But soon, people started to see them as pests and they almost became extinct. Now, they are protected and being reintroduced to their natural habitats.
Our relationship with birds is not just about culture, but about who we are as humans. We are fascinated by birds because they can fly, sing, and are free. This fascination is a way for us to understand ourselves and our place in the natural world.
Birds have become important indicators of environmental change. Many species are endangered, which is not only a loss for the environment, but also a loss of cultural heritage. The skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are just a few examples of birds that hold special meaning in literature and folklore.
The stories and legends about birds are important because they connect us to the natural world in a way that science can't. They evoke feelings and emotions that are hard to put into words. The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past, and the mystery of the natural world.

Maps help us understand the relationships between places and features on the Earth's surface. Two important elements are distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, such as 'a day's journey by river'. However, this method didn't provide accurate information about actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, it was more important to know where to go and how far it was, rather than the exact direction.
For a long time, written itineraries were used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing railway systems, may not show accurate directions. Landmarks along a route were initially indicated by signs, which varied in size to show their importance. The conventions used on maps varied depending on their purpose and location, so it's essential to understand the specific convention used on an old map.
The history of cartography is the story of how we've improved our ability to measure distance and direction, and how we've included more information on maps. Cartographers have borrowed ideas from other sciences, such as astronomy and geology, to improve their work. For example, they used the magnetic compass to determine direction and developed instruments to calculate angles accurately.
As people's needs changed, so did the demands on mapmakers. Travelers, soldiers, and scientists all needed different types of maps, which led to the development of new techniques and technologies. Today, cartographers create maps for a wide range of purposes, from showing geological formations to land use.
The study of historical cartography is fascinating because it shows how maps have evolved over time and how they reflect human knowledge and technology. Maps are a valuable record of the past, and understanding them can help us learn about the people who created them."

I was amazed by his extensive record collection, the first stereo player I had ever seen, and the fact that a teenager had bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. Andrew was a talented composer who had won a scholarship to Oxford University to study history. He wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers, and I wanted to be a pop star. We both had big ambitions, but mine were not as all-consuming as his.

I would continue to look for opportunities to sing with bands and write more songs. But I was still excited to work with Andrew and see where it would take us.

Language
We humans have a special ability - we can communicate with each other using language. It's so important that we can't imagine life without it. When we're with other people, we usually talk to each other. Even when we're alone, we might talk to ourselves, our pets, or even plants! I like to think of language as an instinct, like how spiders know how to spin webs. It's not something we need to learn, but rather something we naturally know how to do.
Climate and Weather
The air around us affects the lives of animals and plants. The climate can change the way a place looks. For example, warm and wet weather allows tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things. The weather is caused by big movements of air in the atmosphere. The Earth is spinning, and the air moves with it, but not at the same speed. The sun also affects the air, making it move.

As a bar-person, I had to learn how to make coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant's coffee is very important. I had to learn how to clean and maintain the espresso machine, and how to make the perfect cup of cappuccino. It took me a while to get it right, but my boss was patient and told me that making good coffee is both an art and a science. It takes time to get the hang of it.

""Art on TV: Why is it that TV shows about art are often disappointing? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for TV because the camera can show the whole work of art and then zoom in on the details. However, I can't think of many TV shows that successfully convey the pleasure and complexity of looking at art. A good example of what goes wrong is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, American Visions. Hughes is a well-known art critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British audiences to a school of American art that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks. Instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
In my past work as a metals dealer, I learned that metals are less regulated than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it's possible to make a lot of money. However, the free-trade economists who claimed that the market would maintain the price of scarce metals were wrong. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. In fact, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago.
Recently, I was asked to investigate allegations against one of the multinational companies that benefit from these cheap raw materials.
Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. Each island has its own unique character, and each has something special to offer. To get around the islands, you can use a boat, take a ferry, or rent one. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here, and Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a reason. The calm waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkelling, and swimming. The beaches stretch for 200 miles, and at night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle.""

Self-help books have become very popular in the US. A book by Dr. John Gray, a psychologist, became a huge success and made him a millionaire. The book helps people understand each other better, especially between men and women. The self-help industry is a big business that makes a lot of money. Many books are published, but not all of them are good. Some are just trying to make money and are not helpful.
When publishing a self-help book, editors look for something that will sell well. They want to know if the author is popular and if the book has a catchy title. The book should be easy to understand and appeal to many people.
Autobiographies are books about someone's life written by that person. Sometimes, the writer might not tell the truth because they are ashamed of something or think it's not important. They might also make up stories to make their book more interesting. The reader might not realize this and think the book is true.
Detective stories are popular too. They are like a puzzle that the reader tries to solve. The story is often about a crime and the detective who solves it. The crime is usually a symbol of something that people struggle with, like greed or lust. The detective is like a symbol of the struggle between good and bad.
Science writing is another popular genre. Stephen Jay Gould is a well-known science writer. He believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the culture and rules of science. He also thinks that writers should not simplify their language or ideas too much. They should be honest and straightforward in their writing.

Air-conditioning at Cannons Gym
Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, has turned up the air-conditioning to cope with the hot summer weather. It's so cold that it feels like being in the Arctic!

Sundials
It's interesting that people are showing more interest in sundials again. These ancient devices measure time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping accurate time. Now, they're being taken seriously again. Sundial maker David Harber believes their appeal lies in their connection to the planets. He says it's magical to see one working for the first time. Sundials are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for a B2 level learner:
Keith and Dawne booked a package holiday to Venice, but something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel in Switzerland instead. They had given their tickets to a girl at the travel agency, who had checked the details and said everything was fine. However, when they arrived at the airport, they noticed that the other passengers were a group of elderly people from the south coast, all learning Italian. Keith and Dawne were confused and thought maybe there had been a cancellation or a mistake.
When they arrived at the hotel, they were given a room and told that they would be staying there for 12 nights. They were surprised because they had booked a holiday in Venice, not Switzerland. They tried to explain the situation to the hotel receptionist, but he didn't seem to understand. They even met the woman who had been on the plane with them, Mrs. Franks, who explained that Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to different destinations and prices. She said that all tickets and labels are similar, and it's easy to get confused.
Keith and Dawne were frustrated and felt like they had been misled. They tried to think back to every step of their journey, from handing over their tickets to getting on the plane. They realized that they had followed the wrong group, and that's why they ended up in the wrong place. They were disappointed and felt like they had wasted their holiday.

Ernest Shackleton, a famous polar explorer, is being studied by American business leaders as a model of good management. Many people in the UK know who Shackleton was and what he did, but in the US, he was largely unknown until recently. Now, his story is being told and retold in books, films, and exhibitions.
Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model, looking for lessons in leadership and communication. They see him as a leader who was determined, resourceful, and able to stay calm in difficult situations. Shackleton's ability to make tough decisions, such as turning back from the South Pole when it was 97 miles away, is seen as an example of his leadership skills.
Shackleton's leadership style is also admired for his ability to communicate effectively with his team. He kept his men informed and involved in decision-making, which helped to build trust and motivation. His approach is seen as relevant to modern business, where leaders need to be able to communicate clearly and make difficult decisions.
Shackleton's story is also seen as a reminder of the importance of perseverance, optimism, and adaptability. He believed that an explorer needs to have these qualities to succeed, and these qualities are also valuable in business. As one manager put it, ""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men informed, and was willing to adapt when things didn't go as planned.""
Shackleton's story is inspiring because it shows that even in difficult situations, it is possible to stay positive and focused on the goal. His leadership style and approach to decision-making are seen as relevant to modern business, and his story is being used to teach managers about the importance of communication, teamwork, and adaptability."

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a rare and unusual primate called the aye-aye. It has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by drilling into wood. The aye-aye uses its teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin finger to search for food. Scientists have been studying the aye-aye's hunting skills and have discovered how it finds the insects inside the wood.
Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University's Primate Center has been working with a few aye-ayes in captivity. He wanted to know if they could find insects just by looking for signs of their presence on the surface of the wood. He presented the aye-ayes with logs with holes drilled into them. Some holes had mealworms inside, while others were empty. The aye-ayes easily found the mealworms, even without looking for visual signs. They must have been using another way to find the insects.
Dr. Erickson tried to figure out how the aye-ayes were doing it. He discovered that they could find empty cavities as well as ones with mealworms. This meant they must be sensing the cavity itself. When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and moves its large ears forward, focusing them in front of its nose. Dr. Erickson thinks that the aye-aye is using a special way of listening and feeling for the reverberations of the taps, which indicate a hollow space below. It might also hear the insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.
The aye-aye's ability to find food in wood is similar to that of woodpeckers, but there are other birds that also search for insects in wood. The aye-aye's unique features, such as its continuously growing incisors and ability to gnaw through shells, make it a fascinating animal."

Most people have photos of their grandparents, but few know what their lives were like when they were young. We often intend to write down our own stories, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes biographies of ordinary people, creating a book of at least 20,000 words with pictures if needed. This idea came to her when she talked to her family members and realized how much of the past was disappearing. She started writing other people's stories because she met people who were willing to share their experiences and enjoyed talking about them.
Ms. Renier's subjects feel comfortable opening up because they know their stories will be kept confidential. One of her subjects, a 62-year-old man, said he was surprised by what came out. He talked about his divorce and the pain it still brought him. He did it for his family, but hasn't shown it to his children yet because they were hurt by some of the things he shared.
Ms. Renier has noticed that many people's childhood experiences shape their lives. People often repeat patterns they learned from their parents, even as adults. They may marry someone their parents approved of or go in the opposite direction as a rebellion. Many people still regret or resent things from their past, even decades later.
Ms. Renier's approach is different from traditional biography writing. She keeps a distance and doesn't try to pry into people's lives. She records up to 30 hours of interviews and uses them to write the life story, rearranging the events and interpreting them. The final product is a high-quality book with a price tag of nearly £3,000. While not cheap, Ms. Renier receives about 10 inquiries a week, mostly from people who are willing to pay for a well-written and professional biography.
The people Ms. Renier works with are often from a higher social class and are used to having their stories told. They are willing to pay for a high-quality product that will be treasured by their families."

I have been a father for 35 years, and I can honestly say I've loved every minute of it. I've been lucky to have children who share my interests, such as opera, theatre, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they're grown up and we've become friends rather than just parent and child.
I'm not perfect, and I've made mistakes. I've slapped my children in anger, but I don't condone physical violence. I've always tried to be available for them, and I'm here for them whenever they need me.
I was young when my children were born, and it was challenging to balance work and family life. But it's also kept me young and given me a sense of purpose. As they grew older, they introduced me to new things, like music and fashion, which has been valuable in my career.
**The Advertising Executive**
I was 25 when my children were born, and it was a big change for me. I felt old and tired, but it also kept me young. As they grew older, they showed me things I might have missed, like concerts and sports days.

'The Science of Weightlessness: A Unique Flight Experience
Journalist Tom Mumford joined a group of students on a special flight to test their scientific theories in weightless conditions. The plane, a Boeing KC-135, was converted to create a unique environment for the students to conduct their experiments. The students from Europe and America had won a competition to participate in this extraordinary flight, which was offered by the European Space Agency.
The plane took off smoothly, but the students soon realized that this was no ordinary flight. The pilot put the plane into a steep climb, and the engines roared loudly. The students felt their bodies being pressed into their seats, and then suddenly, the engines stopped, and the plane was weightless. For a few seconds, the students felt like they were floating in mid-air.
The students had 30 minutes to conduct their experiments in weightlessness. Some of them tested how objects move in zero gravity, while others studied how materials behave without gravity. One group even tested a robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how it would move in space. Another team investigated how to create solar sails that could use the sun's radiation to propel spacecraft.
The flight was an exhilarating experience for the students, who felt like they were on a rollercoaster ride. They were thrilled to have had the opportunity to experience weightlessness and to conduct their experiments in such a unique environment. As one student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience.

I had an unusual experience when I didn't have any summers for a while. I would go to New Zealand every summer, which is their winter, and I had nine winters in a row. My parents suggested that my brother, sister, and I take care of a small plot of land and plant trees on it. If we could take the time to plant the trees, we could have the land. The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, as my father was born there.
The land was not very good for farming, but it was perfect for planting trees. I had worked on sheep stations in Australia before, so I was excited to plant trees. The rest of the family became enthusiastic as we started planting. We planted the 70 acres of land over four years, from 1968 to 1972. It was a challenging time, as it rained almost every day. But we enjoyed the process, and it was a great experience.
I had a friend who was an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful for me. We would fill bags with trees and then plant them along a line. It was hard work, but it made me fit. After a while, we got into a rhythm and could plant trees quickly and easily. The process was mentally interesting, and I started to think about the natural world and our place in it.
I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and have watched the trees grow. It's been satisfying to see how well they've done. I sometimes worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but overall, it was a successful project. I even wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" while I was there. The connection I feel to that place is still strong, and it's a powerful bond between people and the earth."

We turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago. We've helped many orphaned animals, but the latest ones were a surprise. A helper brought us a cardboard box with three small grey badger cubs inside. They were only eight inches long and had milky-coloured eyes. We had never seen badger cubs before. The mother had been killed, and the babies were cold and hungry. We took them in and fed them with a syringe, mimicking the mother's licking. After a few days, they started drinking from a bottle and moving around. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.
As they grew, we noticed that Willow seemed sick, but we didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late. He died from a lung infection. We were sad, but we continued to care for the other two. A few days later, a local farmer found another male cub, and we named him Willow II. He was smaller and harder to feed than the others. It took him a while to get used to eating solid food, but eventually, he learned.
As the summer went on, the cubs grew and became more active. They started going on walks at night, and we would join them in the cider orchard. They would chase each other and even us, but we learned to avoid their playful attacks. As they got bigger, we noticed that other badgers were visiting our field, probably looking for food. We were warned that they might attack our cubs, so we put up a fence to keep them out.
The local press took pictures of us with the cubs, and people were so interested that we started an appeal to build a badger sett for them. We designed and built a special home with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. The cubs explored it before going on their walks, and eventually, they forgot about their walks and just enjoyed their new home.
In the end, we built a special home for the badgers, and they moved in. We would visit them occasionally, and they would still come to say hello. This is their territory now, and they have come to know it well."

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to recreate a historic voyage made by Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer, to chart the variations of the compass. Halley's journey took him across the Atlantic Ocean in the 17th century. He was trying to find the difference between magnetic north and true north, which was important for navigation.
Halley's voyage was a groundbreaking achievement. He was one of the first scientists to conduct research at sea, and his findings were crucial for sailors to navigate the oceans accurately. Unfortunately, his initial trip was cut short due to crew insubordination, but he returned to the seas and completed his mission.
To commemorate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey, Dr. Clark plans to recreate the voyage. He wants to update the measurements made by Halley and provide more accurate data for navigation. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have offered to supply instruments for the expedition.
Dr. Clark is a keen sailor and has spent time in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. He is fascinated by Halley's achievements and wants to give him the recognition he deserves. Dr. Clark believes that the expedition will not only be a tribute to Halley but also provide valuable scientific data.
The expedition will take four stages, with four different crews, and will cover over 13,000 kilometers. Dr. Clark is willing to spend eight months at sea to complete the journey. He hopes that his measurements will help to refine the model of the Earth's magnetic field and provide a better understanding of the changes in the magnetic field.

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This has puzzled scientists for a long time. How do peacocks get away with having such an extravagant feature in a world where nature is competitive? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are trying to find the answer.
Charles Darwin believed that living creatures evolved over time through a process called natural selection. This means that the individuals best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and have offspring. However, the peacock's tail doesn't seem to be useful for survival. Darwin thought that females liked the peacocks' tails because of their beauty, but his friend Alfred Russel Wallace disagreed. He believed that the hens must be choosing the males with the best tails because they have some other quality that is not obvious to humans.
For a long time, scientists have tried to study the behavior of peafowl, but it's difficult. However, the 200 birds at Whipsnade offer a unique opportunity to observe them. Marion Petrie and her team have identified two main questions: Do hens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? And do the peacocks with the most impressive tails have some advantage that helps them survive?
The team has observed that hens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. However, it's not clear whether these males are also healthier or stronger. The team is now studying the offspring of the attractive and unattractive males to see if there are any differences.
There is also a theory that showy male birds are less likely to have parasites, and their bright plumage advertises their health. However, the team has not been able to test this theory in the Whipsnade peacocks.
In the past, a mathematician and biologist named R A Fisher proposed an idea called 'Fisher's Runaway'. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit their father's tail and their daughters will inherit their mother's preference for long tails. This could create a feedback loop where the males with the longest tails get more mates and leave more offspring, and the females' preference for long tails increases over time. This theory could explain why peacocks have such long tails.
This theory also vindicates Darwin's idea that females might choose males for their beauty, even if it doesn't seem useful for survival."

MY DREAM BOAT I believe that the best boat design combines old and new ideas. I built my own boat, 'The Westerman', using traditional methods, but with modern technology. It's not like the fancy yachts at the London Boat Show, which are all about new technology. My boat looks old, but it's actually a modern design. I wanted to create a boat that is both functional and beautiful.
I've always believed that a boat should be a boat, not a floating house. I've had many boats in the past, but my favorite was an old boat called Hirta. She was simple, with no fancy electronics or modern comforts. But she was easy to sail and taught me a lot about the sea.
When I was injured, I had to sell Hirta, but I couldn't find a new boat that I liked. So, I decided to build a new one from scratch. I worked with a designer, Nigel Irens, who used computer software to help us create the design. We made a model of the boat and tested it before building it.
The result is 'The Westerman', a boat that is both beautiful and functional. She's sailed across the Atlantic and has won several races. I'm very proud of her. I think she's proof that you don't need the latest technology to have a great boat. Sometimes, it's better to go back to traditional methods and listen to the wisdom of the past.

Humanity and animals are more similar than we think. In fact, we are 98% genetically identical to chimpanzees, our closest relatives. This means that any differences between us and animals must be due to a small number of genes. Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use tools, and some animals even have their own languages.
The only thing that really sets us apart from animals is art. But why did humans develop art so recently, considering we've been around for millions of years? The earliest evidence of human art dates back to around 35,000 years ago, in the form of cave paintings, statues, and jewelry. What makes human art different from animal art? Three main differences are often cited: human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure, and it's transmitted through learning rather than genetics.
Let's examine these claims. While human art may not serve a practical purpose, it does communicate something to others. In contrast, animal behaviors, like birdsong, serve a specific function. As for aesthetic pleasure, it's hard to know whether animals enjoy the beauty of their songs, but they do sing mainly during the breeding season, suggesting it may serve a purpose.
The third claim is that human art is learned, rather than instinctive. While humans can learn different art styles, some animals inherit their songs or behaviors. The speed at which human art styles change is also unique, unlike animal behaviors that remain relatively constant.
However, a study of chimpanzees painting art challenges these distinctions. In the 1950s, two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, created art for their own satisfaction, and some of their paintings even sold at an art show. This raises questions about what makes human art truly unique. While human artists may intend to communicate through their art, the chimpanzees' indifference to communicating with others doesn't necessarily mean their art is any less meaningful."

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It's also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. There aren't many big adventures left, and even fewer heroes. I thought I wouldn't find any real-life heroes, but then I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. It's a very challenging place, and the local people call it the Desert of Death. He told me about the dangers and excitement of the journey in a calm atmosphere at his family home.
The team he led had four British people, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The handlers had never worked with camels before, but they were long-distance truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous.
The team set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's harshest desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating book about their journey. He had just left the Army after 14 years and wanted to try something new. He wanted to prove to himself that he could do it.
Tina, his wife, was worried that he wouldn't come back because nobody had done that route before. It took them 59 days to cross the desert, and it was very kind to them. But they still faced many challenges: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and dehydration.
Blackmore explains that they were at their limits when they found some water. They didn't experience the famous sandstorms or the freezing cold that could have stopped them. But they still had many problems: sand got into their blisters and wounds, and climbing the high dunes was very difficult.
What kept him going was the need to survive. They had no backup plan, and no aircraft flew over them once they entered the sandhills. He was scared of his physical ability to complete the journey, but he knew he had the mental strength.
When they finished, they were very tired but proud of what they had achieved. Blackmore says that he is proud of this expedition more than anything else he has done. He still thinks about the desert and the sense of purpose they had.
Now, Blackmore misses the challenge and the freedom of the desert. He finds it hard to be part of modern life, which is too uniform for him."

I used to rely heavily on technology, but recently I've started to disconnect from it and enjoy manual work. Technology has made our lives easier, but it's also made us dependent on it. I had a frustrating experience with my malfunctioning word processor, which made me realize that gadgets can be a hassle. I've started to get rid of some of our household technology as it breaks down, and I've discovered the joys of doing things by hand.
I've found that sewing by hand is a great way to relax and be productive at the same time. I can listen to the radio or talk to family and friends while I sew. It's also nice to have a cup of tea and sit by the fire while I work. I used to think that sewing by hand was a tedious and time-consuming task, but I've found that it's actually quite enjoyable.
I've also started to question whether we really need all the modern appliances we have. Do we really need a freezer, a microwave oven, or a powered lawnmower? We could save money and simplify our lives by doing without some of these gadgets.
I've started to appreciate the simple things in life, like washing up by hand and taking the time to enjoy a quiet moment. I've realized that technology can be a curse as well as a blessing, and I'm glad I've taken the time to rediscover the joys of manual labour."

'People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. It's clear that sleep is important, but what exactly it does is still a topic of debate. Scientists have different opinions about why we spend so much time sleeping. There are three main theories. One theory suggests that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. It says that while we sleep, our bodies repair any damage from the day and get ready for the next day. Another theory believes that sleep helps us learn new things. It claims that without sleep, we wouldn't be able to process the information we get during the day. The third theory says that sleep helps us recharge our energy levels, so we have enough energy for the next day.'

What does it mean to be an eccentric? An eccentric is someone who behaves in a way that is different from what is considered normal in their society. But what is normal, really? We all have our own quirks and things that make us different. For example, some people love entering competitions, collecting unusual items, or writing letters to the newspaper about things that bother them. Being eccentric is about being true to ourselves and our individuality.
Most of us have a mix of two forces inside us: the desire to be like everyone else and the desire to be different. The desire to fit in and be accepted is usually stronger. That's why people who have unusual hobbies or opinions often join groups of others who share their interests. This way, they can be themselves and feel accepted.
We all have this struggle between being like everyone else and being our own person. We might pretend to fit in, but deep down, we want to be different. Some people, like famous singers or artists, have become successful by being true to themselves and their individuality.
But being eccentric is not just about doing something unusual. It's about being natural and genuine. Eccentrics don't try to be odd; they just are. They don't worry about what others think of them. They do what they do because it's who they are.
This is different from people who do unusual things to get attention or to rebel against society. Eccentrics are not aware of the world around them; they just do what they do because it feels natural to them."

We asked four naturalists to tell us about the book that has had the greatest influence on them. I, Geoffrey Lean, had the chance to meet some of the pioneers in the field. One of them was Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was at the heart of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She wrote many important books, but one that stands out to me is ""The Home of Man"". It's a classic book that talks about the growth of cities and how we can live in harmony with nature.
Linda Bennett chose ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen. This book is about animal communication and is full of interesting facts and pictures. It shows how animals work together in colonies and how they communicate with each other.
Lee Durrell's favorite book is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book is a memoir about his family's adventures with animals. It's a heartwarming story that made Lee realize how important it is to care for the natural world.
Bruce Pearson chose ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher. This book is a comprehensive guide to birds, with beautiful paintings by Eric Ennion. It's a book that inspired Bruce to appreciate birds not just as objects of study, but as a source of inspiration for art and literature.
Each of these books has had a profound impact on the naturalists who chose them. They have inspired them to appreciate the natural world and to work towards a more sustainable future."

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of book reviews on their commercial success. Here's what they said:
Publisher A: Reviews are very important for us. In fact, a survey found that many readers choose a book based on reviews more than any other factor. Authors are also affected by reviews, but publishers are more concerned with the number of words written about the book rather than the content.
Publisher B: Publishers and the press have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to promote their books. Reviews are important, but they should be balanced and varied. Unfortunately, some books, especially paperbacks, often don't get the attention they deserve.
Publisher C: Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Without them, we wouldn't be able to reach readers. We publish books by authors who aren't well-known, so we need reviews to get the word out. Good reviews can be very effective in selling books, especially if they come from respected reviewers.
Publisher D: The relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK is complex. In the US, a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, it's harder to predict how reviews will affect sales. Sometimes, even badly reviewed books become bestsellers.
Publisher E: Everyone wants long, positive reviews, but do they really sell books? I published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn't do well. People thought they could learn everything they needed to know from the reviews and didn't need to buy the book. The name of the reviewer can still influence people's decisions, but it's not as important as it used to be.

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, had a successful book called The Horse Whisperer. Even before it was published, people were excited about it. The book was his first novel and it earned him a lot of money. Evans talked to us about his inspiration and his success.
At the beginning of the year, Evans had a difficult time. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about his bank account. He had no income for two years and was struggling to pay his bills. Instead of getting a job, Evans decided to take a risk and go to America to research his first novel. He had always been interested in horses and had met a farrier who told him about a ""horse whisperer"" who could calm down aggressive horses. Evans was fascinated and started researching the subject.
He spent three months in the US, visiting horse ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. It was a challenging time for him, as he was alone and struggling to make ends meet. He had tried to make a living as a filmmaker for ten years, but it wasn't working out. He was in debt and worried about how he would feed his family.
After returning home, Evans wrote the first half of his book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent, and he liked it. The agent thought Evans could get $30,000 as an advance on the book. Evans needed more money to pay off his debts and keep his family going, so he was hesitant. He decided to write a summary of the rest of the book and sent it to seven UK publishers.
The response was overwhelming. Within a week, he received an offer of $75,000, and soon after, the book was sold to two major publishers for record-breaking advances. Evans was amazed and couldn't believe his luck. The book became a huge success, and soon, Hollywood studios were fighting over the rights to turn it into a film.
Evans decided not to write the screenplay himself, as he wanted to maintain his independence. He was happy with the success of his book and was considering writing another one."

Bobby Fischer is back in the chess world after 20 years. He's 49 years old and playing against his old rival Boris Spassky. Fischer's first game was impressive, but he's not the same player he was 20 years ago. He's out of practice and not as fit as he used to be. Spassky is also older. The game of chess has changed a lot since Fischer's time. Today, chess is more about winning than about being a genius. Players need to be good at math, memory, and strategy, but they also need to be able to handle the pressure. The game is getting longer and more intense, and players need to be able to focus for hours.
Young players are doing better than older ones because they are more used to the pressure. Most of the top players are under 30 years old. The way players prepare for a game has also changed. They use computers to study their opponents' moves and look for weaknesses. This makes it harder for older players to compete.
Playing chess is not just about being smart; it's also about being physically fit. A game can last for hours, and players need to be able to concentrate for a long time. The pressure is intense, and players need to be able to handle it. Losing is not an option, and winning brings a lot of satisfaction.
Bobby Fischer is back to prove he's still the best, but it's a tough challenge. He's older and out of practice, and the game has changed a lot. Whatever happens, he'll get a lot of money, but it might not be enough to make up for the physical and mental exhaustion of playing at the top level."

Volunteer Tourism: Is it Really Helping?
A. When people travel to help others abroad, it's hard to say if they're actually making a big difference. While they might build homes or schools, they often pay a lot of money to do it. This means that if they just donated the money, it could help more people than the volunteer could. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who don't need special skills or experience. Some people wonder if they're really helping or just trying to look good for their careers.
B. Volunteering can bring people together and help solve problems. It can also help people participate in global issues and build connections with others. This can be good for everyone involved. However, if only wealthy people from rich countries volunteer, it might not help those who need it most. The volunteers will get benefits, but the host communities won't.
C. International volunteering can be good or bad. It can be a way for wealthy Westerners to help others, but it can also be a way for them to help themselves. At its best, volunteering brings benefits to both the volunteers and the host communities. It can also raise awareness about unfair power relationships and help people understand the root causes of poverty and inequality.
D. Volunteer tourism seems to fit with the idea of ""making a difference"" in a simple way. It bypasses big government and business, which can be seen as positive. However, it also avoids the need for real change and can make people think that helping others is just about individual acts of charity. This can be a problem when volunteer tourism is marketed as a way to solve big development problems. It's important to remember that volunteering should be about making a real difference, not just looking good.

Waking Up to Music
Many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need a little help to get out of bed. That's where clock radios come in. But how do you choose the right one? Our panel, consisting of myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different models.
We looked at the ""dual alarm function"" on one model, which allows you to set two different wake-up times for work days and weekends. However, this feature is not as useful as it seems, as it only allows you to set two different times, not to wake up and then snooze and wake up again.
One model stood out for its quality radio and built-in cassette player. You can fall asleep listening to your favorite music and wake up to a gentle alarm. The radio quality is excellent, but the clock radio itself is quite large.
Another model was voted the best overall winner. Paul Bridges loved its digital display and wide snooze bar, which makes it easy to silence the alarm without opening your eyes. The clock also has a self-power backup, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out.
However, some of us found the model's design to be a bit tacky, and the instructions were difficult to follow. Tom Granger thought the built-in lamp was unnecessary and hard to position.
We also tested a model that is popular among young people, with its brightly colored casing and matching strap. It's easy to set up and has a traditional design that makes it easy to use. However, the alarm can be a bit unreliable, and the manual notes that it may sound 10-20 minutes earlier or later than the set time.
Finally, we tested the simplest and cheapest model, which has old-fashioned dial tuning. Tom Granger liked it because it's easy to use and takes up little space. However, the radio quality is not as good as some of the other models, and the tuning is a bit crude.
Overall, choosing the right clock radio depends on your personal preferences and needs."

'Hedgehogs are small mammals covered in sharp spines. They can be found in many parts of the world, except in America and Australia. One special feature of hedgehogs is that they can curl up into a ball when they feel threatened, with their spines pointing outwards. This helps protect them from predators. The effectiveness of this defence depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines and are more likely to try to run away from danger. They only roll into a ball as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep a lot during the day, often hiding in bushes or underground holes. Although hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them choose to do so. In suitable conditions, some hedgehogs stay awake all year round.'

I was 18 years old and traveling around Europe and Morocco in a old van. I was running out of money, so I took a job painting boats on the waterfront in Cannes. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in the harbour. He was an 80-year-old man, but he was still very recognizable. I was amazed to see him, as he was known to be a private person who rarely went out in public.
I had a sketchbook with me, and I decided to approach him and ask for his signature. To my surprise, he agreed. He even drew a beautiful design on the page. I was so happy that I started talking to him and told him about my love of art and my admiration for his work. An American woman at the table acted as our interpreter, as Picasso's English was limited.
After lunch, my friend suggested that I should ask Picasso if I could draw his portrait. I was nervous, but I decided to go back and ask. Picasso agreed, and I started drawing. He was a bit mischievous and acted out different expressions, making it difficult for me to draw him. But I persisted, and he eventually relaxed and let me study him. I was struck by his youthful appearance, despite his age, and his piercing eyes.
When I finished the drawing, Picasso looked at it and nodded. Then, to my surprise, he took the crayon and drew a portrait of me. His drawing was much better than mine, and I was amazed. He handed the sketchbook back to me, and I thanked him. I asked him to sign the drawing, but he said I already had his signature. I was grateful for the experience and felt lucky to have met Picasso.

**How Shops Make You Spend More**
Have you ever gone to a store and ended up buying more than you planned? Shops use many tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:
**A. Fresh and Clean**
Supermarkets know that customers like to buy fresh food. That's why they often put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance of the store. They may also have a bakery that makes the store smell like fresh bread. The color of the store can also make it feel fresher.
**B. Displaying Products**
Where products are placed in a store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to track which products sell well and put them in easy-to-reach places. They also put high-priced items near the entrance to catch your attention.
**C. Spreading Out Staples**
Supermarkets put everyday items like bread and milk in different parts of the store. This makes you walk past other products that are more expensive. Chain stores do the same with products they are known for, hoping you will look for them and buy more.
**D. Making You Think You're Getting a Good Deal**
Some stores make their products look more exclusive by displaying only a few items at a time. This makes you think you're getting a special deal. But the products are still mass-produced.
**E. The Total Bill**
Shoppers are more likely to buy more if they focus on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix high and low-priced items to make you think you're getting a good deal.
**F. The Price Tag**
Shoppers are more likely to notice individual prices in chain stores, so stores make sure to highlight the price of each item. This also helps prevent shoplifting.
**G. Lighting**
Stores use lighting to make products look good. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh food look fresh, while chain stores use natural-looking lighting to show off clothes.
**H. Guiding You Through the Store**
Chain stores use different carpeting to guide you through the store. This makes you follow a certain path and look at products along the way.
**I. In-Store Promotion**
Supermarkets use big pictures and videos to make you want to buy certain products. Some stores even have screens on shopping carts that show you ads as you shop. This is designed to make you buy more on impulse.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. But in recent times, we're in danger of losing the variety of apples we have today.
The history of apples dates back to prehistoric times. People ate apples and threw away the seeds, which grew into new trees. In ancient times, people in Europe and Asia grew apples and stored them for the winter.
In the Middle Ages, people in Britain grew apples and made cider. They also introduced new apple varieties from other parts of Europe. Some apples were popular for eating fresh, while others were used for cooking.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in Britain and North America grew apples and took them with them when they traveled to new lands. The Pilgrims, who sailed to America on the Mayflower, brought apple seeds with them.
In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer in Iowa discovered a new type of apple that became very popular. It was called the 'Delicious' apple and is still widely grown today.
Another famous apple variety is the Granny Smith, discovered by Maria Anne Smith in Australia. She found a small tree growing in a pile of discarded fruit and transplanted it. The tree grew and produced a new type of green apple that became famous worldwide.
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but many varieties have been lost over time. Commercial growers often choose apples that are easy to transport and have a red skin, rather than those that taste good. However, consumers are starting to demand more variety in their apples, and it's important that we protect the diversity of apples for the future.

Richard Nerurkar, a top British distance runner, visited a training camp in Kenya. The camp is located 10 miles south of the equator, near the foot of Mount Kenya, the highest peak in Kenya. For three years, Richard had been training at this camp during the winter months. But this time, he decided to stay with the Kenyan runners at their national team training camp.
Richard was invited to join the Kenyan team after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000-meter race. He was excited to train with the Kenyans and learn about their training methods. The Kenyans are known for their success in distance running, and Richard wanted to know why.
At the training camp, Richard saw that the Kenyans had a simple and uncomplicated approach to running. They ate a simple diet, ran in a relaxed way, and seemed to enjoy competing. But Richard was curious about their training routine. The Kenyans did three workouts a day, with a total distance of about 40 kilometers. They also had a relaxed daily routine, with no complicated preparations for breakfast or dinner.
After his stay at the camp, Richard realized that the Kenyans' success couldn't be attributed to just one factor. He thought that their simple and pure lifestyle, combined with their hard work and passion for running, might be the key to their success.

Advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic recession. The problem is that advertising has not kept up with the changing economy. Advertisers often think in terms of big markets and big media, but as more brands and media have appeared, target markets have become smaller. As a result, even big brands often don't target the right people.
Let's think about our own shopping habits. When we go to the supermarket, we might buy 30-50 items. But most of these won't be advertised brands. In fact, we probably only buy a few hundred different brands in a year. And it's the same with other things like cars, clothes, and services. We don't buy many different brands.
According to a study, there are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. But most people don't buy more than 400 of these brands in a year. In fact, the average person buys only 4% of the brands they see advertised.
When we watch TV, we might see a few commercials for brands we buy or might buy in the future. But most commercials are for brands we don't care about. This means that most advertising is wasted.
However, advertising can still be effective. It's a cheap way to reach a lot of people, even if we can't know exactly who will respond. The key is to target the right people with the right message. This is harder than it sounds, but it's the best way to make advertising work.
In the past, advertisers thought that every reader of a publication or every viewer of a commercial break would rush out and buy all the advertised brands. But this is not the case. People only pay attention to a few ads and ignore the rest. This means that waste is inevitable.
Despite this, advertising can still be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proven this. The key is to use smart targeting to minimize waste and reach the right people."

Meet Charles Clover, a pioneer in building environmentally-friendly homes. He visits a special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which is considered the greenest dwelling in Britain. The house was designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale, two architects who have been passionate about sustainability for a long time.
The house is designed to be self-sufficient, using rainwater for washing and drinking, and recycling its sewage into compost for the garden. The Vales also use waste heat from appliances and their own body heat to keep the house warm. The house is so well-insulated that it's almost silent inside, and it's hard to hear any noise.
The Vales have been interested in green architecture for a long time and have written a book on the subject. They wanted to show that it's possible to build a house that is good for the environment without sacrificing comfort. They designed the house to be energy-efficient, using natural materials and minimizing waste. The house doesn't use mains water, and the Vales collect and filter their own water from the roof.
The house is also equipped with special features, such as a wood-burning stove that they only use in the coldest winter months. The Vales believe that people should be able to live comfortably without relying on central heating. They also have a small solar panel system that will generate electricity and even charge an electric car.
The house is surprisingly warm, even in winter, thanks to its insulation and design. The Vales claim that it's comfortable to live in, and they don't need to use the heating system much. They believe that people should adopt a more sustainable lifestyle and live in harmony with the environment.
The house was built at a reasonable cost, using local materials and craftsmen. However, the commercial building companies are not interested in adopting this approach, as it would require a significant change in their business practices.

Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was a rational person who believed in science. However, in 1920, he was convinced that photographs of fairies in a garden were real. He wrote an article and published the photos, saying that fairies were supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos confessed that they had faked them. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among the flowers. The photos are still beautiful, but the trick shows that the camera can be tricked. This is not new - even from the beginning of photography, people have been altering reality. With modern computer software, we can easily change our digital photos. So, it's not true that there was ever a time when photography was completely honest."

Blacksmiths have always been important in human history, and their work has often been admired and respected. In the past, blacksmiths were considered as valuable as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also known for their artistic skills. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for famous buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. In the past, ironwork was a key part of French and Belgian architecture. However, by the late 1960s, blacksmiths were almost extinct in Britain because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects didn't use decorative ironwork like they used to.
Recently, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and interior design, and blacksmiths are once again in demand. However, some of the work being done today looks similar to what was done in the past. Many manufacturers still make gates and balconies that look ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style"". You can even find rusty candlesticks with decorations in trendy design stores.
Luckily, there are also some talented blacksmiths who are creating unique and beautiful pieces. The British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is promoting the craft with an exhibition of ironwork at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. The exhibition features over 250 pieces, including bookends, a spiral staircase, and even an eight-foot gate. The money raised from the sale of these pieces will go to the individual artists and also to promote good ironwork.
The blacksmiths are excited about the new possibilities offered by modern power tools, which have freed them from the hard work of hammering hot metal. They can now shape, bend, and weld metal with ease. As one blacksmith says, ""This material allows us to express ourselves in a way we never could before."""

I QUIT SMOKING AND PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED. ONE COLLEAGUE WAS EVEN ANGRY. 'WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP SOONER?' SHE ASKED. I couldn't explain how I had gone from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. I went to a stop-smoking session, which was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I thought it was unfair to be pressured to quit by the anti-smoking campaign. Plus, I didn't have any health problems and I felt fine. I went to the session to write an article about people trying to give up smoking. I told the counsellor I wouldn't be trying to stop, as it wouldn't be fair. But during the session, I noticed I didn't want to smoke as much as I used to. The room was filled with smoke, but I didn't feel like smoking as much as the others. I think what happened was that the idea of quitting started to make sense to me. It was like a challenge, and I felt powerful when I thought about not smoking. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone else. Quitting was easy, and I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms. The only thing that was difficult was doing nothing on weekends, as I used to smoke when I was bored. Now, I miss smoking sometimes, but not too much. I have to get used to new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane, without smoking."

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel Prize. You might think that she would be a well-known figure in the UK, but many people don't know much about her. I've been asking my friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them don't know who she is.
Hodgkin was a remarkable person who made significant contributions to science. She was a pioneer in her field, and her work had a big impact on our understanding of the world. She was also a woman who lived through many important events in the 20th century, including the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.
When I started researching her life, I was surprised to find that there weren't many books about her. This is partly because scientists are often seen as being less interesting than artists or writers. However, this is unfair. Scientists can lead fascinating lives, and their stories can be just as compelling as those of anyone else.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in scientific biographies and autobiographies. These books can help to make scientists more relatable and human. They can also show that scientists are not just experts in their field, but people with personal lives and emotions.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a dedicated scientist who loved her work. She made important discoveries in the fields of chemistry and biology, and her work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the world. She was also a devoted mother and wife, and her personal life is an important part of her story.
Unfortunately, many people do not understand scientific concepts and may find it difficult to appreciate the importance of scientific inquiry. However, this does not mean that science is boring or uninteresting. On the contrary, science is a fascinating and important field that can help us to understand the world around us.
It is sad that many people do not know about Dorothy Hodgkin's achievements, but it is also an opportunity to learn more about her and the importance of science in our lives."

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability to find water underground. She can hold a forked hazel rod and sense where the water is. This skill is in high demand among farmers whose wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business, but they use a unique method to locate water. They use technology like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers, but Margaret also relies on her'sixth sense'.
Dowsing, the ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground, is a mysterious skill. There are different theories about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual explanations. Some scientists believe that everything on Earth vibrates, and dowsers can sense these vibrations. Margaret and her husband have a high success rate, with over 90% of their wells finding water.
The Wilkins have been busy during the recent drought, with a long waiting list. Most of their customers are farmers with dry wells or people building holiday homes in remote areas. Margaret tries to find water at a depth of 50-70 meters. She looks for areas with good rock formations and electricity nearby to power the pump.
To find water, Margaret starts by using a pendulum on a map. She then walks over the area with the forked hazel stick, feeling a strange sensation when she's above the water. She uses the stick to pinpoint the exact spot to drill. Her husband also dowses the area, and they usually agree on the best spot. If they don't agree, they keep searching until they do.
Margaret's ability to find water is not unique. Many people have been fascinated by this skill, and scientists have studied it. Margaret calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment"", and it's the best explanation for her success. Without this skill, the Wilkins wouldn't be able to run their business.

Have you ever dreamed of switching lives with someone for a day? We made it happen for four people. Let's hear their stories.
Amanda, a young mother of two, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a waitress at a popular London restaurant. Amanda was surprised by how busy and noisy the restaurant was. She struggled to carry a tray of drinks and accidentally spilled them. Despite feeling embarrassed, she enjoyed the experience and learned that waitressing requires being bubbly, organized, and able to handle a lot of customers. She realized that it's not just about being a mother, but also about being able to manage a busy job.
Cindy, on the other hand, swapped lives with Amanda and became a mother for the day. She found it exhausting taking care of two young children, making sure they ate, bathed, and went to bed on time. She also had to do household chores, which she didn't expect. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the experience and realized that being a mother is a tough job that requires a lot of energy and patience.
Rosemary, a dairy farmer, swapped lives with Hilary, a teacher at a primary school. Rosemary was surprised by how busy the school was and how much work teachers have to do. She helped with lessons, attended a staff meeting, and even participated in a physical education class. She found it difficult to stand in front of the class and speak, but enjoyed the experience. She realized that teaching is a challenging job that requires a lot of energy and dedication.
Hilary, on the other hand, swapped lives with Rosemary and became a dairy farmer for the day. She was surprised by how early farmers have to get up and how much work they have to do every day. She helped with milking cows, feeding calves, and inspecting sheep. She found it physically demanding and realized that farming is not just about working with animals, but also about managing a business.
All four people learned that their jobs are not as easy as they thought, and that there are many challenges involved. They appreciated the experience and gained a new respect for the people who do these jobs every day."

Hardenberger's parents gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present when he was eight years old. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, bought a real trumpet instead of a toy one. The boy loved playing it and his mother arranged for him to take lessons from a professional trumpet player.
Hardenberger's teacher, Bo Nilsson, was very good and helped him develop his skills. Hardenberger has said that he is grateful for his teacher's guidance and support. He believes that the trumpet is a simple instrument, but it's difficult to make it sound perfect. He has learned to accept its imperfections and make the best of them.
Hardenberger has always wanted to be a solo artist, unlike some other famous trumpet players who started in orchestras. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and wanted to be like him. He studied in Paris with Pierre Thibaud, who taught him that playing in an orchestra is not the only way to be a great trumpet player.
Hardenberger has a special gift for communicating with his audience through his music. He doesn't know exactly what this gift is, but he knows that it's what makes his music special. He believes that music has the power to move people and make them feel emotions.

**Get the Leading Edge - Motivate Yourself to Take Control at Work**
What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires and motivates others to achieve a common goal. It's not about being tall or intelligent. A good leader should be able to communicate their ideas clearly and confidently.
According to Pat Dixon, a leadership expert, enthusiasm is key. A leader should be able to inspire others and make them feel excited about the work they do.
John van Maurik, a leadership course director, believes that most people have the potential to be leaders. The key is to recognize and develop their skills.
In the workplace, a good leader motivates and supports their team. They set clear goals and achieve them in a way that makes everyone feel valued and involved.
Managers and leaders are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path.
Whether you're a boss or a team member, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
* Find your passions and convictions and use them to lead.
* Recognize your leadership abilities and use them to make a difference.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from your mistakes.
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but don't try to lead all the time.
Remember, leadership is not just about giving orders, it's about inspiring and motivating others to achieve a common goal."

**Abyss**
This 1989 film by James Cameron is a thrilling Cold War movie about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a submarine. The characters are memorable, especially the brave and funny foreman Bud. The special effects and production design are impressive, but the dialogue and character development could be better. The story is a bit predictable, but the film is still enjoyable.
**The Thin Red Line**
This 1964 film, directed by Andrew Marton, is an adaptation of James Jones' novel about the battle for Guadalcanal. It's a more traditional war movie compared to Terrence Malick's version. The film focuses on a single soldier and his sergeant, and it's often more faithful to the book. While Malick's film is more complex and poetic, Marton's version has its own strengths, such as a powerful flashback sequence.
**On Guard**
This 1999 film is a swashbuckling adventure loosely based on a 19th-century novel. It's a fun and entertaining movie with a great villain and some impressive sword fights. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and the actors have a good time playing their roles.
**Character**
This 1997 Dutch film is a period drama about a brutal bailiff and his son in 19th-century Rotterdam. The film is visually impressive, with detailed costumes and settings. However, the story is a bit slow and the characters could be more developed.
**The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This classic 1966 Western has been digitally remastered for video release. The sound quality is excellent, and the music is iconic. The story is a classic tale of good and evil, but the characters are all a bit morally ambiguous.

I used to have a good job, but I realized that I was sacrificing my own happiness for the sake of my career. Now I'm free to do what I want, and I'm excited to explore the world. My friends are all settled down with families, but they're a bit jealous of my freedom.
I'm worried about making the necessary arrangements, like renting out my flat and organizing my finances. I'm also concerned about leaving my old life behind and adjusting to a new way of living. Will I be able to handle the basics, like finding food and shelter? Will I feel out of place among younger travelers?
Many people in their 30s are taking a break from their daily routine to travel and explore. They're realizing that life is too short to spend it all in one place. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet, says that people are becoming more aware that they can have the adventure they've always wanted, if they're brave enough and organized enough.
For some people, traveling is a chance to have one last fling before settling down. For others, it's a way to escape the monotony of daily life and find themselves. Whatever the reason, it's a chance to take a step back and think about what's important.

I decided to take a break from my journalism career and focus on my family. However, when I turned 37, I realized that I was out of touch with the latest technology. I looked at my CV and saw that I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the norm. I didn't have any experience with computers, and most job ads asked for experience with desktop publishing.

The museum shows many precious historical objects, including Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the silver from the Holyrood chapel. The goal is to make the museum enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just experts.
The head of exhibitions, Dr. David Clarke, wants visitors to have a pleasurable experience. He believes that the museum should not try to recreate the past, but rather show the truth. The result is that the museum displays the objects exactly as they are, with explanations and captions to help visitors understand their significance.
The museum has a Discovery Centre for children, where they can learn through hands-on activities. The museum also has a temporary exhibition on the top floor, which changes every three years. The current exhibition features objects that have had a big impact on Scottish life in the 20th century. The Prime Minister even suggested an electric guitar!
Overall, the museum's modern design works well from the inside and the top, but some people are not sure if it's the right location. The museum's focus on showing the truth and using historical objects to tell stories is likely to make it a popular destination.

The end of print newspapers might take some time. It's a comforting idea, but it's also a big change. Some people might be scared or worried, but it's a natural process. Newspapers are slowly moving from print to online. However, this process is not as easy as it seems. While many people visit newspaper websites, the number of people buying print newspapers is decreasing. But, surprisingly, some newspapers are still doing well. For example, in some countries, like Asia, the number of people reading newspapers is increasing.
Some experts say that newspapers are dying because of the internet. But, actually, many people still read newspapers in print. In fact, some people read both print and online versions of the same newspaper. Newspapers are important because they help sell internet subscriptions. Print advertising is also much more profitable than online advertising.
Newspapers are trying to find a way to make money online. Some have built walls around their websites to charge readers for access. However, this is not easy. Newspapers need to maintain both their print and online versions, which is expensive and complicated. Despite these challenges, newspapers still have a strong brand in print, which helps them stand out online.

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. They can make a photo more engaging than a scene without people. However, photographing people can be challenging. You need to consider not only the technical and artistic aspects but also the actions, gestures, and expressions of your subjects.
**GROUP SHOTS**
When taking a group photo, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sitting or kneeling in front to make it easier to see everyone's faces.
**POSING FOR PICTURES**
People often stiffen up when they know they're being photographed. To relax them, suggest they find a comfortable position. You can also ask them to fold their arms or put their hands in their pockets.
**THE RIGHT APPROACH**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can create tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to be photographed and are often flattered by it. However, they may become self-conscious, so you may need to direct them.
**EYE CONTACT**
A photo gains impact when the subject looks directly at the camera. Ask your subject to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. You can remind them just before taking the photo.
**CANDID CONCENTRATION**
An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can be easier for them and make the viewer feel like they're observing the subject unnoticed.
**EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**
Expressions and gestures can tell us more about a person than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiles, winks, anger, or tears.
**SITUATION INTEREST**
The background or environment can add interest and information to a photo. Try to exclude irrelevant details and focus on the subject.
**INTERACTION**
Photos of people interacting with each other can be great. Look for eye contact, physical contact, or reactions to each other.
**PEOPLE AND PLACES**
When taking photos of people in a new place, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to include the background. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so that they form a foreground interest without obscuring the background.
**TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**
Decide why you want to take the photo. If it's to remember someone, you may want a posed photo. But for family photos, candid shots of events as they happen are often more lively and memorable.

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**
The way we work is changing. We're no longer just judged on how smart we are or how well we do our job. Now, we're also judged on how well we get along with others and how well we handle ourselves. This is becoming more important when it comes to getting hired, getting promoted, or even just doing our job well.
In the past, we were taught that being good at school was the most important thing. But now, it's not enough. Employers want people who can work well with others, who are adaptable, persuasive, and can handle their emotions and the emotions of those around them. These are the ""people skills"" that make up what's called emotional intelligence.
Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own emotions and the emotions of others. It's about being aware of how we feel and how others feel, and using that to make good decisions. It's not just about being nice, but about being able to handle difficult situations and make tough choices.
More and more companies are recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence in the workplace. They're realizing that it's not just about technical skills, but about how well we work with others. In fact, research shows that people can improve their emotional intelligence over time, and that it's an important part of growing and developing as a person.
Emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success, but it's an important part of being successful in our personal and professional lives. By developing these skills, we can become better employees, better friends, and better people."

""The media is discussing whether they should use content created by others without asking permission. With smartphones, it's easy to take pictures and videos of news events, and social media has changed the way we share them. Journalists are now using social media to get images quickly. However, some journalists have used photos and videos without asking the person who took them. There's a debate about whether this is right. Some people think it's okay to use these images if they're in the public interest, but others disagree.
Research shows that many people would take pictures or videos of news events, so user-generated content (UGC) will play a big role in the future of the media. But to keep a good relationship with the public, the media needs to make sure that people are properly paid for their work and always ask for permission to use their content.""

**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese treatment that is over 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbalism, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but its role in treating pain has received the most attention from Western doctors. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.
**How it Works**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is a state where the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are in harmony. According to this theory, energy flows around the body along special lines called meridians. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes out of balance, which can lead to weakness or illness. During a consultation, an acupuncturist will try to find where the energy is imbalanced. This is done by feeling the pulse on the wrist, examining the tongue, and assessing the person's overall appearance. The acupuncturist will also ask about the person's medical history, current health, and lifestyle.
**The Treatment**
An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin to stimulate the flow of energy. They may also apply warmth from smoldering herbs or pressure at specific points on the meridians. The person may feel a gentle, pleasant sensation when the needle is manipulated. There are over 300 points on the main meridians, with many more used less frequently.
**How it Works According to Science**
While Western doctors do not accept the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, they have found that acupuncture can be effective for pain relief. Scientists have suggested that stimulating specific nerves can block pain signals and stop them from reaching the brain. Others believe that stimulating acupuncture points releases natural pain-relieving substances.
**Types of Pain Treated**
Many people with chronic pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. Commonly treated conditions include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and post-operative pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain suffered by terminally ill people.
**Modern Use**
Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery is a more recent development. This has helped convince some doctors outside of China that there is more to acupuncture than just mind over matter. In China, acupuncture is now used during various operations, including tonsillectomies and caesareans, and even during open heart surgery.
**Effectiveness**
Clinical trials have shown that 50-80% of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally quote a similar success rate. They accept that it may not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists say that it usually takes between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief, but some improvement should be felt after just two or three visits.
**A Different Approach to Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists view their patients holistically, taking into account not just specific symptoms but also underlying weaknesses in the energy flow and external factors that may be causing the pain. This approach is different from the way Western doctors typically view pain.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others reject traditional Chinese theory and subscribe to scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by applying traditional Chinese medicine can deep changes be brought about that lead to a longer cure. It is important to choose an acupuncturist who refers you to a medical doctor if necessary."

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for a B2 learner:
P.D. James is a famous crime writer. She is known for her clever and complex stories. At first glance, she seems like a serious and authoritative person, but she is actually shy. She says that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is like her, but if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes on his own, just like his creator. James needs time to herself when she writes, and she can write anywhere as long as she has privacy.
James is humble and doesn't like to talk about being Britain's best-known crime writer. She has written 12 major detective novels, and millions of people around the world read them. She is a fan of her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine. James likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also enjoys books by male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.
James didn't become a successful writer until later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, a student at the university. James had to work long hours to support her family, including her two young daughters, after her husband returned from World War II with health problems. Her in-laws helped take care of the girls during those difficult years.
James worked full-time in administration for the National Health Service while writing in her spare time. She used her organizational skills to manage five psychiatric outpatients' clinics and later worked in the Police Department and the Home Office. She became familiar with forensic science, but it wasn't the sight of corpses that inspired her to write. Instead, she was drawn to the structure and construction of a crime novel. She wanted to write a serious novel about human beings, and detective stories allowed her to do that. James says that writing detective stories is a way of bringing order to chaos and confirming the value of life, even if that life is imperfect."

The study of handwriting, also known as graphology, is becoming more popular. In some countries, employers ask for a sample of a job applicant's handwriting to help decide if they are suitable for the job. Graphology is considered a science in many countries, and researchers believe it can be useful in detecting certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and revealing a person's psychological state. Many big companies now use graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential employees. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the value of graphology.
Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist, believes that handwriting can reveal a person's character, including their social class, intelligence, and mental ability. She says that graphology can be useful in assessing whether someone is honest, manipulative, or reliable. Marne also claims that graphology can predict criminal tendencies, identify people who are likely to commit suicide, and even detect heart and lung problems.
Marne says that it takes six years of study and experience to become a skilled graphologist. She believes that more research is needed to make graphology a more scientifically accepted field. However, some psychiatrists are critical of graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught, and has no other significance.

A new survey says that fresh air and comfortable chairs are important for a happy and healthy workforce. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as working environments. Our experts were a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist.
Office A: Advertising Agency
* The office is simple, with no central heating or ventilation. But the employees, who are part of a small team, seem happy. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and windows or using electric radiators.
* The furniture is not ideal, but the employees have a varied schedule, which helps reduce fatigue and boredom.
Office B: News Service
* The office is comfortable and well-maintained. The air quality is good, and there is a no-smoking policy.
* The chairs are good, but the space is impersonal and unstimulating. The employees are satisfied, but the office could be improved with more decorations and ways to share information.
Office C: Bank
* This office is standard and uninspiring. The air is clean, but the desks and chairs are not ideal.
* The employees are supportive and well-equipped with technology. The office is busy and has a positive atmosphere.
Office D: Newspaper
* This office has many problems. The air-conditioning is poor, and the space is cluttered and dusty. The furniture is old and uncomfortable.
* The employees are stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to improve the air quality, tidy up the office, and recognize individual successes.

Chewing gum is a popular habit that's been around for thousands of years. In ancient Greece, people chewed a resin from the mastic tree to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Later, American colonists followed the example of Native Americans and chewed resin from spruce trees.
In the 1860s, a new type of chewing gum was invented using a milky substance called chicle, which comes from a tree in the Central American rainforest. This gum was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, and it became a big business.
However, the people who collect chicle, called chicleros, have a difficult and dangerous job. They have to trek through the rainforest, avoiding snakes and insects, to tap the trees and collect the sap. The conditions are harsh, with high humidity and limited food.
Today, most chewing gum is made synthetically, with added ingredients like pine resin and softeners. The manufacturers claim that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay by increasing saliva production. Research is ongoing to develop new textures and flavors, with many new flavors using artificial ingredients.
Interestingly, the United States imports very little chicle from Central America these days, as most manufacturers have switched to synthetic ingredients. The world's gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products, with claims that gum can help with stress, energy, and oral health.

The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown is a professional who judges hotels. She visited the Globe Hotel to check its quality. From the moment she arrived, things went wrong. The receptionist was slow to help a guest and didn't even acknowledge Sue and her companion. This is a common mistake, but Sue was surprised because the Globe is a three-star hotel and she expected better service.
As she walked in, Sue noticed that the entrance was not well-designed. There was no one to greet her, and the long, empty corridor leading to the hotel entrance was not welcoming. When she arrived at the reception, the receptionist told her that they didn't have a record of her booking. It turned out that many of the hotel's rooms were empty that night.
Sue was not impressed with her room on the top floor. It was stuffy, and there was a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. She has been a hotel inspector for 11 years and has seen many problems like this before.
The next morning, Sue met the hotel's general manager, Robin Greaves. She told him about all the mistakes she had seen, including the poor service and the unpleasant smell in the main lounge. Greaves apologized and promised to fix the problems.
Despite the issues, Sue found some things to praise, such as the helpful assistant manager and the waitress who knew a lot about the hotel's history. The food was also good, which is why the hotel has a two-rosette rating. Sue gave Greaves some advice on how to improve the hotel and get a three-rosette rating, including serving better desserts.
As a hotel inspector, Sue has to be honest and tell the truth, even if it's difficult. She has to write a report about her visit and give feedback to the hotel. The hotel pays for this service, but it's worth it because it helps them improve and become better hotels."

Conquering the Seven Summits: My Journey to the Top of the World
I, Doug Scott, am a mountaineer who has climbed the highest peaks on each continent. I'll tell you about my experiences on each of these incredible journeys.
A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)
I climbed Mt. Everest with my partner, Dougal Haston. We were in a snow cave when Dougal started talking to our equipment officer, Dave Clark, about sleeping bags. I thought it was strange, as we were the only two people there. I realized that the high altitude was affecting me, and I started talking to my feet! We had to be careful not to get frostbite. On the summit ridge, I felt a sense of calm and confidence with Dougal by my side.
B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)
Mt. McKinley is considered the most challenging mountain in the world. Dougal and I took four days to reach the base camp. We decided to climb ""alpine style,"" carrying our equipment and food with us. The air pressure at high altitude made us feel like we were at 7,000m, even though we were only at 6,100m. We finally reached the summit, exhausted.
C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)
I climbed Kilimanjaro with Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the jungle and had to find a rock pool with water. We decided to take a different route to the summit, as the original one was too treacherous. We were relieved to find a trail of rubbish, which led us to the top.
D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu. We joined a group led by guide Phil Erscheler, who took us via the Polish Glacier. We had to wait out bad weather for three days before starting our ascent. The glacier was icy and windy, but we reached the summit.
E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
I climbed Vinson Massif with a team of guides. We traveled to the South Pole and then to the mountain. The air was crisp and clean, and the silence was surreal. We reached the summit in just eight hours, despite strong winds and temperatures below -50°C.
F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)
I climbed Elbrus with a team. We had to pay a commission to our guide to bring us into the valley. We acclimatized for a few days before starting our ascent. The wind was strong, but we reached the summit.
G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)
I climbed Carstensz with a team. We hoped to establish a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. We were warned about bandits, but we continued anyway. We reached the summit and were given a standing ovation.
I'm proud to have completed the Seven Summits challenge."
