People throw away a lot of trash. In many countries, people do not have to pay for throwing away their trash. This is a problem because it means people throw away too much trash. To fix this problem, some places started charging people for throwing away their trash. 
For example, in a town in the United States, people had to buy stickers for their trash bags. Only trash bags with stickers were picked up. This made people throw away less trash, but not as much as people thought it would. People just put more trash in their bags instead of buying more stickers. 
Some people even started throwing their trash away in secret instead of paying for it. This is a problem because it makes the trash problem worse. 
The only good thing that happened was that more people started recycling. But this might not be because of the stickers. People were already recycling before the stickers were introduced. 
So, charging people for their trash might not be the best solution. It's important to think about other things that might help, like how much money people have and how educated they are. 
It's clear that making people pay for their trash is not a simple solution. We need to think carefully about how to make it work."

Work and life are not the same. Many people are not happy with their jobs. They feel like they are just doing it because they have to, not because they love it. But loving your job is not enough. You also need to think about what your job does to you as a person, your mind, and your relationships. 
Some jobs can make you a bore, unable to talk to people outside of your job. You might be so busy that you have no time to think or be creative. Even if you are good at your job, it's not worth it if you are unhappy.
I want to find a way to make work more fulfilling. I think it should be a way to live a good life, not just a way to make money. It should be a way to discover new things about yourself and meet new people. 
But it's not easy. Many people are unhappy with their jobs, even doctors, accountants, and architects. They feel stressed and unhappy. The way we work is changing, and we need to find a new way.
I have been studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I have also looked at how people have worked in different cultures and how they have been happy. I want to find a way to make work more enjoyable and fulfilling. 
For example, hotels could be more than just a place to sleep. They could be a place where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotels could use the knowledge of their staff to provide more services. 
Work is a relationship. It's not just about doing a job, it's about being with other people and working together. We need to find a way to make work more enjoyable and fulfilling. We need to talk to each other and understand each other better."

'Broadcasting' comes from the idea of spreading seeds widely. It's a way to share information and pictures with many people. This idea is connected to the idea of growth and development. The first TV was like a big seed that spread to many homes. People thought it would be a good way to share information and entertainment with everyone.
The first TVs were like a special kind of radio. They showed moving pictures and people could watch them at home. Some people wanted to make TV a two-way communication tool, like a phone. But big companies and governments wanted to control TV and make it a one-way communication tool, like a newspaper.
TV was also like a show in a theater. People watched it in public places, not just at home. This was common in many countries. TV was popular because people wanted to have fun and be entertained at home. As people's living standards improved, they could buy TVs and watch their favorite shows.
TV was also a way for governments to reach many people with important information. It helped create a sense of community and unity among people. The way TV was organized was connected to the way society was changing. People were moving around more and living in different places. TV was a way to bring people together and share information.
The idea of broadcasting is changing now, and maybe we will use a different name in the future. But for a long time, TV was a way to share information and entertainment with many people, and it played an important role in modern society."

'Clutter Sometimes we have too many things and we still feel unhappy. It's normal to want a home that meets our needs, but sometimes we buy too much. Advertisers try to make us feel bad if we don't have something. Try not to look at advertisements next time you're outside. They can trick us into buying things without us realizing it.
Caves are interesting natural places. People have studied them for a long time. They want to know more about them. It's hard to visit some caves, so not many experts can study them. People who like to explore caves also learn about them.
Weather We used to rely on our senses to know the weather. Now we have machines that help us know the weather quickly. Computers can do complicated math fast.

'Music and Theatre
I used to think that opera is mostly about theatre. But now I think music is more important. When I worked at an opera house, I learned that music is the main thing. It should be like that. I come from a world where words and actors are important. There is no one directing the action once the show starts, and the performers and audience mostly speak the same language.
At a music performance, some people may not know much about music. They might feel a bit embarrassed or amazed by the skill of the performers. Even a good musician has worked hard to get that good. Going to a music performance is like watching a sports game - we know athletes work hard, but we can't do what they do.
Theatre audiences are different. They don't always understand how actors do their job and are not always amazed by what they do. They might not be impressed when an actor does a long speech. 
I think music can learn from theatre about how to make the audience feel more involved. Music is already like a show, with passion, humor, and drama. But sometimes the way we present music can make it feel too formal or too different from the audience. 
There are people working to make music more accessible and fun for everyone. I think music could be even better if it was more like theatre. Sometimes, music could be performed in new and exciting places, like a church or a park. This could make the performers and audience feel more connected.'

People have always wanted to have a safe place to live. We use locks and keys to keep our homes safe. Some people like electronic locks, but many people prefer to use physical keys. A locksmith company made an electronic lock with a metal key because people like the feeling of using a key.
I was nervous about visiting the modern art museum because I don't understand modern art. I like some of it, like pictures with fur and bright lights. But I don't know much about it.

Making movies is a difficult job. It's like taking a book and making it into a film. Sometimes, things have to be left out or changed. This can be frustrating, but it can also be helpful. 
When I worked on a script, I noticed that I could take out a lot of the talking and descriptions from the book and still get the same message across. This doesn't mean that the talking and descriptions in the book were not important. It's just that different things are needed for a book and a film. 
In a book, you need to tell the reader more about the characters. You need to remind them what the characters are like. In a film, you can show the characters and people can understand them better. 
Watching movies is a special experience. It's like going to a different world. You can forget about your problems and just enjoy the film. But when the lights come back on, you're back in the real world. 
Some people don't think movies are a real art. They just think they're entertainment. But many people love movies and work hard to make them. 
The film studios are a strange place. There are many small rooms and it's hard to find your way around. But the people who work there know what they're doing. They make movies that people love. 
Many people want to make movies. They read books about how to do it and take classes. Some people even make their own movies with a small camera. One person, Robert Rodriguez, made a film called El Mariachi for just $7,000. He became famous and made many more films. 
In the past, movie directors had to work for a long time before they made a famous film. They started by working on small projects. Now, with the help of technology, people can make movies quickly and easily."

I grew up in a city with many houses. They were all the same, with orange bricks or white walls. Sometimes, the smell of chemicals from a factory came and made the air smell bad. I don't remember much from when I was little, but I do remember looking out of a window and seeing the houses go on and on.
My mom was a small, strict woman. She was always angry and I didn't understand why. She was very particular about things, like making sure we didn't go into our neighbors' gardens or touch their flowers. She also liked to listen to the radio and make us sit quietly while she did. She had some friends, but they were all a bit strange. They would talk about boring things like the weather and how mean some people were.
As a child, I had to stay at home until I was five, and then I went to school. My mom would send me with other kids from the street to school. I remember the summer holidays, when I would see some interesting things outside of our neighborhood. There was an old man who told stories about his adventures on a ship, and a charity event where I got lemonade and tried to help a charity.
My mom didn't like politicians and thought they were only looking for money. She didn't like the idea of people sending money to the government. She didn't have much kindness in her heart, but she did take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at paintings. She wasn't very interested, but she liked it when it was free. Once, she saw a picture of a Roman soldier and said, ""I wouldn't want to meet him at night!"" That was the only time I saw her try to be funny.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on one side of the street. The sun was setting and it was getting dark. I knew this street from when I was a child. There were many houses with different styles and colors. Some houses had big porches and others had small ones. Some houses used to be stores, but now they are homes again.
I visited a friend who lives in a special kind of house called a loft. It used to be a curtain warehouse, but now it's his home and office. He wanted to make it feel cozy, so he put up a big piece of plastic to separate the living and working areas.
I also read about a writer named Bruce Chatwin. He wrote a book called ""In Patagonia"" that is very famous. He liked to travel and write about his adventures. But sometimes he made things up to make the stories more interesting.
I also liked to swim in the pool behind my house. One day, I had a great idea to swim all the way to the sea. I wanted to follow the rain and see where it goes. Swimming is a special way to explore the world and feel free.

Charles Darwin thought that people cry for no reason. But scientists now think that crying is important for people to connect with each other. When we are babies, we cry to get help from our mothers. This helps us feel safe and loved. As we grow up, we still cry, but it's not just to get help. We cry to show others that we care about them. For example, we might cry when we see someone who is sad or hurt. We might also cry when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. Even when we watch a sad movie, we are more likely to cry when we are with someone else. This shows that crying is an important way for us to connect with others and feel part of a group."

The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. We don't know exactly how much warmer it will get or what will happen. But we know that a warmer climate will change the weather everywhere. This will affect plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans use natural resources like air, water, and soil to live. We need these resources to grow food, build cities, and support our families. If these resources change, it will be a big problem.
We know that humans have made the air warmer by releasing bad gases. This is making the Earth warmer. Scientists are trying to understand how much warmer it will get and what will happen.
They use computers to predict what will happen. These computers are like big machines that use math and science to guess what will happen. But they are not perfect and can make mistakes.
Scientists think that the Earth will get warmer and this will cause problems. Some places might get more rain, while others might get less. This could cause floods, droughts, and heatwaves.
The warmer Earth will also cause problems for plants and animals. Some plants might grow better, but others might die. Some animals might move to new places to find food and shelter.
The sea level will also rise. This means that some cities and islands might get flooded. Many people will have to move to new places and might lose their homes.
This is a big problem and we need to think about what we can do to stop it from getting worse."

Art is hard to understand because we often think about it as a special thing that exists on its own, like a painting or a building. But art is actually something that happens in our lives, in our experiences. When we separate art from our everyday lives, it becomes hard to understand. 
Art is like a mountain peak. It's not just floating in the air, but it's connected to the earth. People who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, know that. They want to show how the earth is connected to the mountains. 
The same is true for art. To understand art, we need to think about how it connects to our everyday lives. We need to look at the things we do and see, and the things we experience. This is hard because we often think of art as something special and separate. 
But art is not just something special. It's a part of our lives. We can enjoy art in many things, like movies, music, and comic strips. These things are not just art, but they can be enjoyable because of their aesthetic quality. 
Many people think that art is only for special things, like museums and galleries. But art is everywhere. It's in our daily lives, in the things we do and see. When we connect art to our everyday lives, we can understand it better."

Many years ago, the 1990s were a tough time for people who work in advertising. There was a big economic problem, and many companies were not making money. This meant that people in advertising had to work harder and be more creative to make their ads successful. They had to make sure their ads were good and effective, but they didn't have a lot of money to spend.
In the past, advertising was not as important as it is now. Companies didn't think about what their customers wanted, they just made what they wanted to make. But now, companies know that they need to make things that customers want. This is good for advertising people because it means they have more work to do.
However, this is also hard for them because they have to make good ads with less money. They have to be very creative and work hard to make sure their ads are good. Some people think that advertising is not very important, but it is important for companies to make money.

Fashion is often thought to be a modern thing. But, actually, fashion has a long history.

Many people like music. It makes us happy. We use music for many things, like celebrations and parties. Music is also good for our brains. Playing an instrument can help us learn and focus.

But even though many people liked the film, it didn't make much money. It took a while for people to remember the film, but then it became popular again because of television.
Orson Welles made Citizen Kane. It was his first film, and he did a great job. He had a good team to help him, including a camera man, a writer, and someone who made special effects.
Welles wanted to make a film about a newspaper boss who was like Hearst. He thought this would be a great chance for him to be both the director and the actor. He was very excited and worked hard.
There is a story about a man named Dermot who was going to play golf. He told his wife he might be late and she said it was okay. He wanted to talk to someone at the golf club. His wife was a little worried, but he said it was okay.
Now, let's talk about job titles. A recent study found that people are very unhappy with their job titles. Most people think that job titles cause problems at work. Many people would rather have a better title than a raise in pay. This is because people want to feel important and powerful. But the truth is, job titles are just words and don't really make us feel better.""

I went to Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. They are my job and my hobby. I like to capture special moments with my camera. One day, I took a great picture of a smoke plume from a burning oil well. It was a lucky shot, but it made me famous. After that, I became a freelancer, which means I work for myself. I take pictures for different clients.
I went to Vienna for a job. The publisher wanted me to take pictures of the city for a book. The book will show pictures of four cities in four seasons. I had already taken pictures of London, Paris, and Rome. Now it was Vienna's turn.
I was supposed to work with another photographer, but he quit. So, the publisher asked me to do the job instead. I was happy to go. I like Vienna. I had been there before with my wife, but it was hot and busy. This time, I was alone and it was cold and quiet. I liked it.
I spent the first day exploring the city. I rode the tram around the city center and looked at the buildings. The weather was cold and grey, but I liked it. I wanted to take some good pictures.
The next morning, I went out early to take some pictures. The snow was falling, and the city was quiet. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to take a good picture of it. I decided to take a partial picture instead. It was still a good shot.
I like taking pictures because it's like magic. You can make something special happen with your camera. Even though I know how it works, it still feels special. That's why I love taking pictures."

The Hayward Gallery in London is a special place now. It's not because of a big and expensive show, but because of a small and interesting exhibition about art that moves. This kind of art is called kinetic art. The exhibition shows many different artworks that move or talk about movement. The curator, Guy Brett, has spent his life studying this kind of art. He didn't add a lot of words to the exhibition, so visitors can make their own discoveries.
Some people like David Hockney's art because it's easy to understand and looks like something they know. Others like him because he's a nice person and talks well. But does that mean his art is not good? Some people think he's not a great artist, but Hockney says that's okay. He knows his art might not be perfect, and only time will tell if it's important.
I went to many art exhibitions and saw some good and some not-so-good art. Sometimes exhibitions try to tell us what to think or feel. I wanted to do the opposite. I worked with seven artists to create an exhibition called ""Window-shopping"". We showed our individual artworks together, and they didn't have a special theme. We just wanted to show that art can be different and interesting.
Some people don't like to think too much about art because it makes it less fun. But knowing more about art can actually make it more enjoyable. Art is not just about looking at something pretty; it's also about understanding why we like it and why we like certain things at certain times.

Metals
A long time ago, people liked shiny things. They might have found a shiny yellow stone in a river. It wasn't like other stones. It was special. Maybe this is how people first found gold. Gold is soft and easy to work with. People liked it a lot.
Copper might have been found by accident too. When people realized how useful copper was, they looked for more. They wanted to make tools and things with copper. This is how people learned to work with metals.
St Ives
We walked down a winding street in St Ives. It was windy and rainy. The streets were empty and the windows were closed. We had taken a small train to get there. The weather was getting worse. I had promised my friend that we would have nice walks and cozy evenings. But now it didn't seem so good.
Computer Modelling
It's hard to learn about the past. The people who lived a long time ago are gone. We can't ask them questions or see how they lived. Archaeologists find clues, but we can't test our ideas. We can't go back in time. But we can use computers to create a virtual world. We can make digital people and see how they live. We can change things and see how they react. This helps us learn about the past.

Vervet Monkeys
One day, a strange monkey came to a group of vervet monkeys. The dominant male monkey saw the stranger and knew that he wanted to join the group. If the stranger joined, the dominant male would lose his important position. The dominant male had a clever idea to keep the stranger away. He made a loud noise to scare the stranger, like the sound a leopard makes. The stranger ran back to his trees. This happened many times. But then the dominant male made a mistake. He made the loud noise while he was walking across the open ground. The stranger didn't run away this time.
Cats
In one village, people collected their cats' prey. They found over 1,000 things that the cats had caught. A professor in America saw this and thought that all the cats in Britain must catch 100 million birds and small animals every year. But this is not true. Most cats are in towns and don't catch as many animals as the cats in the village. The important question is not how many animals the cats catch, but if it's good for the animals. The answer is yes. People help the birds by feeding them and providing homes, so the bird population is high.
Buffaloes
Buffaloes are important for people who live near the water. They go to the reed beds every day, slowly and wearily. They stand on the edge of the water and complain about being tired. Then they go into the water and rest. They may stay there for a long time, eating the green shoots that grow in the water. They move slowly and quietly, and it's hard to notice them.
Picasso's Painting
Pablo Picasso painted a picture of a fish and some scales. The fish look alive, but the picture is not easy to understand. The artist used many colors and shapes to create a calm and peaceful feeling. But if you look closely, you can see that the fish are ready to fight, and the crab is ready to defend itself. The picture is not just about the fish, but also about the struggle between different things."

""Photography is a way to capture pictures. It has been used for over 150 years to show us many things. We can see pictures of people, places, and things from far away. Photography helps us remember important moments and events. It also helps us learn about the world and its history.
A long time ago, people drew pictures on cave walls. These pictures were like photographs, but they were not taken with a camera. They were made by hand. People have always liked to draw and take pictures. It's a way to express themselves and tell stories.
When photography was invented, it was very special. It was like a magic box that could capture pictures. People thought it was very important and useful. They used it to record important events and people. Photography was like a window to the world, showing us things we had never seen before.
But photography is not just about taking pictures. It's also about understanding what the pictures mean. People from different cultures might understand pictures differently. Photography is like a language, and like any language, it can be difficult to understand if you don't know the words.
Over time, photography has changed. It's not just for taking pictures of people and things. It's also used to tell stories and show us things that happened a long time ago. Photography can help us learn about the past and understand the world better. It can also be used to make us think about important issues and make a difference.""

**How to Write Poetry and Stories**
Writing poetry and stories can be like playing a game. You need to be careful and listen to your own voice. Don't try to be perfect. Just read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination go free.
Some people like to write when they feel happy and safe. Others write when they are sad or upset. Everyone writes in their own way. The important thing is to find your own way and not follow someone else's rules.
**Short Stories**
When writing a short story, don't try to tell too much. Keep it simple and short. Use flashbacks only if it helps to explain something important. Dialogue is a good way to make your story more interesting. It can help you show what people are thinking and feeling.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves. You don't need to know everything, but you need to know what you're doing.
**Language**
Language is a natural part of being human. We learn to talk without trying. But writing is different. It's not natural, and it's not easy. We need to understand how writing works and how our brains work to make it easier.

I'm writing a book about a man I knew, but I'm not sure what to call it. It's not a story with a beginning, middle, and end. It's just my memories of the time I spent with him. I didn't know much about what he did when we weren't together. I could make up some things to fill in the gaps, but I don't want to. I just want to tell what I know.
To protect the people who are still alive, I gave them fake names and changed some details. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and maybe he never will be. If he dies, people might not even remember him. But maybe his way of living and his good character will make a difference in people's lives, even after he's gone.
My book might be useful for people who want to learn more about this man's life. I didn't write down what he said exactly, but I have a good memory and tried to remember what was important. I also added some words to the conversations to make them sound more real.
I'm worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone unless you grow up with them. You can't learn everything about someone just by talking to them. You have to live with them and experience what they experience. That's why it's hard to write about people from another country. I usually only write about people from my own country, but in this book, I'm trying something new.
I didn't try to make my characters seem like they really are. They are just how I saw them."

'POETRY RECITALS
In the past, people often thought that the world of poetry was confusing. But when we look back, we can see that there were many different types of poetry and many different poets. Today, there are many different kinds of poetry and many different ways to share it with others. Some poets write poems that are meant to be read on the page, while others write poems to be read out loud. This can cause some problems. Poets who write for the page might not be good at reading their poems out loud. And poets who are good at reading their poems out loud might not be good at writing them.
There are many ways to share poetry with others. Some people read poetry in small groups, while others read poetry in schools or at special events. Some events even combine poetry with music. The main reason for these events is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for a special group of people.
It's good to hear poets read their poems out loud. It can help us understand the poem better. But it's also important to read the poem on the page. This way, we can see the words and understand the poem even better.'"

**Oral History**
When historians ask people to tell them about the past, they need to be careful. The person telling the story might not remember everything correctly. The historian might also influence what the person says. Even if the historian doesn't ask questions, the person might still change what they say because the historian is there.
It's hard to get a true picture of the past. People's memories can be mixed up with things they learned from others or from the media. They might also remember things differently because of how they feel about them. This can make it hard to know what really happened.
**Animal Science**
There are two ways to study animals. Some people look at how animals' bodies work, like how their nerves and muscles work together. Others study animals in their natural habitats and look at how they behave.
There are also two main groups within this field. Some scientists study how animals learn and behave in labs, usually with rats and pigeons. Others study how animals behave in the wild, without teaching them anything.
**Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you need to learn two things at the same time. You need to learn about the subject itself and how to study it. This can be hard because you need to understand both the content and the way it's studied.
The social sciences are not just about common sense. Each subject has its own way of studying and its own ideas. These ideas are important because they help us understand social life better.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was an art that involved many things like order, arrangement, and symmetry. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought about how to make buildings look good and how to make them serve a purpose.
The history of classical architecture is complex. People built simple homes and huts before they built more complicated buildings. These early buildings still had some of the same ideas that were used in later, more sophisticated buildings."

Lily was learning to drive a van. She kept it a secret from her brother-in-law, Chen. She would drive around the town, practicing on quiet roads. Chen was surprised when he found out, but he was happy that Lily could drive. He asked her to take him and his son, Man Kee, on a trip.
Lily was a little worried about getting lost, so she bought a map. Chen was impressed that she got a discount. They set off early in the morning and drove to the seaside. Lily drove very well, and Chen was proud of her. They parked the van in a quiet street near the sea.
Chen looked through a telescope at a ship in the distance. He showed it to Man Kee and told him it would take them back home one day. Lily and Mui, Chen's wife, joined them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders, and they looked at the ship together.

""The internet is a great place to share your thoughts about books. Amazon, a big online bookshop, lets anyone write a review about a book. This is a good idea because it helps people decide if they want to buy a book or not. But, some people might not be honest in their reviews. They might write nice things about their own book or bad things about someone else's book. Amazon tries to stop this by checking the reviews. They make sure the reviews are not too short or too mean. But, it's hard to check all the reviews, so sometimes bad reviews might be posted.
Some authors even write fake reviews to help their own book. One author, Lev Grossman, wrote fake reviews to make his book look better. But, he got caught and had to admit what he did.
Most authors write nice messages on their book's page, asking people to buy their book. But, some people might not be the authors. They might pretend to be famous authors, like John Updike. Amazon tries to stop this too.
When a book is popular, some people might write bad reviews to hurt the author. This happened with a book called 'We've Got Spirit'. The author wrote about a cheerleading team, and some people in the team were unhappy about it. They wrote bad reviews, but Amazon took them down.
Despite all this, most people take their reviews seriously and write honest things about the books. This helps other people decide if they want to buy a book or not. The writer George Orwell thought it was important to share your real feelings about a book, and Amazon's way of doing things is a good way to do that.""

Art is important. People like art that is new and different. But sometimes, people don't like art that is new and different. They think it's not real art. We want artists to be special and different from us. We want them to make art that is new and exciting.
Let me tell you a story. An artist chose a sentence from a book about pictures. The sentence said, ""What are they all about?"" The artist thought about it and said, ""There are many kinds of pictures."" Then, the artist asked someone to help him make a painting. The artist wanted the painter to write the sentence on the canvas in simple black letters. So, my question is: is this a painting?
Artists often make the same kind of art over and over. People like it when artists do the same thing. But sometimes, artists want to try something new. It's not easy to be an artist. We have to like the new things that artists make.
There is an artist named Eric Rimmington. He is making a new kind of art. He is drawing pictures of the London Underground. He likes the Underground because it's special. He wants to show people what it's like down there.
I am going to tell you another story. I went to a place to rest and be alone. I was feeling sick, so I went to this place to get better. I am alone, but I am not happy or sad. I am just thinking about my memories. I like making art because it helps me make sense of the world. It's like taking a piece of cloth and making it beautiful."

Our past is important because it helps us feel connected to our family and community. We learn about our past from our grandparents and the stories they tell. This helps us understand our present and future. We inherit not only our genes but also our culture from our ancestors.

Museums are important because they help us learn about our past. They should make their collections easy to understand and fun to visit. Museums are special because they show us real things that actually existed in the past.

Writing Reviews
Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and are only read for a short time. They are usually short and are published in newspapers or magazines. People think that writing reviews is not important because it's not a main job. But writing reviews is a difficult job that needs skill. A reviewer must be able to write clearly and make sense. They must also know a lot about different things and be able to write for different audiences. Some people think that writing reviews is not important because it's not as good as writing a novel or a serious book. But many people enjoy writing reviews and like to keep them as a record of their work. 
Some people think that professors should not write reviews because it's not their main job. But in the English-speaking world, it's common for professors to write reviews and for writers to do both. This is good for readers because they know that the reviewer has some knowledge about the subject. It's also good for professors because it helps them to stay sane and remember that they need to explain things clearly to non-professors."

Some things cannot be rushed. If you add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull on a fishing line too hard, it will get tangled. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can learn to do some things faster, like solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But some things cannot be rushed, and if we try to hurry them, they will break or get mixed up.
Our minds have three different ways of working. One way is very fast and helps us react quickly. This is like when you ride a bike and your body knows what to do without thinking. Another way is slower and helps us think carefully. This is like when you try to fix a problem or solve a puzzle. The third way is the slowest and helps us think deeply and creatively. This is like when you daydream or think about big questions.
We need all three ways of thinking to be smart. Sometimes we need to react quickly, sometimes we need to think carefully, and sometimes we need to think deeply. If we try to rush our thinking, it can get mixed up. We need to give our minds time to think slowly and deeply to be creative and wise.

'Othello: A Great Play
I want to tell you about a special play called Othello. It's a very good play and I'm glad I got to see it. When it first came to London, I didn't like the actor who played Othello because he was too young. But now I think he did a great job. The whole cast was very good. Some scenes were very exciting, like when the characters played games and got a little out of hand. Another scene made me feel sad because it was very emotional. The play was very well done and I think you should see it.

Food is very important for us. We like to cook and eat together. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special occasions or fancy dishes. But it's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. It's better than buying a packet or can. You can also make a yummy chocolate treat in just five minutes. Cooking is a way to show love and care for others. We share food to show we care about each other.
Food is also important for special events like birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. We don't usually have takeaways for these occasions. We want to share food and be together.

Dr. Johnson said that writing is hard work. He believed that when we write without effort, we don't enjoy reading. I looked at my old school essays and was surprised to see that I didn't make many mistakes. I think it's because writing by hand was hard and slow. This made me think carefully before writing.
Now, with computers, it's easy to write and correct mistakes. But this can make our writing sloppy. People who use computers often spend a lot of time fixing mistakes.
Emails are like handwritten letters, but they can be sent quickly and easily. This is good because people can write to each other more often. However, emails can be difficult to read and understand because they are written quickly.

Doctors say that eating breakfast is very important for our health. But in the past, breakfast was not a common meal in England. In old times, people didn't eat breakfast unless they were very important people like kings and queens. 
In the 1500s, people started eating breakfast more often. Some people think this is because there was more food available. But others think it's because people started working at fixed times and needed energy to start their day. 
Before, people didn't eat breakfast because they didn't need to. But as people started working early, they needed to eat in the morning to give them energy. So, breakfast became important for everyone, not just rich people.'

'Photography When someone takes a photo, they choose what to show and how to show it. This is because of their skills, what they like, and what they've learned. It's also because of the way people think and feel about photos. We will look at how all these things affect the photo and how people react to it.
For example, when we see a photo in a newspaper, we might wonder if it shows what really happened. Or maybe it shows what the person taking the photo wanted us to see. Is it just one moment in time, or is it a symbol of something bigger?
More than just a game For me, sport is not just a game. It's about being confident and working hard. You need to focus on your goal and ignore everything else. It's not easy, but it can teach you to work well with others and be a good team player.

I was amazed by the bird's singing and felt happy and sad at the same time. Finally, I fell asleep.'

Birds have been important to human culture for a long time. People love, fear, and respect them. But what does this say about us? 
In the garden, a little brown bird is bumping against the glass. It's a wren, a special bird with a special meaning. Some people think it's trying to tell us something, while others just think it's stuck in the greenhouse. 
Wrens have been in British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the direction the wren flew in would tell them their luck. Today, people still like to keep wrens as pets or put their pictures on things. 
Birds are important to our culture because they help us understand the natural world. We have a special connection to birds because we need them to survive. This connection is important and has been passed down through generations. 
Some birds are more important than others because they are in stories and legends. The red kite, for example, used to be a common sight in London, but it disappeared. Now, people are trying to bring it back. 
Birds are important to us because they remind us of who we are. We admire their freedom and singing. Some people think these feelings are old-fashioned, but they're still important to us. 
Birds are also important because they help us understand the environment. If birds are in trouble, it means the environment is too. 
The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the past and the present. It's a mystery that we can't fully understand, but it's special."

Maps are used to show how things are related to each other on the Earth's surface. This is done by showing distance and direction. A long time ago, people used to measure distance by how long it took to walk or travel, but this didn't give exact distances. Direction was not as important for people who just wanted to know where to go and how far it was. Maps were not always accurate, and different maps used different ways to show things.
Over time, cartographers (people who make maps) got better at measuring distance and direction. They used new tools and ideas from other sciences, like astronomy. They also used the Earth's magnetic field to help them make more accurate maps.
As people's needs changed, cartographers had to make new kinds of maps. For example, soldiers needed maps that showed accurate terrain features, and archaeologists needed maps that showed where old things were found. Today, cartographers make maps for many different purposes, like showing where things are used or what the weather is like.
It's important to remember that maps are not always perfect and can be old-fashioned. Cartographers have to be careful when making maps and should not be copied from old maps without checking. Maps are very important because they help us understand how people lived in the past."

We can talk to each other in a special way. We use language to communicate with each other. It's like a special power that we have. When we're alone, we might talk to ourselves or even to animals or plants. Language is like an instinct, like how spiders spin webs. We don't need to learn how to talk, we just know how.
The weather and climate are important for animals and plants. The weather can be hot or cold, and it affects where things grow. In some places, it's always warm and wet, and lots of things can grow there. In other places, it's cold and windy, and not many things can grow.

Scientists have been studying how the aye-aye finds its food. They gave it some logs with holes in them. Some holes had insects inside and some were empty. The aye-aye went straight to the holes with insects. The scientists thought maybe it was using its eyes, nose, or ears to find the insects. But it wasn't. The aye-aye can even find empty holes!
The scientists think the aye-aye is using a special way to find the insects. It taps the wood with its finger and listens for the sound. It can also hear the insects moving. This is like how some bats use sound to find their way in the dark.

I like working with the land. I used to work on sheep farms in Australia. Planting trees sounded like a great idea to me. My family liked it too. We started planting in 1968. It rained a lot that year, but we still had fun. We planted 70 acres of trees.
It was hard work, but I enjoyed it. We had to wear special clothes and boots to keep us warm and dry. We used bags to carry the trees and had to get them in a straight line. It was hard, but we got used to it. After a while, we could plant trees easily.
I liked the physical work, and it made me strong. When I thought about the trees, I thought about the natural world and our place in it. This made me think a lot about the world and our connection to it.

I was surprised when someone gave me a big cardboard box. Inside, I saw three small grey badger cubs. They were very small, about 8 inches long, and had soft, fluffy coats and big, milky eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. They were brought to our farm because their mother was killed while digging a hole for a pipe. The cubs were cold and hungry, but I took care of them. I named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.
At first, I fed them with a special bottle and wiped their bottoms with a warm cloth to make them feel like their mother was licking them. After a few days, they started eating solid food and drinking from a bottle. They were very happy and played with each other.
But one of the cubs, Willow, got sick and died. I was sad, but I took care of the other two. Later, a farmer found another badger cub and brought it to us. We named him Willow II. He was a bit different from the others, and it took him a while to eat and drink. But eventually, he got better.
As they grew up, the badgers started to go out at night and play in the orchard. They would chase each other and even play-fight with us. It was fun! But we also had to be careful because other badgers might come and try to hurt them.
We decided to build a special home for the badgers, called a sett. It had tunnels, a big enclosure, and a special door that opened to the outside. The badgers loved it and started to explore it at night. They would curl up in their new home and sleep.
Now, the badgers are happy and healthy. We still see them sometimes, and they come to say hello. They have their own territory now, and we are proud of what we did to help them."

Dr. Toby Clark is a scientist who wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley. Halley was a famous astronomer who lived a long time ago. He was known for discovering a big comet, but he also did important work on the compass. He wanted to know how the compass worked and how it was different from true north.
Halley sailed on a ship called the Paramore to find the answer. He went to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Rio de Janeiro. He sailed up to Newfoundland and back to England. He wrote a book about his journey and what he found.
Dr. Clark wants to do the same journey again to see how the compass works today. He wants to use special instruments to measure the magnetic field of the Earth. This will help us understand the Earth better.
Dr. Clark is a good sailor and has already sailed a long way. He wants to do this journey because he is interested in Halley's life and work. He thinks Halley was a very important person who did many amazing things.

In the summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that has puzzled people for a long time. How can birds have such a big, showy tail when it might not be helpful in the wild? Some scientists, like Charles Darwin, thought that birds evolved to be the way they are because of a process called natural selection. This means that the birds that are best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and have babies.
But the peacock's tail doesn't seem to be very useful. It's big and heavy, and might even get in the way. Darwin thought that the females liked the males with the showy tails because they were beautiful, but his friend Alfred Russel Wallace thought that the females might like them for another reason. He thought that the males with the showy tails might have some other good qualities that the females can see, but that we can't.
Now, scientists are trying to figure out what the hens really like about the peacocks' tails. They are studying the birds at Whipsnade and looking at how the hens choose their mates. They are also looking at whether the males with the showy tails are healthier or stronger than the others.
One scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that birds with showy feathers might be healthier because they are less likely to have diseases. But the scientists at Whipsnade haven't been able to test this idea yet.
The scientists are also looking at whether the babies of the males with the showy tails grow faster or are healthier than the babies of the males with less showy tails. If they find that the babies of the showy males are healthier, it will mean that the females are choosing the males for a good reason.
There is one more idea that might explain why peacocks have such big, showy tails. It's called ""Fisher's Runaway"". This idea says that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the others, his sons will inherit his tail and his daughters will like long tails too. Over time, the males with the longest tails will have more babies, and the females will like longer tails even more. This could be how the peacocks' tails got so big and showy."

'MY DREAM BOAT I like my boat, ""The Westerman"". It's old-fashioned, but with some new ideas. This week, many big boats are on show in London. They are very modern and have many new things. But my boat is different. It's like a boat from 100 years ago. People might think I'm a romantic, but I'm not. This boat has old-fashioned design, but it's also modern. It's a good mix.
Some people think that new technology makes sailing too easy. They don't have to work hard to fix things. But I think it's good to have some challenges. It makes sailing more fun. My boat has a stove for warmth and a cozy place to sleep. But I don't want my boat to be like a big hotel on the water. I want it to be a boat, not a house.
I used to have another boat, ""Hirta"". It was old and had no fancy things. But it was a good boat. I sailed it around Britain for a TV show. It taught me that you don't need many things to have a good time on the water. Now, I have ""The Westerman"". It's my new boat. I designed it with a friend. We drew it on a napkin and then used a computer to make it perfect. It's a good boat. It's strong and looks old-fashioned. It's like a real boat, not a new one. I'm happy with it.'

**Relax and Recharge at a Health Farm or Country House Hotel**
Many people visit health farms and country house hotels to relax and feel better. I visited five different places to see what they are like. 
**Henlow Grange**
I went to Henlow Grange for six days. My room was very comfortable and I felt relaxed. I did some exercise classes and had many different treatments, like massages and facials. The staff were very friendly and professional. I felt very relaxed and full of energy when I left.
**Shrubland Hall**
Shrubland Hall is a big, old house with a calm atmosphere. When I arrived, I had a medical check-up to make sure I was healthy. Then I did some exercise and had a special diet to follow. The food was nice, but I was a bit hungry sometimes. I also had massages and other treatments. The staff were very nice and friendly.
**Careys Manor**
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it's a big, old house with a nice lounge. The food is very good, but if you want to lose weight, you need to be careful. There is a gym and a pool, and you can also get treatments like massages and facials.
**Cliveden**
Cliveden is a big, beautiful house with many things to do. You can exercise, ride horses, or go for a walk in the garden. The food is very good, and there are many different treatments available. I had a facial and a massage, and I felt very relaxed.
**Springs Hydro**
Springs Hydro is a modern, purpose-built place with many facilities. The aromatherapy massage was very good, and the carrot cake was delicious. However, it's very big and has many calories, so you need to be careful if you want to lose weight.
These are just a few examples of health farms and country house hotels. They are great places to relax, exercise, and feel better."

**Natural Talents**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are almost the same genetically. Our bodies and brains are different, but not much. This means that what makes us special is not very big. 
We thought that humans were special because we make art. But, animals make art too! Chimpanzees use sticks as tools and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Even monkeys have a simple language.
We have few differences between humans and animals. Art is one of the main differences. But, our ancestors didn't make art for a long time. The earliest art we know of is from 35,000 years ago.
Some people say that human art is special because it's not useful, it's for pleasure, and it's learned. But, birds sing for pleasure and animals make tools. And, humans can learn to make art like animals.
There was a famous art show in London where chimpanzees made paintings. The paintings were not useful, but the chimpanzees made them for fun. Some people even bought the paintings!
This shows that human art is not very different from animal art. Both are made for pleasure and not for a specific purpose."

Charles Blackmore went on a big adventure. He crossed the Taklamakan Desert in China. It's a very big and very hot desert. Many people have never been there before. Charles led a team of eight people, including four Britons, one American, and four Chinese. They had 30 camels and six camel handlers. The handlers had never worked with camels before, but they were good drivers.
They walked for 59 days to cross the desert. It was very hard. They had to deal with bad weather, no water, and sick camels. But they found some water and kept going. They were very tired and hungry, but they didn't give up.
Charles was scared at first, but he knew he could do it. He wanted to prove to himself that he could do something big. He wrote a book about his adventure. He is very proud of what they did. He says it was the most challenging thing he has ever done.

I started doing things by hand, like sewing and washing up. I found it was much more relaxing and enjoyable. I could listen to the radio or talk to my family while I did these things. I also liked the feeling of creating something with my own hands.
I started to think about all the things we have in our house that we don't really need. Do we really need a freezer or a microwave oven? Maybe we can save money by not using them. I even thought about not using electric lights!

'Sleep is very important. We spend about a third of our lives sleeping. Scientists don't know exactly why we need so much sleep. There are three ideas about why we sleep. One idea is that our body needs sleep to stay healthy. When we sleep, our body fixes any problems that happened during the day and makes us strong again. Another idea is that sleep helps us learn new things. When we sleep, our brain helps us remember what we learned during the day. Without sleep, we might not remember.

This book is about how cities are growing and how we can live in harmony with nature.
Another naturalist, Linda Bennett, chose a book by Niko Tinbergen. This book is about animal communication. Niko Tinbergen was a scientist who explained his findings in a way that everyone could understand. He worked with a talented artist, Eric Ennion, to make the book very interesting.
Lee Durrell chose a book by his father, Gerald Durrell. This book is about his family and their adventures with animals. Lee read this book when he was doing research in Madagascar and it made him feel happy and inspired.

DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS? We asked five big book publishers in Britain about how book reviews affect the success of a book. Here is what they said.
Publisher A Reviews are very important for us. People often buy a book because of a good review. Publishers are happy if a book gets a mix of good and bad reviews. This can make people want to read the book to decide for themselves.
Publisher B Book publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to get their books reviewed. Some book reviews are better than others. The best reviews are those that talk about the book's content, not just the author's name.
Publisher C Reviews are very important for our company. Without reviews, we wouldn't know if people like our books. Good reviews can make people want to buy a book.
Publisher D In Britain, book reviews don't always affect sales. Sometimes people don't read reviews. Some books become popular even if they get bad reviews. It's hard to know why.
Publisher E We all want good reviews, but do they really help sell books? I once published a book and got great reviews, but it didn't sell well. People thought they didn't need to buy the book because they had read the reviews. Does it matter who writes the review? In the past, people listened to famous reviewers. Now, people like reviews from unexpected people or ones that are funny or interesting.

Volunteer Tourism
Some people go to other countries to help. They pay money to do this. If they gave this money to the local people, it could help more people. This is especially true for people who go for a year to help. They don't need special skills, so they might not really be helping.
Some people think that volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can also help solve problems and make the world a better place. But, if only rich people from rich countries volunteer, it might not help the people who need it most.
Volunteering can be good or bad. It can be like helping others or just helping yourself. Some people volunteer to make a difference, but it might not change anything. It's like giving a little bit of money to someone in need, but it's not enough to solve the big problems.
We should be careful about volunteering. We should make sure it's really helping and not just making things worse. We should also think about why we're volunteering and what we're really trying to achieve.

I wake up to the radio every morning. Many people need something to help them get out of bed. That's why we have clock radios. How do you choose a good one? I tested five clock radios with my friends Tom and Paul. One radio had a special feature called a ""dual alarm"". It's supposed to wake you up at different times on weekdays and weekends. But it's not very useful because not many people plan their lives that far ahead.
This radio is big and has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite music before you go to sleep and wake up to your favorite song. The radio sounds very good, but it's too big for my bedside table.
Paul liked this radio the most. He said it was the best-looking one and he loved the way it looked. The numbers on the clock are easy to see and the snooze button is big and easy to press. But the buttons are smooth and feel like pebbles, so it's hard not to play with them.
This radio has a special feature that keeps working even if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. But setting it up was a bit tricky. It took us a while to figure it out, but it made us feel smart when we finally did.
Another radio had a built-in lamp, but it was hard to position and didn't shine very well. The light only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul thought the lamp was a good idea, but the radio was hard to tune.
One radio was very colorful and had a fun strap. Tom and I liked it because it didn't get lost on our bedside table. The controls were easy to use, but the alarm was not very accurate. It could go off 10-20 minutes earlier or later than we set it.
The last radio was the simplest and cheapest. It had old-fashioned dial tuning, which Tom liked because it was easy to use. The radio quality was good, and the buzzer worked well.

I met Picasso when I was 18 years old. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco in a van. I was running out of money, so I got a job painting boats on the waterfront. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. I was surprised because he was known to be a private person who liked to stay away from people. I was shy, but my friend encouraged me to go talk to him. I showed him my sketchbook and asked for his signature. He agreed and even drew a picture on the page.
I was so happy that I went back to him and asked if I could draw his portrait. He agreed and started acting silly, making funny faces and poses. I was a bit frustrated because it was hard to draw him, but he was having fun. He even gave me a few serious moments to study his face. I was amazed at how young and strong he looked, even though he was 84 years old.
After I finished drawing, Picasso took the sketchbook and added his own drawing to it. He drew a bearded face that was very different from my drawing. I was surprised and happy that he liked my drawing enough to add to it. I thanked him and asked if he would sign the drawing. He said I already had his signature, so I was happy with that.

Do you ever go to a store and buy more things than you planned? Shops use tricks to make you spend money. Let's talk about some of these tricks.
A. Fresh and nice Supermarkets put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance to make you feel like you're getting something good. They might also put plants or a bakery with yummy smells to make you want to buy more.
B. Where things are placed in the store is important. Supermarkets use computers to see which products people buy most often and put them in easy-to-reach places.
C. Some shops put low-priced items, like bread and tea, far from the entrance. You have to walk past other things you might want to buy on the way.
D. Some shops make their products look special by putting them in special places or using nice displays. This makes you feel like you're getting something special.
E. Food shops put a mix of cheap and expensive things in their stores. They might even sell some things at a loss to get you to come in and buy more.
F. Shops pay attention to prices and make sure they're not too high or too low. They also use prices to make you feel like you're getting a good deal.
G. Shops use lighting to make things look good. They want you to see things clearly and feel like you're getting a good deal.
H. Some shops divide their stores into different areas with different carpets. This makes you follow a path and look at things along the way.
I. When you go into a supermarket, you might see big pictures of food that looks yummy. Some shops even have special carts with screens that show you ads as you shop. This is to make you buy more things on impulse.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a learner of level A1:
Apples have been around for a very long time. People have been eating them for thousands of years. 
Long ago, people in Switzerland and Italy grew apples. They even dried apple halves to eat in the winter. 
In the past, people in Britain grew apples too. They got their knowledge from the Romans. The Romans taught them how to make cider and grow apples. 
In the 13th century, many types of apples grew in Britain. One popular apple was the Old English Pearmain. It was sweet and tasty. 
People took apples with them when they moved to new countries. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. 
In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new type of apple. He named it 'Delicious' because it was so tasty. 
Another famous apple was discovered by a woman named Maria Anne Smith in Australia. She found it growing in a pile of old fruit. She called it 'Granny Smith'. 
Now, apples are grown all over the world. But most apples are the same. This is a problem because it means we don't have many different types of apples. 
We should try to save the different types of apples. We can do this by growing them in our own gardens or by buying them from farmers who grow many different types."

Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He went to a special place in Kenya where the air is thin to train. This place is called Nanyuk. Richard had never trained with Kenyan runners before, but this time he did. He stayed with the Kenyan national team and trained with them. The Kenyans are very good at running. They have a special way of training that helps them. They run a lot, but not too much. They also eat simple food like bread, eggs, and tea. Richard learned that the Kenyans' success is not just because of their genes or where they live. It's because they love running and have a simple way of living. They train hard and eat well, and that's why they are so good at running.

Advertising is not working well. It's not just because of the economic crisis. Advertising started to get worse in 1989, before the crisis even started. The problem is that advertising is not keeping up with the changes in the economy. Advertisers like to think about big groups of people and big media, but now there are many more brands and media options, and target groups are smaller. Even big brands don't usually target the right people.
Think about your own shopping habits. You might buy 30-50 things at the supermarket, but most of these won't be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. You might buy a new car every three years, but not many other things. You don't buy many clothes, and most of them won't be advertised brands.
There are many more brands advertised than people buy. In fact, most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. This is because people only pay attention to a few ads and ignore the rest. Advertising is not very effective, but it can still work if it targets the right people. It's like trying to reach a small group of people in a big crowd. You can't know exactly who will respond to an ad, but you can try to reach more of the right people by being more specific.
Some advertisers think that if they can get 1% of the population to buy their product, they will be very successful. This is a small number of people. The best way to reach them might be to use mass media, but advertising needs to be more targeted than ever before to be effective."

Meet Charles Clover, a man who loves the environment. He visited a special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which is very good for the planet. This house is called the 'autonomous house' and it was designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and they make compost from their sewage. They also heat their house with the heat from their appliances and their own body heat.
The house looks like a normal house from outside, but it's special because it's very well-insulated and quiet. You can't hear anything inside because of the special windows. When you go inside, you have to take off your shoes because it's very quiet. The house is warm in the winter because of the special way it's designed. Robert and Brenda don't use much electricity, and they don't have a big carbon footprint.
The Vales are experts in architecture and they wrote a book about building houses that are good for the environment. They started by designing a house that didn't make any carbon dioxide. Then they thought, ""Why not make it even better?"" They made a house that doesn't use mains water and they made composting toilets. They also have special gutters to make sure the rainwater is clean.
Robert and Brenda don't pay for water and they use very little electricity. They even have solar panels coming soon to make even more electricity. They think that people should live in houses that are good for the environment, but they don't have to live in the dark. They just want to show that it's possible to build a house that is good for the planet without giving up comfort."

'Arthur Conan Doyle, the man who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a smart man. He believed in science. But in 1920, he saw some pictures of fairies taken in a garden.

But later, the two ladies who took the pictures said they were fake. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them in the garden. The pictures are still very pretty. But this trick shows that the camera is not always honest. We can now use computers to change our pictures. It's not true that photography was once completely honest.

Blacksmiths have always been important people. They make things from iron, like tools and weapons. In the past, people thought blacksmiths were special because they could make things that nobody else could. They even made beautiful things for important buildings like churches.
But in the past, many blacksmiths stopped making things because big factories started making iron products instead. Now, people are interested in blacksmiths again because they want unique and beautiful things for their homes. Blacksmiths can now use special tools to make iron work easier and more creative.
There is an exhibition of ironwork by blacksmiths in a gallery in Surrey. The blacksmiths made many different things, like bookends, lamps, and even a spiral staircase. The exhibition will help people see the beauty of ironwork again. The blacksmiths are happy to show their work and make money from it.
Some blacksmiths like working with iron because it is special. It is soft when it is hot, but hard when it is cold. One blacksmith, Susan, says it is like magic. Another blacksmith, Ann, likes that iron is hard and cold and feels like it will last forever.
Iron is a special metal that has been used for a long time. It can be used to make many beautiful things. As long as people like ironwork, it will probably be used for a long time to come."

I stopped smoking. I thought my friends would be happy, but one of my friends was very upset. 'Why did you stop?' she asked. 'If it was easy, why didn't you stop a long time ago?' I couldn't explain why I suddenly stopped. I went to a special session to help people stop smoking. It was a group therapy session with hypnotherapy. I didn't want to stop smoking, but I went to write an article about other people who were trying to stop.
I didn't think it would work for me because I loved smoking. It made me happy. But something strange happened. When I was told to smoke, I didn't want to. And neither did the others. Maybe it was because we realized that stopping smoking was a big achievement. It made me feel strong. It was a secret feeling that only I knew.
It was easy to stop smoking. The desire for nicotine went away after a few minutes. I was surprised that I could still work without cigarettes. But I found it hard to do nothing at home on weekends. I think I smoked to have something to do. I miss cigarettes a little bit, but not too much. Now, I have to find new things to do in situations where I used to smoke, like when I'm waiting for a plane or in a hotel.'"

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for an A1 level learner:
Do you know Dorothy Hodgkin? She was a very important British scientist who won a Nobel prize. But many people in Britain don't know about her. I have been asking my friends about her, and most of them don't know who she is. This is strange, because she was the only British woman to win a Nobel prize in science. 
Dorothy Hodgkin was a very special person. She was a scientist who studied crystals. Her life was interesting because she lived through many big changes in the world, like women getting more education and science becoming global. 
When I started writing her biography, I read other scientific biographies. I was surprised that there weren't many books about famous scientists like Linus Pauling. He was a friend of Dorothy's and worked in the same field. 
Some scientists think that writing about scientists is boring. But I think that's not true. Scientists are people too, and they have interesting stories. 
Dorothy Hodgkin was a very good scientist. She solved many problems in science, like finding the structure of penicillin and insulin. She also had a family and was married to a historian. 
Her personal life is not directly related to her work, but we can learn from how she balanced her work and family life. There is much in her life that is interesting to everyone, not just scientists. 
The problem is that many people don't understand science. It's not because science is hard, but because people don't make an effort to learn. We should learn about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin and appreciate their work."

Margaret Wilkins has a special way of finding water. She can hold a special stick and feel where water is underground. Many farmers come to her because their wells have dried up. She and her husband have a business that drills wells. But when they need to find water, Margaret uses her special stick.
This special way of finding water is called dowsing. There are many theories about how it works. Some people think it's because everything in the world vibrates, and Margaret can feel these vibrations. Others think it's because she has a special sense that helps her find water.
Margaret has been very busy lately because there has been a big drought. Many farmers have come to her to find water for their wells. She tries to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She has to make sure the water is safe and clean.
Margaret uses a special tool called a pendulum to help her find water. She also uses a forked stick. When she holds the stick over the ground and there is water below, the stick starts to move. She uses this to find the exact spot where they should drill the well.
Margaret's husband also uses the same method, but sometimes they don't agree on the exact spot. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they do. Margaret says it's like having an ""intuitive perception of the environment"". This means she has a special way of understanding the world around her.
Margaret's special way of finding water has helped her and her husband have a successful business. They have been doing this for many years, and people come to them from all over to find water."

**Being a Good Leader**
What makes a good leader? A good leader is someone who inspires others and helps them work together. It's not about being tall or smart. A good leader should be able to speak clearly and make people feel excited about working together.
John van Maurik, a director, says that most people have the potential to be leaders. We just need to find our talents and use them. We can all be leaders in our own way.
When we think about our bosses, we might remember the ones who made us feel motivated and supported. Those are the good leaders. They make us feel important and help us work together.
Leaders and managers are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders make their own way. A good leader can make a big difference in a company or team.
**How to Be a Better Leader**
If you want to be a better leader, try these things:
* Find what you're passionate about and lead with that.
* Think of yourself as a leader and believe in yourself.
* Sometimes, you need to take charge and make decisions. Try different ways of leading and see what works best.
* Set goals and work to achieve them.
* Learn to delegate tasks and motivate others.
* Practice your communication skills so that others understand you.
* Don't be afraid to take risks and learn from your mistakes.
* Be visible and accessible to those who need your help.
Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know when you can help others become leaders too."

Newspapers might disappear one day. Some people are happy about this, but others are worried. Change can be scary. But transition means moving from one place to another, like moving from a paper newspaper to a digital one. However, newspapers are not always easy to change. They might not be able to change at all.
Many people think that newspapers will soon stop printing and only be online. But the numbers don't always add up. Some newspapers are still selling a lot of copies, and some people are still reading them. In fact, some newspapers are even selling more copies now than they were before.
Newspapers are not the only thing that is changing. Magazines and books are also changing. Some people are reading more books on their tablets and phones, but they are still buying physical books too. It's not one or the other, it's both.
Some people think that young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but that's not true. Many young people still read newspapers. In some countries, like Germany and France, newspaper sales are not dropping as much as they are in other countries.
Newspapers are trying to make money online, but it's not easy. They are trying different things, like asking people to pay for their online content. Some newspapers are also selling their print and online content together, which seems to work better.
Newspapers are important, and they will probably continue to be important. They will just change and adapt to the way people read and use technology."

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects. When someone is in a picture, it's usually more interesting than a picture without them. But people can be hard to photograph well. We need to think about how they are standing, what they are doing, and how they are feeling.
**Taking Pictures of Groups**
When taking pictures of a group, try not to have everyone stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel down.
**Posing for Pictures**
When someone is taking a picture, they often don't act naturally. They might stiffen up and look uncomfortable. Try to make them feel relaxed by suggesting they put their hands in their pockets or fold their arms.
**Taking a Good Picture**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can make people feel uncomfortable. Most people are happy to have their picture taken and might even be flattered. But they might feel self-conscious, so you might need to direct them.
**Looking at the Camera**
A good picture is when the person in the picture looks directly at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. This will make the picture more interesting.
**Candid Shots**
Another way to take a good picture is to have the person focus on something in the picture. This can make the picture more interesting and make it look like you are observing them without noticing.
**Expressions and Gestures**
The way someone looks and what they do with their body can tell us a lot about them. A happy child can make us smile, while a sad expression can make us feel sorry for them. Look for familiar expressions like smiling, winking, or frowning.
**Background and Environment**
When taking pictures, think about the background and what it says about the person. Try to make the background not too distracting and make sure the person is not overwhelmed by it.
**Interaction**
When taking pictures of people interacting, like talking or laughing, it can make for a good picture. Look for contact between the people, like eye contact or physical touch.
**People and Places**
When taking pictures of people in a place, like on holiday, try to show them against the background. Ask them to come close to the camera and make sure the group is in the foreground.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Think about why you want to take the picture. If you want a good clear picture, ask the person to pose. But if you want a more natural picture, try to take it when they are not expecting it."

In the past, people were judged by how smart they were and how well they did in school. But now, people are judged by how well they work with others and how they handle their emotions. This is important because it helps us know who will be good at their job and who might not be. 
Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control our own feelings and the feelings of others. It's like having good ""people skills"". We need these skills to work well with others and to be good at our jobs. 
Some people think emotional intelligence means being nice all the time, but it's not just about being nice. It's about being able to control our feelings so we can work well with others. 
More and more companies are realizing that emotional intelligence is important. They want their employees to be able to work well together and to be good with customers. This is especially important in jobs that are complex and require teamwork. 
The good news is that emotional intelligence can be learned and improved as we grow and learn from our experiences. It's like getting more mature and wise. This is important because jobs are not always stable, and we need to be able to adapt and work well with others to succeed.'

""Should the media use pictures they didn't take? With phones, it's easy to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed the way people share news. Journalists now get pictures from social media when big events happen. But some journalists use pictures without asking the person who took them. This is a problem. Some people think it's okay to use pictures without permission if it's very important or if many people are interested. But others think it's not right. Many people would take pictures of news events, so this type of picture is important for the media. To keep the relationship between the media and the public good, the media should make sure to ask permission and give credit to the people who take the pictures."""

Acupuncture is an old medicine from China. It's over 2,000 years old! It's used to help people feel better from different kinds of pain. Some doctors in the West use it to help their patients.
Acupuncture is based on an old Chinese idea. They think that our bodies have energy, like a special kind of air, called Qi. This Qi flows through our bodies along special paths. When the flow of Qi is blocked, we can get sick or feel pain.
When you go to an acupuncturist, they will feel your pulse, look at your tongue, and ask you questions about your health. They will put very thin needles into your skin to help the Qi flow again. This can help you feel better from pain.
There are many points on the body where the needles can be put. It might feel a little strange, but it's not painful. Some people feel a tingling sensation when the needle is moved.
Doctors in the West don't always understand how acupuncture works, but they know it can help with pain. Some scientists think it might work by blocking pain signals to the brain or releasing special pain-relieving chemicals.
Acupuncture can help with many kinds of pain, like back pain, headaches, and arthritis. Some people even use it to help with pain during surgery. It's a special kind of anesthesia that doesn't have bad side effects.
Not everyone finds acupuncture helpful, but many people do. It's a different way of thinking about health and pain. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They want to know what's causing the pain and how to make it better.
Some doctors learn acupuncture in a traditional way, while others don't believe in the old Chinese ideas. But many acupuncturists think that's what makes it work best. When choosing an acupuncturist, make sure they are good and refer you to a doctor if you need to."

The way we write can tell us a lot about a person. Some people think that handwriting can show if someone is healthy or not. It can even show if someone is good at a job or not. In some countries, people use handwriting to help decide who to hire for a job. Handwriting analysis is a special way of looking at how people write to learn more about them.
Patricia Marne is a expert in handwriting analysis. She says that handwriting can show if someone is smart or not, if they are good at art or science, and even if they are honest or not. She thinks that handwriting can help find out if someone is likely to do something bad or not. She says that some people who do bad things have handwriting that is not good.
Patricia Marne says that handwriting can also show if someone is sick or not. She says that some people who are sick may write in a special way. She also says that handwriting can show if someone is happy or sad.
Some doctors and psychiatrists do not believe in handwriting analysis. They think that handwriting is just a way to write and does not say anything about a person."

Is your office happy and healthy? A new survey says that fresh air and good chairs are important. We visited four different offices to see how happy and healthy they are. We had experts with us: a building expert, an ergonomist, and a psychologist.
Office A: Advertising Agency
The building expert said this office is very simple. There is no heating or air conditioning, and the windows open onto the street. But the people who work here are happy. They open the doors and windows to make it comfortable. This might be because they are a small team and don't have to follow strict rules.
The ergonomist said the chairs are old and not good for working. But the people work in different ways, so they don't get bored or tired.
The psychologist said the office is small but nice. People like working here because they can focus on their own work.
Office B: News Service
The building expert said this office is comfortable and clean. There is no smoking allowed. The ergonomist said the chairs are good, but the office is a bit boring. The psychologist said the staff are happy, but the office could be better if they could share information more easily.
Office C: Bank
The building expert said this office is mixed. Some people like it, some don't. The air is good, even near the smokers. The ergonomist said the office is boring, but the chairs are okay. The psychologist said the staff are friendly and like working together.
Office D: Newspaper
The building expert said this office is not good. The air is hot or cold, and it's dusty. The ergonomist said the chairs are old and bad for working. The psychologist said the office is dirty and needs to be cleaned. The staff seem stressed and unhappy.

Chewing gum is popular and Americans use 12 million sticks every day. Let's learn about how chewing gum became a big business. Chewing gum has very few calories, but it's still considered a food. That's why it has to follow special rules from the American Food and Drug Administration.
A long time ago, people chewed a special kind of gum made from the bark of a tree called the mastic tree. Greek women liked to chew this gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American settlers also chewed a type of gum that came from spruce trees.
In the 1800s, people in the eastern United States started selling lumps of spruce gum. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the country. Later, people found a new kind of gum called chicle, which came from a special tree in Central America. This gum was softer and more fun to chew.
Today, most chewing gum is made from synthetic materials. This means it's not made from natural things like trees. Some people still collect chicle from the trees, but it's hard work. They have to climb the trees and carry the liquid down to a camp to make the gum.
Chewing gum is popular because it's good for your teeth. It can help remove plaque and acid from your mouth. Some people think chewing gum can even help you relax and feel less stressed. There are many different flavors and textures of gum now, and people are always trying to come up with new ideas.

But Sue was not happy when she arrived. The receptionist didn't say hello or help her. Sue said, ""This is not good.""
The hotel had some problems. The door to the car park was not working, and the corridor was long and dark. When Sue got to the reception, the receptionist said they didn't have her booking. Sue was not happy. She found out that many rooms were empty, and one room was not good because it was stuffy and had a hole in the wall.
The next morning, Sue talked to the hotel manager, Robin Greaves. He apologized for the bad smell in the lounge. Sue said it was not good, but she also said some things were good, like the assistant manager Emma and the waitress Trudy. The food was also good.
Sue told Greaves what he needed to do to make the hotel better. She said, ""Don't serve a pudding that falls apart."" Greaves asked how to get three stars, and Sue said, ""Be more careful."" She also said she would write a report about the hotel.

Susan Shepherd is a famous artist who paints flowers. She lives in a house with a big garden that has many of her favorite flowers, like tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wild and spread all over the garden. There are two long flower beds along a path in the garden. The garden is very colorful and pretty because the previous owners were good gardeners. Susan inherited the gardener, Danny, who helps her take care of the garden.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. She picks a flower, paints it, and then brings another one to her studio to paint. Sometimes it takes a long time to finish a painting. In the spring and summer, she is very busy because many flowers bloom at the same time.
Susan has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers when she was a child. She likes how they grow in strange places, like cracks in rocks. Now, she has many plants from faraway places in her garden. She likes to let the children play in the garden, as long as they don't hurt anything. Right now, she is very busy preparing for two art exhibitions and taking care of her garden. She has hired an extra gardener to help her, but she knows it's important to get her hands dirty to stay connected to her art.

We lived in a valley for 16 months. We thought we were safe. But then the storms came early. It was before winter, even before November. The snow was deep and blocked our path. We were worried because the river, the Ryburn, could flood. It reminded us of what happened many years ago when the river flowed freely. 
The snow started to melt, and we saw big, grey clouds in the sky. We watched the river every day. It was getting fuller and wilder. The snow was going away, and more rain was coming from the clouds. We were worried because the water was rising too high. 
Then, the reservoir in the hills overflowed. The water poured down the stream, and the river was very deep near our home. We were scared, but the dam held, and the water went back down. We were lucky. 
In the past, the river flooded the villages. But now, the dam helps us. We can enjoy the big clouds and the river's power. We feel safe in our valley.

Do you know why a schoolgirl would want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? It's because it's fun! A teenager who loves sports is looking for a training partner, preferably a girl. You will work with a potential Olympic champion. You must like long runs (15 kilometers), swimming long distances (swimming in cold rivers is good), and cycling long distances (loving 10-kilometer rides is a plus). You must be able to do all three without resting.
Triathlons are a popular sport. People are amazed and a little scared when athletes swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. But what makes these athletes do this? And why does a 17-year-old girl with good grades give up everything for this?
Melanie Sears is a 17-year-old girl who loves triathlons. She says, ""You swim 1500 meters, then get out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, you get cold. After the 40-kilometer bike ride, you have to run 10 kilometers, which is a long way when you're tired. But it's fun, and it's worth it in the end.""
Melanie started doing triathlons when she was 14. She won the junior section, but then she was the only junior competing. She was so confident that she entered the national championships, but she didn't do well. She got lost during the competition and cycled 20 kilometers too far. She cried during the running part. But she didn't give up.
Sometimes Melanie wants to stop because it hurts, but she's afraid that if she stops once, she will want to do it again. Her coach, Steve Trew, says, ""I've been testing her fitness, and she worked so hard on the treadmill that it finally stopped working and threw her into a wall. She gave it her all, but most people would stop when they can't go any further. She just kept going.""
Melanie was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships this year. She's working hard to improve her cycling. She wants to buy a new bike that costs £2,000, but her parents will have to pay for it. Her training sessions are very hard and have made her a bit lonely. She doesn't have a social life, but she talks to her friends on the phone and writes to them."

I like collecting things. Many people do. Collecting is a fun hobby. It's a world of excitement and joy. But remember, if you don't love something, don't collect it. People have been collecting things for a long time. A long time ago, people collected stones and shells because they were pretty. I have been collecting things all my life. I collect flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was little, my parents took me to a museum. I saw many old things there. I liked them. Many people like collecting things. One in three adults collect something. Some people collect because it's the only thing they can control. I just like collecting. A long time ago, a king in France had a special room with many strange things. Another queen in Russia had over 4,000 paintings. You don't need to be rich to collect things. I have collected many things, like tulip bulbs and cups. I even found a special doll in the United States. But sometimes, things get lost or broken. A fire once destroyed my collection of dolls. I was sad. What I like most about collecting is when people trade things. A spoon that once belonged to a king is special. This is why some things become valuable. Old toys from the 1950s are now valuable if you still have the boxes. I made a mistake and threw away my toys and their boxes.

But not everyone gets help from careers advice. Amanda Margetts, 24, went to a careers adviser. She was unhappy and wanted new ideas. The adviser gave her many ideas, but she did not like them. She thought a friend would have given her the same advice."

'Fun at the Dentist's?
W. Lloyd Jerome is a dentist in Glasgow. His dental surgery is modern and nice. He wants to make people feel comfortable when they come to see him. He says that many people only go to the dentist when they have a problem with their teeth. They might be scared.
Jerome wants to change this. He has made his surgery feel more like a relaxing place. He doesn't wear a white coat, which some people might find scary. He wants people to feel at ease.
One of his new ideas is using special headsets that show movies. Patients can watch a film while he checks their teeth. It's like going on a virtual trip!
The surgery also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Jerome wants people to feel happy and not scared when they come in.
He is a serious dentist, but he also wants to make sure his patients are comfortable. He uses special tools to clean teeth, which don't hurt.
Jerome went to the United States to learn new ways to help his patients. He thinks that if he makes his patients happy, he will be happy too. He wants to make dentistry more friendly and less formal in the UK.
One of his patients comes in, and Jerome offers him a cup of tea and asks what movie he wants to watch. The patient seems happy and relaxed. Jerome's surgery is like a nice beauty salon, not a normal dentist's office.'

Chocolate is a popular food all over the world. In Britain, people buy a lot of chocolate at Easter. They spend over £230 million on it! This is a big part of the chocolate industry, which is a big business.
Chocolate has been around for a very long time. The Aztecs and Mayans in Central America grew a special tree called the cacao tree over 3,000 years ago. The fruit of the tree has 20-40 seeds inside. When the seeds are dried, they become cacao beans. These beans can be used to make chocolate.
The Aztecs used cacao beans as money and to make a special drink called xocoatl. This drink was bitter and was used for special occasions. The Spanish liked it better when they added sugar and cinnamon. Chocolate houses were popular in Europe, where people went to drink chocolate.
A long time ago, chocolate was hard and had to be melted in hot water. But then someone invented chocolate powder, and that made it easier to make chocolate. In 1847, a company in Bristol made a solid chocolate bar that you could eat. Later, milk was added to the chocolate, and that's how milk chocolate was born.
Now, there are many chocolate companies in Britain. Some of them make special chocolate bars, like Cadbury's Dairy Milk. People like to eat chocolate, and it's a big part of British culture. But some chocolate farmers are having trouble because the price of cocoa beans went down a lot. Maybe you can think about them next time you eat a chocolate bar."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who likes to spend time at the bottom of the ocean. She teaches and does research about the ocean's chemistry. She works at a university in Southampton.
When she's not teaching, Rachel goes down to the ocean floor in a special vehicle. It's like a small car that can take her down 3 kilometers to the ocean floor. She studies underwater volcanoes. The space inside the vehicle is small, so she can touch the pilots who are with her.
The dive can take 16 hours. It takes 3 hours to get to the ocean floor, 10 hours to collect samples, and 3 hours to come back up. If something goes wrong, Rachel can press a button to get out quickly.
Rachel has made 6 dives. She once went on a dive with a Russian team to a place with many underwater volcanoes. They were studying a volcano to see what would happen if they made a hole 150 meters deep.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the university. She loves teaching, but she does it so she can do her research on underwater volcanoes. She calls them ""black smokers"" because hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke.
Rachel has been scared only once, when there was an explosion while she was diving with an American team. They were surprised to be alive after that.
Rachel loves going to the deepest part of the ocean. She feels amazing when she sees the underwater volcanoes for the first time. She studied them for 3 years for her PhD, and it was an incredible feeling to see them for real."

But the next year, I did it again. And the year after that. With an Inter-Rail ticket, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month. I could sleep on the train and carry all my things in a backpack. This made me think differently about travel. I didn't need to worry about much. I could just go and see new places. My friends and I went to France and then kept going to other countries. We didn't plan much, we just went. We saw the view from the train station and had a good time. Travel is exciting when you see a place for the first time. It's like it didn't exist before you saw it. Seeing Europe with your own eyes is the best way to understand it. This is what makes other people's holiday photos boring. The train trip is a special experience.

""When you travel, it's not nice to find out that your suitcase is not on the plane. You might have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your luggage. This can happen if you are in a different country and it's not the right weather for the clothes you have. Airlines don't always tell us how many suitcases they lose, but it's true that sometimes they make mistakes. Even good airlines can make mistakes. The problem is that it's hard to guarantee that your suitcase will be on the same plane as you, especially if you have a long trip with many stops. 
The airline has rules to help prevent this. They want you to arrive at the airport early so your suitcase can get to the plane on time. They also have rules for how long you have to wait between flights. But sometimes, there are problems like traffic jams or delays, and this can cause the airline to lose your suitcase. 
There are some airports that are very big and busy, and it's more likely to lose your suitcase there. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline and get to the airport early. You can also label your suitcase inside and out with your name and address, and include the flight numbers. If your suitcase still doesn't show up, you need to tell the airline staff at the baggage area and fill out a special form before you leave the airport.""

Kingfishers are special birds. In old stories, they are said to be connected to the moon and the sun. This is because their feathers shine in the light and look like the sky and the sun. Charlie likes to take pictures of kingfishers because they are so beautiful. He likes to hide behind a blanket or a tree to take pictures of them.
Charlie used to miss school to take pictures of kingfishers. He didn't do well in school, but he loved taking pictures of the birds.

Fun Island - The Burns Family
We went to a theme park called Fun Island. We thought it might not be as good as the big theme park we visited in the US last year. But we were surprised! The park is good for young children. Our three-year-old had a great time on the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's a special ride for little kids, and the older kids liked the scarier rides like Splash Out.
The only thing we didn't like was that the park doesn't have a lot of decorations. But the staff were very helpful and the park was clean and well-organized.

The National Trust helps take care of the countryside in England. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and met Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust. He takes care of the beautiful areas owned by the Trust.
Gareth says you need to be sensible and good with people to be a warden. You need to work with farmers, visitors, and builders. Gareth grew up on a farm and worked there until he got married. He applied for the job as a warden and got it because of his local knowledge and farming experience.
Gareth is good at his job because he still works on his parents' farm. This helps him understand the problems of farmers and can talk to them easily. He also knows how to do physical work like building fences and planting trees.
Gareth used to like picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was a child. Now he understands how farming can affect the countryside. He says farmers and people who want to protect nature used to argue, but now they are talking and understanding each other.
Gareth's job is to make sure things get done, like planting trees and meeting with farmers. He likes seeing projects finished and talking to the public. But sometimes he gets annoyed with people who don't respect the land and the work he does.
If you like the outdoors and have common sense, you might like to work as a warden like Gareth. But it's a tough job, and it might take a long time to get a job like this."

**Special Music Schools**
Some children are very good at music. But it's not always easy to help them grow and develop their talent. Parents might not notice their child's special ability until they get frustrated and behave badly. Regular schools are good for kids who are good at other subjects, but music schools are special for kids who are very good at music.
There are five special music schools in Britain. They help children aged 7-18 to learn music with professional musicians. These schools are small and have a good teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they are with other kids who like music too.
Some people might think that these schools are not good because they are expensive (around £12,000-£17,000 per year). But the schools try to help parents who can't afford the fees. Another problem is that some parents don't want their children to live away from home at a young age.
Some people think that taking children out of school at a young age can cause stress. Children might lose their musical talent, and the pressure to be good can make them feel bad. But the music schools keep an eye on each child and help them if they need it.
Many people who went to these schools say they learned a lot and loved the music teachers. But some people think that the schools should also teach more subjects, not just music. Some children are very good at both music and other subjects, and they might do well in a regular school with a good music department or by taking music lessons on the weekends.

Do you want to publish your story? Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many people write to us and ask, ""Where should I send my story?"" First, you need to learn about the market and find the right publishers. You also need to practice your writing. To know what kind of writing publishers want, read many books and magazines. Go to your local library and bookstore. Reading will help you understand what publishers are looking for. Remember, new books and magazines come out all the time, so you need to keep learning.
If you want to write love stories, find out which magazines publish them. Get some recent copies and see what kind of stories they like. Think about who their readers are and what they want to read.
Some people send me their stories and ask if they are good enough. As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But usually, the work is not ready for publication. Most new writers send their work too soon. If you only write one story, it's unlikely to be published. Successful writers often have experience in writing or journalism before they become famous.
When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories. Each one will be better than the last. Don't give up! Join a writing group or take a creative writing course to help you improve. Remember, every successful writer has had many rejections before they succeed. Keep writing and practicing every day."

Dolphins are very smart and can understand human emotions. We like to imagine them swimming freely in the ocean. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest have made dolphins popular. However, these shows don't show the real life of dolphins in the sea.
The North Sea has lost many harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin. There are 40 different kinds of dolphins in the world. Some dolphins live far out in the sea and we don't know much about them. Others, like the bottlenose dolphin, used to live near European coasts. Now, they are only found in a few places and are sick.
Dolphins have a hard time finding food because there are too many fishing nets in the sea. These nets can hurt or trap dolphins. They can also eat bad things like pesticides, which can make them sick. Even their mothers can pass these bad things to their babies through their milk.
The noise from ships, oil wells, and other things in the sea can also disturb dolphins. We don't know exactly how, but it might be very bad for them.
We should take care of dolphins and protect them. They are very special animals and we love them.'"

Exercise is good for our body and mind. It helps us feel better and stay healthy. We should exercise to stay fit and strong. Exercise can help us in many ways. It makes our muscles stronger and our body look better. It also helps us sleep better and feel less tired. Exercise can even help us feel less stressed and anxious.
There are many types of exercise we can do. We can do aerobics, jogging, or lift weights. But we should start slowly and carefully. We should also listen to our body and take breaks when we need to.
Good posture is important too. It helps us look and feel better. We should stand up straight and lift our chest up. This will help us breathe better and look slimmer.
Stretching is also important. It helps us move easily and prevents injuries. We should stretch four or five times a week. We should also do a warm-up, a workout, and a cool-down.
Remember, exercise is good for us. It helps us feel better and stay healthy. We should make exercise a part of our daily routine."

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She studies the ocean and the things that happen in it. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on special underwater adventures. She wears a special suit and gets in a small vehicle that takes her down to the ocean floor. It's like a small car, but it's for underwater exploration.
It takes her three hours to get down to the ocean floor. Then she stays there for ten hours, collecting rocks and water. After that, she comes back up to the surface. If something goes wrong, she has a special button she can press to get out quickly.
Rachel has made six underwater trips. She's been to a place called the Atlantic Ocean, where there are big underwater volcanoes. She's also worked with a team from Russia. They were studying the volcanoes and how they affect the ocean.
When Rachel is not on an adventure, she works in her office at the university. She teaches and does research. She loves her job because it lets her study the ""black smokers"", which are underwater volcanoes that make black smoke.
Rachel has been a little scared sometimes. Once, there was a big explosion while she was underwater, and she thought it was the end. But it wasn't, and she was relieved to be alive.
Rachel loves her job because it's like an adventure. She gets to see things that no one else has seen before. She feels happy and excited when she sees the underwater volcanoes."

First impressions are important. People make judgments about us in just a few minutes. They notice how we look, how we talk, and how we move. Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard and got her degree. She went to an interview at a school, but she didn't get the job. The teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take care of themselves, they won't be a good teacher.""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who take care of themselves are more likely to care about their job. But many people don't think about how they look. Janet Goodwood worked in an office for ten years, but she didn't get a promotion because she didn't dress well.
Body language is also important. A psychologist found that most of what we say comes from our face and body. When our words and body language don't match, it can be confusing. Sheila Rice got a job offer, but she was too excited and the boss offered her a lower salary.
It's also important to know what to say and how to say it. David Artesio says it's a good idea to learn about the company before the interview. You can find this information in the company's report. Marian Woodall says it's good to have a few questions ready and to speak in short sentences.

**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
Darius (runner) I like sports. I played many games, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a big football team, but I chose to focus on running instead. My biggest moment was when I ran for my country and got a medal. It was nice, but not many people knew about it. I train at home in the winter and then go to a special place for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun, but I have to say no to my friends when they want to go out at night. I want to be a professional runner and go to the Olympics one day.
Gabriel (surfer) I like surfing. There are not many surfers, so I see the same people everywhere. We have to be serious and wake up early to catch the best waves. I don't like giving up my sleep, but it's worth it because I won a big competition last year. I like to celebrate with my friends after a win, and sometimes we go on a nice trip. It's okay to sacrifice some things to be a good surfer.
Dieter (yacht racer) We have a lot of fun on our boat. We like to celebrate when we win, but we don't try to be famous. Sometimes the reporters ask us about where we go out and what we do, but we just want to have fun. I'm away from home for a long time, so it's nice to come back and do normal things with my friends. I'm known in the sailing world, but not many people recognize me on the street. I like getting letters from fans and always reply to them.
Tomas (tennis player) It's great to play tennis and feel like the crowd is cheering for me. Sometimes it gets crazy, but I like being recognized by fans when I'm out and about. However, it can be hard to deal with. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from other fans. As a tennis player, I have to travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It's hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports. I'm happy to focus on my game now and do other things when I retire."

Shopping with children can be very difficult. They always want to buy something new. Sometimes it's a special breakfast cereal, a Disney video, or a comic. Parents often can't afford all these things. If they say yes, they feel guilty because they think they're buying too many unhealthy things. If they say no, they feel bad because they're not letting their children make their own choices. Parents try to avoid taking their children shopping, but then they worry that they're not teaching their children how to make good choices.
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they're in the supermarket. Many companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want. They think the advertisements are very convincing.
Some parents are worried about what their children eat and want to teach them about healthy food. But children only hear the advertisements and don't get the whole story. Parents feel bad because they're competing with the advertisements and can't always say yes to their children's requests.
Some parents feel stressed when they're shopping with their children because they have to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother said she talks to her son about food and labels, and he's learned to be critical of advertisements. Now they don't argue much when they're shopping.
Parents also admit that they're not always consistent in what they say yes or no to their children. One father said they don't buy his son sweets because they're bad for him, but they buy other treats for themselves. He feels bad because he's not being fair.
Supermarkets could make shopping easier for parents by moving sweets to a different part of the store or providing a play area for children. This might make parents happy and want to shop there more often."

Ice Skating
Ice skating is very old. People used animal bones to make skates a long time ago. Later, people used iron to make skates. In some countries, skating was very important for rich people. 
A long time ago, skating was only for special people. But a girl named Sonja Henie changed that. She skated at the Olympics when she was 11 years old. She showed everyone that skating could be fun and exciting. 
Now, people skate for fun and exercise. It's good for your body and mind. To start skating, you need to stand with your feet close together and your knees bent. You need to bend your legs and keep your body straight. 
It's important to relax while you skate. If you're tense, you might fall. But don't worry, falling is okay. Just get up and try again. 
There are different ways to skate, like figure skating and speed skating. But first, you need to learn how to skate properly. You can take lessons at an ice rink near you. 
Skating is good for your body. It helps you balance and move. It's also good for your heart and lungs. You can even do other exercises like swimming or jogging to stay healthy."

Do you know how tall you are? Chris Greener, a man from Britain, is the tallest person in his country. He is 228 cm tall! Many years ago, people were also very tall. In fact, our ancestors were even taller than us. This is because they ate food from nature, like fruits, vegetables, and animals. They didn't eat just one type of food like we do today.
Many years ago, people started to grow crops instead of hunting and gathering. This was a big change. Now, most people eat just three types of food: wheat, rice, and maize. This has made us shorter and less healthy. 
In the past, when people ate a variety of foods, they were healthier and taller. But now, we are getting taller again because we have better food. In some countries, like the US, Japan, and Holland, people are getting taller. 
But there is a problem. We can't keep getting taller forever. We need to stop growing at some point. Scientists think we might stop growing at around 193 cm. However, they also think that as a species, we might get smaller because of the warm weather. 
Let me know if you'd like me to make any further adjustments!"

I went to a TV show and talked to some people in the audience. They told me they liked being there because it was exciting and fun. They got to see things that they wouldn't see if they were just watching at home. One person said it was more exciting than watching at home because they got to see their favorite comedian live.
I didn't think it was exciting, though. I was sitting far away and could only see the back of someone's head. But for most people, it was just a fun night out. They didn't care that it wasn't the best way to watch TV. They just enjoyed being there.

I like taking a special train from Hythe to Dungeness. It's not very expensive and I like looking at the countryside. The train goes through fields and alongside a canal. Sometimes we pass through people's backyards and I get to see what they're doing.
I like the coast of Hartland Peninsula. The beaches are hard to get to, so there are not many people. It's a good place to relax and enjoy the sea. There are nice walks and you can go inland to see beautiful valleys with oak trees and flowers.
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a big open area with no people and no buildings. I like the feeling of space and freedom. I go there every year and it's special because I can be with my family.
I bought a house in England called Glenthorne. It's a peaceful place where I can relax and feel connected to my roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in England when I was 12.

""Climbing is a popular sport. People used to climb mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, inside or outside. A big crowd is watching. High up on the wall, a French climber named Francois is hanging upside down. He's competing in a big climbing competition at a big indoor arena in Birmingham.
The indoor arena is famous for a TV show called Gladiators. But both the TV show and the climbing competition have something in common - The Wall. This is because of a new technology that makes it possible to build climbing walls anywhere.
Before, climbers used to climb on cliffs. But this wasn't always possible. In the winter, they would get cold or go for a walk instead. Some climbers used to climb on snow and ice in Scotland. But as climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit all year round. So, they started using brick edges and stone buildings to practice.
Many sports centers built walls for climbing. These walls had special edges to hold onto. A teacher named Don Robinson built the first climbing wall in a school corridor. He had the idea to put real rocks in a block of concrete. Many walls were built like this in the 1970s. But they had some problems. They could only be built straight up and down, not like the cliffs outside. Climbers got bored with the same old holds.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois developed a special material that could be molded into shapes like the rocks on the cliffs. These shapes could be put on any wall and taken off when climbers got bored. French companies also made panels that could be attached to a steel frame. This made it possible to build walls with overhangs and angles. Climbers could use different holds every time they climbed."""

Do you want to be an actor? If you say this, people might tell you it's a risky job. And it is! There are many people who want to be actors, but not enough jobs for all of them.

You can't just take a test and get the job. It's about being lucky and having talent. 
But there are always new opportunities and chances to be discovered. People are always looking for new faces and new talent. And sometimes, being an actor can be exciting and fun. 
So, why do people want to be actors? It's hard to explain. But for many, it's about that special moment when they're on stage and the audience is watching. This is what makes acting special, no matter where it happens. 
Actors often don't know why they're good at their job. They just know certain things about themselves and how to do things. But they never take anything for granted. They know they're only as good as their next job, and they might not be famous forever. 
Actors don't like to talk about their chances of getting a part. They try to protect themselves from the stress of trying out for a job and getting rejected. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, this can happen from the very beginning of their career.

People in Europe are getting taller. Every year, more people are born who are very tall. But this doesn't mean we are making a new super race. We are going back to how people were a long time ago. Our ancestors used to eat many different foods, like fruits and berries. They got their food from nature. But then, people started to grow crops and this changed everything.
Eating the same foods every day made people unhealthy and short. In one place, people were healthy and strong when they ate wild foods, but when they started eating corn, they became sick and weak. This was a big problem.
Now, some countries are eating better and people are getting taller again. In the US, the average person is 179 cm tall. In Holland, it's 180 cm, and in Japan, it's 177 cm. This is good news, but it also means that we need to make bigger beds and clothes.
But scientists think that we might not get any taller. We might even get smaller because of the heat. A long time ago, people were bigger and round because it was cold. Now that it's warmer, we are getting smaller. We might get even smaller as the planet gets warmer.

Colin and his wife planted many trees and flowers. They chose plants that can grow well in this place, near the sea. Some plants even came from far away, like Canada and New Zealand!
The models in the village were made by Colin himself. He made over 100 models over nine years. He used different materials like stone, concrete, and wood to make them strong. He had to learn how to make them strong and weather-resistant.
The models are very detailed and look very real. Colin was very patient and learned new ways to make them. The village is very popular and people come from all around to see it.
You can walk around the village and see many things, like a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models. You can take pictures from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.
If you press the buttons in front of some of the models, they will work. We would like to hear your comments and ideas. We are always making new models and want to know what you think. We hope you have a nice time and will come back again soon!"

Some newspapers in the UK print pictures that hurt people's feelings and break the rules. Celebrities usually don't want to be photographed when they're private. But sometimes, pictures of famous people are published without their permission. This can cause a lot of trouble. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) is supposed to help with these problems, but it doesn't often do anything.
A famous actress was photographed on her hotel balcony. She was upset because she felt it was private. The PCC didn't investigate. The PCC should look into another problem too - a story about a pop star's personal life. The pop star didn't complain, but the PCC should have taken action.
The PCC could take pictures of famous people, but it would be very hard to decide what to do. It would also cause trouble for the newspapers and photographers. Celebrities might not want to complain because it would be embarrassing. They might also be worried that the PCC would find another secret story about them.
A comedian and his wife were photographed on their honeymoon. He didn't complain because he was worried that the newspaper would make fun of him again. People are scared to complain because they think the newspapers will get them again.
It's hard to find a solution to this problem."

When you finish college, many people look for a second job. This text is not about people who look for a temporary job while they are still looking for a permanent one. It's not about people who leave a job after just a few weeks because it's not good. This text is about people who want to take a big step in their career. They have some experience, skills, and know what they want to do.
What kind of job should you look for? It depends on what you want to do in the future. Do you want to work in a specific area or move to a bigger job with more responsibility? You should think carefully about your second job. You should stay in it for two to three years. This job will help you get your next job.
When you apply for your next job, they will look at your second job very closely. It should show that you have a plan for your career. It should also help you grow and give you more responsibility.
If you love to travel, now is the time to do it. You can work temporarily when you get back and then get your second job. Employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and won't want to leave again.
Juliette worked for three solicitors after college. It was a good first job because the people were nice and helped her learn. But there was no chance to move up. She left and traveled for a year. Now she works for a big company as a Personal Assistant. She says her job has grown and she has become more able. Her boss helps her learn and gives her special projects to do.

Some people are very confident, but they didn't always feel that way. They learned to be confident. I talked to five people and asked them how they did it.
A Jenny I was shy when I was young. But I helped at my daughter's school and did well. Someone suggested I take a course. I was nervous at first, but I became more outgoing.
B Michaela I had to take care of my family's business when my father got sick. I was very scared, but I learned to believe in myself. When things are hard, I don't worry if I don't finish everything. I tell myself I have nothing to lose.
C Lisa People think I'm confident, but I'm actually very nervous. I had to learn to look confident because it's important in my job. I interview people and I see that everyone gets nervous. The best advice I got was from my mother: ""Who's looking at you? Everyone is too busy thinking about themselves.""
D Barbara I like my job, so I feel confident. If you make mistakes, you can learn from them and try again. I work hard and people like me. I don't worry if not everyone likes me. You should like yourself, not try to be someone else.
E Kim I used to be too scared to speak up in meetings. But I started speaking up and now I'm more confident. When I first spoke in public, I was very nervous. I would tell myself, ""Don't be silly. Other people do this all the time."" It's okay to be a little scared, but you can do it.
The secret to confidence is to believe in yourself and tell yourself you can do it."

I went to Malaysia to see a kite-flying festival. I met a man named Adnan who gave me a special kite. He said, ""Keep it, it's a tradition. If the string breaks, the finder gets to keep it."" He showed me many more kites at his feet. We sat under a tree and watched the festival. There were many people holding kites and waiting for a whistle to blow. When the whistle blew, the kites went up in the air like rockets. I saw many men and boys flying kites. Adnan said, ""Making kites is hard, but flying them is easy."" He invited me to his house to show me how to make kites. I went to his house and had tea and snacks. He told me to come back the next day to help him fix his kite, but I didn't have time. Instead, I drove to a different part of the state. I took a wrong turn and ended up at a river. I took a boat to the other side and saw a sign that said ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" I walked up the path and met a man who gave me tea. He lived in a tent and had a few huts. I stayed there for the night. It was dark and noisy, but I was okay. In the morning, I saw a beautiful view of the mountains. It rained in the afternoon. I got wet and slid down the hill. I was worried about my car, but it was okay. When I got back to the city, everyone was friendly and asked me questions. They asked where I was from and how old I was. I remember Malaysia for its kind people and the kite festival.

Some kids, between 10 and 15 years old, go to cooking classes on Saturdays. They learn how to cook in small groups. Many kids want to join the class, so there's a waiting list. Parents pay £280 for the course. The kids have fun and learn to make yummy food.
Bill, who is 10, loves his mom's cooking. Now he can cook better than her. The teachers make the kids laugh, especially when they eat the food they made.
Flora is 12 and likes cooking. She made a meal for her friends and they liked it. Her mom thought it would be good for her to find a hobby instead of staying at home all weekend. Flora was not sure at first, but she's happy she joined the class.
Their teacher, Philippe, says it's fun. Kids pay attention and remember things better than grown-ups. The kitchen can get messy when the kids cook! But if parents teach their kids to cook when they're young, they'll be able to make their own food when they grow up."

What is money? Money is like a special ticket that you can use to buy things. It comes in different names, like pounds, dollars, or francs. You can use money to buy things like books, candy, or movie tickets. But the money itself is just a piece of paper.
A long time ago, people didn't have money like we do now. They didn't have banks or stores. Instead, they traded things with each other. For example, a farmer might give some corn to a beekeeper in exchange for honey. This was a special deal between two people.
Later, people created their own special money, so they could trade more easily. Different places started using their own money, and eventually, countries started using their own money too. That's why we use different currencies today."

'Grass is a very good plant. There are many types of grass - over 9,000! You can find them everywhere in the world. Grass grows in very cold places, like the North Pole, and in hot places, like the desert. Grass is important for animals. They eat it, live on it, and use it for shelter. Grass is very strong and can grow back quickly if it gets hurt. It grows new leaves from the ground, not from the top of the plant. This means that many animals can live together in the same place. When they eat all the grass, there is always more to eat because the grass grows again.'"

Finally, a new line was built. The train is not very fast and doesn't stop much. Most people who ride the train are on holiday. The train was originally built to carry goods, not people.

'Ben Nevis is a big mountain in Scotland. Many people climb it every year. It's a difficult climb because it's very cold and snowy. Keith Hewitt climbed Ben Nevis for the first time in winter. He went up the north face of the mountain to a place called Tower Ridge. It's very high - 600 metres up! They planned to stay in a special place on the mountain for three days. They took tents, sleeping bags, and special shoes with spikes for walking on the snow.
Even though some of the group were very experienced, they took many safety things like lights and extra clothes. The weather was good, but they were still a bit nervous. The climb was hard, and Keith had to rest often. The others waited for him, but then they went on again. Keith promised to train more before climbing again.
After 200 metres, they reached the start of Tower Ridge. It's very narrow and the mountain drops down very far on both sides. They had to be careful and take their time. After seven hours, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye far away. But it was misty when Keith climbed, so he couldn't see much.
Going down the mountain can be just as hard as going up. You need to know how to read a map to find the right way. Keith was happy they took turns doing this job. He was relieved to be back in his tent and could say he enjoyed the climb. He was proud of making it to the top!'"

Our new school is very exciting! We moved into a new building last week. It's made of wood, like our old school, but it's special because it's good for the environment. The builders took a long time to build it. We saw it being built and it was fun to watch. But it was noisy and sometimes the builders had to stop work because it rained.
We have five big classrooms now. We share one room with the town people who have meetings. There's a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. We're looking forward to using them soon.
When you come into the school, you'll notice it's warm inside. That's because we make the heat with our bodies, the teachers' bodies, and the computers. The building is special because it keeps the heat and sound inside. If we sing in class, it feels like we're in a big concert hall!
You'll also see a tree on the roof. The builders put it there because it's a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity comes from a big wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went to see it yesterday and it's very big and fast.

In the evening, I watch my favorite movies on my computer. Sometimes I fall asleep before the movie is finished. I like walking around the city and going to shops. It's cold in December, but I like it. I even bought a warm hat. The Russians said it was not cold, but it was warm in my room.
Now, we are preparing for a new show. There's also a competition for young dancers. I'm going to try. I feel very lucky to be here."

'THE ICEHOTEL A long time ago, people went to the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in the winter, the snow and ice were all alone. One day, someone thought, ""Why not use the winter to make something special?"" In 1990, a French artist built an igloo in a small town in Sweden. Many people came to see it. One night, some brave visitors slept in the igloo and loved it. That's how the idea of the ICEHOTEL started.
Now, every year, people from all over the world come to build the hotel. They use snow and ice to make the hotel. It takes a few weeks to finish. When it's done, people can stay there and sleep in the cold. But don't worry, the hotel is warm inside, between -5 and -8 degrees Celsius. You can even borrow warm clothes, like hats and gloves. You can also buy warm clothes and other things you need on the ICEHOTEL website. The hotel is in a small village near the Arctic Circle, close to an airport and a train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the hotel.

A new shop called Homestyle sold furniture. It opened at midnight last Thursday. Many people went to the shop. There were special deals, like a sofa for £45 and a bed for £30. The shop said it would stay open 24 hours, but it had to close after half an hour. The police came because there were too many people. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They didn't want to wait in line. There were also cars trying to park, and some people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.
One customer, Jenny, said she waited three hours and didn't have time to buy what she wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. They had to close the shop because it wasn't safe. Jenny said she will come back when the shop reopens, but she won't wait in line again.

Tanya Streeter is a world champion free-diver. She can breathe underwater for a very long time without using a tank. In 2003, she made history by diving 120 meters deep into the ocean and coming back up without help. She was very careful and had many safety divers watching her.
Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya says safety is very important. She trains hard every day. She goes to the gym, swims in the pool, and exercises on an exercise bike. She doesn't run because it can hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit.
When Tanya is not training, she travels to different places to do practice dives. She does 14 dives in 4 weeks, with a day off in between. She must be careful not to get tired.
Tanya also helps with environmental projects and makes films. She grew up on an island and loved swimming and exploring the ocean. She says her life is like her childhood dreams.
Tanya is famous in some countries, so people listen to her when she talks about protecting the environment. She wants to keep breaking her own records and will continue free-diving for many years.

New ideas and special computer tools make cartoons exciting again for everyone. A long time ago, people thought cartoons were only for kids. But then some clever directors had new ideas. They showed that cartoons could be fun for both kids and grown-ups. Not all cartoon movies were successful. One movie, The Black Cauldron, did not do well.

I didn't expect to get a big TV role in my first year at university. I had only acted at school before. I loved the book ""The Finnegans"" since I was 11. My grandma said I was like the main character, Polly Finnegan. I took a year off to travel before university. When I was in Chile, my mom told me they were making the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try out for the part. She was surprised, but sent my picture to the director and he wanted to meet me. I flew back and got the part. We filmed outside for three weeks, so I got permission from the university to miss that time. When I got back, I woke up at 6:00 am to do my schoolwork. I didn't tell my friends, but they found out and thought it was cool. It was an amazing experience. I feel very lucky. After university, I want to be an actress. My grandpa was an opera singer, but I'm not from an acting family. I've tried for other TV roles, but didn't get any. I don't know how I did it, because I had a busy social life too.

Honey is a sweet liquid that bees make. It's made from water and sugar. Bees fly a long way to make honey. They visit many flowers to make just a little bit of honey. The colour and taste of honey depend on the flowers they visit. There are many types of honey. Light honey is not as sweet as dark honey. A long time ago, honey was a special food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians liked honey very much and used it as money. Today, people make and eat honey all around the world.

Norwich is a city in East Anglia, a part of Britain. It has been a place where people live for over 2,000 years. A long time ago, it was a small village near a river. When the Normans came to England in 1066, Norwich had grown into a big town. There are two big churches and a mosque in Norwich. The oldest church was built in 1095 and is very old.
Norwich is a special city because it has a special document from the king. This document says the city can make its own decisions and be called a city. Many years ago, Norwich was a very important city in England. It was the second biggest city and had many churches and pubs. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but Norwich is still a nice place to live.
There is a big university in Norwich, and many students come to study here. The city is also a good place for business and has many shops, restaurants, and places to go out at night. There is also a football team, and their colours are green and yellow. The team is called ""The Canaries"", but nobody knows why.
In the city, there is a new shopping centre called ""The Castle Mall"". It's a big place with a park on the roof and a big hole in the middle.

They would bring food, clothes, and mail to the people who lived in the town.
The path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took a long time for the dogs to get from one end to the other. They stopped at special places called roadhouses to rest and eat. People used this path every winter until airplanes came. But in 1925, something special happened. A bad sickness called diphtheria came to the town of Nome. The medicine to make people better was far away, and the only way to get it was by dog sled. Twenty teams of dogs worked together to bring the medicine to Nome. They followed the Iditarod Trail and did it in just six days. A dog named Balto was very brave and helped save the team.

Winter Driving
Winter driving is tricky because it's hard to know what will happen and accidents can happen easily. Fog can suddenly appear on a hill, and ice can be hidden under the snow. Cars can slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, follow these rules:
Rule Number One: Drive slowly and smoothly. Don't make sudden movements. Imagine you're carrying a cup of hot coffee - drive carefully so you don't spill it.
Rule Number Two: Watch out for what might happen. Look far ahead, especially on icy roads. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be going faster than you think. When the road is wet, snowy, or icy, leave more space between you and the car in front of you.
Stay in control of your car and you'll be safe.

Now, Ben's friends come to our house with their guitars and other things. The house gets noisy. My husband and I like to go for a walk when they play. The music is strange, but the boys are nice. They play in local clubs for young people. We worry that they might not do their schoolwork because of their music, but so far, that's not happened. I always remind Ben how important his schoolwork is. But one thing is true: having drums has kept Ben out of trouble and he's never bored."""

'Atlantic College I visited Atlantic College in Wales. It's a special school that helps students learn and do new things outside of class. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from many countries. They study in the morning and then do something useful in the afternoon, like helping on a farm or taking care of people who need help.
Many students come from different countries and families. Some students can't afford to pay the fees, so the college gives them help. Some British students also get help from the government.
I talked to a student from the Netherlands, Barbara. She said, ""I like Atlantic College because it teaches us to respect people from different countries. I didn't argue with my sister as much during the summer holidays.""
In short, Atlantic College is a great school that teaches students well and helps them learn new things.'

I was a secretary, but I was bored because I didn't have to think much. I was unhappy and jealous of the students at the local university who looked happy and free. I wanted to learn more. Now that I'm a student, it's hard for me to talk to my classmates because they think I'm a teacher and ask me questions I don't know. I also feel different from the teachers because I don't know as much as they do. But I'm glad I'm studying because I know I need a degree to get a good job. I like studying more than going out on weekends. I also like having long holidays and discounts for movies and theater. Sometimes I worry about what I'll do after university, but I think it was a good choice.'"

Henry Ford was born in Michigan in 1863. He didn't like farming. When he was 15, he started working as a mechanic. He built his first car in 1893. He drove it a lot and then sold it. He built two more cars and in 1903, he started a company called Ford Motor Company. He made cars that were strong and light, so they were cheap for people to buy. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model T. It cost $825. People liked it and he sold 100 cars every day! By 1927, his company was worth a lot of money. Henry Ford's cars were simple and cheap, but that meant people didn't have many choices. He said, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

Corryvale Farm is in England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler take care of cows, chickens, and sheep. They sell milk and eggs, but most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each one gives enough wool for six sweaters. Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep every six months so they don't get too hot.
Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at a market. But it was summer, and people didn't want sweaters. So she made some socks instead. Everyone liked them because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started.
At first, Jenny made the socks at home. But soon she had many customers, so she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, the socks are made on machines. There are six colors, five sizes, and different socks for walkers, sports people, and skiers. Jenny is very busy at Christmas because people like to buy Corryvale socks as presents.

He said 67% of burglaries happen when people forget to lock a door or window. He said it's hard for burglars to break in at night because families are usually home then. But he said winter afternoons are a good time for burglars because it's dark and they can't be seen. Many houses are empty at that time because people are still at work. Inspector Saunders said it's a good idea to leave lights on when you're not home. This will help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch each other's houses when people are not home. If they see something strange, they should call the police. Inspector Saunders said we will also get help to make our houses safe. And it's free!""

I'm sorry I have to leave the English class. You are a good teacher. Please say goodbye to the other students for me.
Thank you,
Soraya"

THE OSTRICH
The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. It can be very heavy, over 90 kilos. Most ostriches live in Africa, but there are not many left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings. But they can't fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches are very fast. They can run 65 to 90 kilometers per hour. It's hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens. They take 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can go without water for a long time.

'Snowboarding is Victoria Jamieson's favorite sport. She started when she was 20 and is now 23. She has won many competitions. We talked to her at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland. We asked her why she started snowboarding. 'I like sports, especially skiing. Snowboarding is easy to learn and you can get good at it quickly.' We asked if she practices a lot. 'In winter, I snowboard every day from 8.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love doing all these things! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's very beautiful. When I'm not in a competition, I like to do what I want, which is the best part.' We asked what is important when you're learning. 'You can learn quickly if you take lessons. You also need the right clothes so you don't get wet. When you start, you will fall down a lot!''"

Dear Hotel,
I want to stay at your hotel for three nights from September 15th to 17th. I need a single room with a shower. Can I have a phone in my room? I would like a quiet room on the ground floor. I will drive to the hotel. Is there a parking place for my car? I will arrive at 10:30 pm. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? Can I have dinner when I arrive? Thank you.
Sincerely,

'Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it. Some are very young, some are very old. There are different ways to get to the top. One way is the Marangu path. It's five kilometers long and takes five days. Many tourists like this path. Not everyone can climb to the top. Sometimes the weather changes quickly. It can be hot and wet at the bottom, but cold and snowy at the top. Climbers need to bring sunglasses and warm clothes.'"

'Otters Otters are special animals that live near rivers. They build their homes using small pieces of wood. Otters like to come out at night. They are very good swimmers and can swim fast. Otters have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. They can even close their ears and nose when they swim. This means they can stay underwater for a little while. A long time ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were dirty and many fish and insects died. Otters didn't have enough food. But now, the rivers are clean again and there is plenty of food for the otters.'

Dear John,
Thank you for teaching me English. You are a good teacher. I liked staying in Cambridge. Now I'm staying with my brother in his flat. He is a student doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go back to Greece.
I like London very much. Yesterday, we took a bus to Regent's Park. It was sunny and we had fun. Tonight, I'm going to watch a movie with my brother and his friends. I'll write to you again from Greece.
Best wishes,

Dear Carlos,
I'm going to visit your country next month. I'm coming with two friends. We don't know where to stay. Are there any cheap hotels in your town? We want to stay in the middle of the town. Can you help us?
Carlos,
Hotels in the middle of the town are expensive. But I have good news! My aunt Gloria said we can stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house! Is that okay with you?

'People build houses and other buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We also build special places like stadiums for watching football and concerts. Some buildings, like museums, are for keeping nice things in. Many people work together to build a building. The person who designs the building makes drawings to show what it will look like. The engineers make sure it is strong and safe. Then, the workers build it carefully. The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a nice roof. It's beautiful from all sides, not just the top. There's another famous building in Munich that looks like a big glass tent.'"

'There are two towns in England, Sherborne and Dorchester. They are close to each other. Between the towns, there are many green hills and fields. One of these hills has a big picture of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the village near him is called Cerne. Nobody knows exactly when the Cerne Giant was made, but it is very old. You can walk to see the picture from Cerne. On May 1st, when the sun rises, people from the village dance around the man on the hill.'"

'Ivan Petrov Ivan grew up on a farm in Russia. He went to school in Poland from the age of 12 to 18. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano, but taught him and his sister some songs. His mom taught him piano when he was 6. Ivan liked music so much that he started writing his own songs when he was 10.
Oleg Gagarin was born in Russia. His dad, who liked playing piano, taught him some Russian music when he was 4. When Oleg was 6, he started taking piano lessons from a teacher in his city. He won prizes for his piano playing soon. When he was 14, he went to music school in Austria for 2 years. Then he went back to Russia.
Josef Heptmann was born in Poland. His dad, who was German, taught music in Poland. When Josef was 2, his family moved to Germany. He started playing piano when he was 3. He gave his first concert when he was 6. Josef loved music, but he also liked physics and languages. He is very busy now, but maybe one day he will write his own music.'
I minimized changes to the factual content of the passage while simplifying the language to make it easier for an A1 learner to understand. I used shorter sentences and more basic vocabulary to make the text more accessible."

'POSTCARDS People like to send postcards to their friends and family. They have pictures of nice places like the beach, mountains, or a castle. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they go on holiday. Postcards are cheap and the pictures are nice. Someone sent the first postcard a long time ago. It was a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed what was happening in the news. People liked them because they didn't have pictures in their newspapers then.'

There were over 5,000 kinds. Some were small, but some were very big. The biggest were the biggest animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus was 20 meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long legs.'

Many years later, in the United States, two other brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew in it. Then, the post office started sending letters by air. Planes changed a lot after that. In the 1950s, planes got faster because they had special engines. A special plane called Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest plane in the world and can fly very fast. Now, many people travel by plane, and it's hard to imagine a world without them.'"

All the actors were men. People would eat, talk, and walk around during the show. Sometimes, they even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. There is a new building there near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play or learn about life a long time ago.""

I'm having a nice holiday in Australia. When we got here, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now it's better and we go to the beach every day. We are staying in Sydney this week and next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is warm, so I like swimming there. The fish are different colors here: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very nice. We don't want to go home! See you at the end of September. Bye, Sue.'
