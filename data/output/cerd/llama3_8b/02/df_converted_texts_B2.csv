Paying for trash bags: a waste of money? 

In many countries, people throw away their trash without paying for it. But is this a good idea? Some economists think not. They believe that if people have to pay for their trash, they will produce less of it and recycle more. This makes sense, but it's not that simple.

In some American towns, people have started paying for their trash bags. This means that households are charged for each bag of trash they throw away. The idea is that this will encourage people to reduce the amount of trash they produce and recycle more. But a study by two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this approach didn't work as well as expected.

In one town, Charlottesville, Virginia, people were charged 80 cents for each trash bag. This led to a 37% reduction in the number of bags used. However, people simply filled the bags more, which didn't make a big difference in the end. The weight of the trash collected only decreased by 14%. In other towns where people didn't have to pay for their trash, the weight of the trash collected also decreased, but not as much.

The study also found that some people started dumping their trash illegally instead of paying for it. This made it hard to measure the effect of the trash bag policy. The only positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, but this might have happened anyway.

The economists concluded that charging for trash bags doesn't make a big difference in the amount of trash produced. It would take a much bigger change, such as buying fewer products, to make a significant impact. They suggest that other factors, like income and education, might play a bigger role in reducing waste.

While charging for trash bags might not be the best solution, it's still important to find ways to reduce waste. The study shows that simple policies can have complex effects, and we need to consider all the factors before making a decision.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a B2 level learner:

Many people are not satisfied with their jobs. They feel undervalued and unappreciated. Success is no longer enough; we need to ask ourselves what our job does to our personal growth, relationships, and well-being. Our skills are not just about making a living, but about being a fulfilled human being. We need to rethink how we approach work, making it a way to discover our talents, connect with others, and find meaning.

The problem is not just about unemployment, but about the kind of jobs we have. Many people are unhappy in their careers, even if they are successful. Doctors, accountants, and architects often feel stressed and unfulfilled. We need to find ways to make work more enjoyable and meaningful.

I am exploring different occupations to see how they affect people's lives. I am looking at how different cultures have viewed human potential and how we can create a sense of purpose and fulfillment in our work. I believe that work should be a way to become a better person, not just a way to earn a living.

For example, in the hospitality industry, many people are underutilized and unhappy. Hotels could be more than just a place to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could be encouraged to use their skills and talents, rather than just doing menial tasks.

Work is a relationship, and we need to rethink what this means. We need to give people the freedom to design their own jobs, choose their own colleagues, and communicate effectively with others. We need to move beyond traditional categories and find new ways to make work more meaningful and fulfilling.

I hope this version captures the main ideas and themes of the original text while making it more accessible to a B2 level learner.<|eot_id|>"

""BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand. It's a metaphor that implies planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The idea is that there is a central source of resources that can be used to spread and reproduce information. But why did a new technology that transmits words and pictures electronically become organized in a way that fits this agricultural metaphor?

Television, as a technology, is related to other forms of two-way communication, like the telephone and telegraph. It's surprising that it was seen as a centralized'mass' medium from the start. This was because it fit with the social and economic structures of modern societies. Attempts to organize it differently were just that - attempts.

In the 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television, but big business and the government eventually shut them down. In the US, television was primarily seen as a medium for theatrical exhibitions, and was often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In other countries, public viewing of television was common.

Despite the idea of grass-roots or amateur television, the dominant structure of broadcasting was centralized and focused on reaching a dispersed audience through public settings. This fit with the modern idea of the home as a place for entertainment and cultural experiences.

As people's standards of living improved and they entered consumer society, the idea of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for most people. This is happening on a global scale today.

There is a clear relationship between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernization led to centralization and concentration of power, the break-up of traditional communities created new ways of life. Centralized broadcasting was seen as a way to reach all citizens with important information efficiently and to produce a sense of national unity.

However, what is often left out of this story is the idea of broadcasting as a way to secure equal access to resources for democratic participation in political, social, and cultural life. As television changes, the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated, and we may see it as a particular organization of audio-visual technology during a specific phase of social modernization.""

""Feeling Secure with Possessions

It's natural to want to own things that make us feel safe and comfortable. However, sometimes we can get carried away with buying and accumulating possessions, and this can lead to feelings of insecurity. Advertisers often use clever tactics to make us feel like we need things we don't really need. They make us feel like we're not good enough if we don't have certain products.

But have you ever noticed how many advertisements there are around us? They're everywhere - on billboards, TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and even on the internet. They're designed to persuade us to buy, buy, buy. And it's not just advertisements. Even scientific research can be influenced by our desire to acquire things.

Caves and Research

Caves are fascinating natural formations that have been studied by scientists for a long time. Researchers have spent years studying caves to learn about their origins, how they're formed, and what lives in them. Caves are also a source of curiosity for many people, and this has led to a lot of research and exploration.

Weather and Observation

Meteorology is the study of the weather, and it's a complex science that has been developed over the centuries. We used to rely on our own observations to predict the weather, but now we have advanced technology like satellites and computers to help us. However, human observation is still an important part of weather forecasting. Our own experiences and observations can provide valuable information that helps meteorologists make accurate predictions.""

'Music and Theatre: A New Perspective

Until recently, I thought opera was primarily a form of theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first. This is as it should be. I come from a world where the spoken word is primary, where there is no director controlling the action once the performance begins, and where performers and audience members mostly speak the same language. In contrast, music performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, often have a significant number of people who don't understand music. Some may feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge, while others are in awe of the performers' skills. A great musician's hard work is evident, and it's easy to admire their talent. Watching a top-class music performance is like watching an athletic event - we recognize the effort and skill involved, even if we couldn't achieve it ourselves.

Theatre audiences, on the other hand, have different expectations. They don't fully understand the skill involved in acting and are not often impressed by something that seems similar to what they could do themselves. They might ask an actor how they memorize their lines. This doesn't mean theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; in fact, many are the same people. Perhaps what it means is that audiences and performers connect on more equal terms in theatre than in music.

I think music could learn from theatre about this relationship. I've seen how a different approach can enhance the concert-goer's experience. Music is inherently theatrical, with passion, humor, and intimacy. However, the conventions that dominate music presentations, such as strict dress codes and deference to conductors and soloists, emphasize the difference between performers and listeners, creating a hierarchical atmosphere. On the other hand, interrupting the performance with applause can be insensitive to the overall work.

Is there a solution? Of course, there is. Efforts are underway to encourage new audiences and break down barriers. I recall a remarkable event, Jonathan Dove's community opera In Search of Angels, which combined professional musicians with community participation. It was a life-changing experience for many audience members. What I yearn for in music is a bit more of the risk and radicalism that theatre can display. Sometimes, this comes from using unconventional locations, disrupting normal expectations. This can have a profound impact on both performers and audience.

I believe that music can and should change its conventions. As an enthusiast, I love and support both theatre and music. I want them to thrive and for more people to experience the joy I get from being an audience member.'<|eot_id|>"

I don't like sand when it's not used to make things like glass or concrete. It's just a nuisance when it's on the beach. It gets everywhere, makes a mess, and sticks to you when you're wet. But when you sit on a towel or walk on a clean floor, it suddenly disappears. It's as if it's stuck to you forever! I'm not a fan of sand.

The search for a safe and secure home has been going on for a long time. People want to feel safe and protected from harm. Locks and keys are a way to achieve this. Even with modern technology, people still prefer the feeling of turning a physical key in a lock. A locksmith company recently developed an electronic lock that still has a physical key. It's a mix of old and new.

I was worried about visiting the Tate Modern art gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some pieces, like sculptures and big photographs. But I don't know much about art. The idea is that art should communicate with you, not just be something you try to understand. The Tate Modern has labels that explain what each piece is about, which helped me understand it better. I used to just stare at the pictures, but now I can see what they're trying to say.

Adapting novels for film is a process of cutting down and focusing on the most important parts. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be helpful. When working on a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and description from the novel while still keeping the main idea. This doesn't mean that the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's just that the way we pay attention to stories is different in books and movies.

In books, we need more information to understand the characters and what's happening. In movies, we can get the same information from the visuals and the acting. So, we don't need as much repetition or extra details.

Watching movies can be a magical experience. It's like being transported to a different world. We can forget about our everyday problems and just enjoy the story. But when the movie is over, we snap back to reality and don't feel like we've been changed by the experience.

In the past, people didn't think movies were a serious art form. They saw them as just entertainment. But now, many people want to make their own movies. There are many books and courses to help them do it. Some people even make successful movies with very little money.

The film studio I visited was a confusing place. There were many small rooms, and it was hard to find your way around. But the people who worked there knew where they were going. They were making movies, and they were good at their jobs.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B2 level learner:

In those days, the council houses in the western part of the city were lined up in rows. They were made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from the nearby factory would hang in the air, making the smell of sulphur noticeable. Many mornings, you could see a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he delivered papers to the houses.

I don't remember much from my early childhood. However, I do remember sitting on a windowsill, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, I remember other faces, like my mother, ironing clothes in a room that wasn't ours. I remember the snow falling on the turrets of a big house in Earlham.

My mother was a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, and I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, I noticed that she was a very solitary person, even in a crowded room. She had a strong sense of propriety, which sometimes led to furious cleaning sessions or strict rules about behavior.

As I grew up, I realized that my mother's behavior was influenced by her upbringing and her friends. She had a few close friends, like Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who never said much, and Mrs. Laband, who was a bit more lively but also a bit disapproved of by the others. These women would often talk about their problems, such as bad health, the weather, and ungrateful children. I often felt like I was included in this category.

Looking back, it seemed like a heavy burden was weighing me down - the houses, my mother, her friends, and the need to behave properly. I felt like I had to grow up and break free from this weight. However, it wasn't easy.

In West Earlham, growing up followed a predictable pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and got under your parents' feet. Then, at age five, you went to school. If you were lucky, your mother would take you on a rickety bike with a child seat. Otherwise, you would walk with other children from the street. I remember the summer holidays, when we would catch glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. We would visit neighbors, attend charity events, or go to the museum.

My mother was strict and didn't like politicians. She thought they were only interested in money. She would take me to the museum on Sundays, where we would walk hand-in-hand, looking at paintings. My mother wasn't opposed to this, and eventually, she even developed opinions about the art. I remember her once saying, ""I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"" about a painting of a Roman soldier. This was a rare moment of humor from my mother.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The street was getting darker, and the air was thick with humidity. I knew this side of the street from when I was a child. There were houses where my friends lived, and a grocery store where my family shopped. As I walked, I noticed that the houses got smaller and the porches lower. Over the years, some of the houses had changed. Wooden porch rails had been replaced with iron ones, and some stores had become homes again.

I visited a friend, Rick Gilbert, who lives in a former curtain warehouse. He wanted to make his space feel more like a home, so he divided it up with a big piece of plastic. He also added a kitchen and some sentimental furniture. He likes to cook for his friends and work from home.

Bruce Chatwin was a famous writer who loved to travel. His book, ""In Patagonia,"" is a classic. He mixed fact and fiction to create a thrilling story. Chatwin believed that traveling could help us discover new things and learn about the past.

One summer, I was swimming in my backyard pool during a heavy rainstorm. The raindrops created a lot of bubbles, and I felt like I was swimming in a magical world. I realized that swimming could be a way to escape and explore new places. Most of us are used to following signs and maps, but swimming allows us to break free and discover new things.

I decided to take a long swim through Britain, following the rain and the sea. I wanted to break free from the routine of swimming laps and explore the unknown. I believed that this journey would help me regain a sense of wonder and adventure.<|eot_id|>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no particular reason. But scientists now think that crying is important for social reasons. For example, a psychiatrist named John Bowlby found that crying helps children form a strong bond with their mothers. Many people believe that children cry when they're helpless, but it's harder to understand why adults still cry. It seems that the sound of crying is less important than the way it makes us look. In the past, crying might have helped early human communities feel more connected and trusting. We might also cry to show sympathy for others who are suffering. Sometimes we cry involuntarily, like when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. We might cry when watching a sad movie, but it's more likely to happen when we're with others. The importance of crying for social reasons seems clear, but scientists are still studying it.

The Earth is getting warmer due to global warming. We know it's happening, but we're not sure exactly how much warmer it will get and how it will affect our lives. Climate change will bring changes to the weather all over the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to every part of the planet, any changes to the climate will have significant effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.

We've learned to use natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support our population. Any changes to these resources are important to consider. The problem is that we're not sure exactly how the world will change and what's causing these changes. We do know that human activities have increased the concentration of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are building up and may already be affecting the climate.

Scientists use computer models to predict the future. These models are based on laws of physics and chemistry and can analyze the interaction of temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, these models are simplified and have limitations. They can only provide approximate results and are slow and expensive to run.

Despite these challenges, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we've experienced before. The predictions suggest that the average global temperature will rise by 1-3.5°C by 2100, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts will become more frequent.

Climate change will affect the natural environment and human societies. It will impact the geographical locations of ecosystems, the mix of species, and the resources we rely on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some areas will experience negative effects, while others may benefit. For example, warmer temperatures have increased wheat production in Australia.

However, many predicted effects of climate change will be negative. Small changes in climate can affect the availability of water, leading to droughts and water shortages. This will be a problem in arid and semi-arid regions and areas with existing water shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is already experiencing decreasing precipitation totals and changing seasonality.

Climate change will also affect glaciers, which will impact vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. The Arctic's ice cover may melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.

The most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the melting of ice. Half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, which will be severely affected by rising sea levels. This will lead to flooding, inundation, and displacement of people, potentially creating millions of environmental refugees. Small, low-lying island states will be particularly affected, with entire countries potentially ceasing to exist if worst-case scenarios occur.<|eot_id|>"

Art and the way we think about it can be confusing. We often focus on the physical objects themselves, like paintings or sculptures, instead of what they do to and in our experience. This can make it hard to understand what art is and what it means.

When we consider a work of art as a separate entity, it can become isolated from the context in which it was created and the way it affects our lives. This can make it difficult to see the bigger picture and understand its significance.

To understand art, we need to connect it to our everyday experiences and the world around us. This means looking at the ordinary things we do and the scenes we encounter, and seeing how they can be beautiful and meaningful.

Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comic strips, but they might not consider them ""art"" because they are not in a museum or gallery. However, these things can be just as enjoyable and meaningful as more traditional forms of art.

The problem is that many people separate art from everyday life, and this can make it hard to appreciate the beauty and significance of art. When we connect art to the things we do and experience every day, we can gain a deeper understanding of its value and importance.

For example, when we appreciate the beauty of nature, we are not just looking at a pretty view, we are experiencing the world around us. Similarly, when we appreciate a work of art, we are not just looking at a painting or sculpture, we are experiencing the emotions and ideas it evokes.

To understand art, we need to look at it in the context of our everyday lives, and see how it can enrich and enhance our experiences. This is the task of the philosopher who studies art: to connect the beauty and significance of art to the world around us.<|eot_id|>"

Observing Lions

When we think of lions hunting, we imagine a group of cats working together like a well-rehearsed team. They seem like perfect examples of social animals, putting aside their differences to achieve a common goal. But after spending many years studying lions in the wild, we have a different view. We wanted to understand why they hunt together, care for their young, and chase away rivals. If we measure an animal's success by how many babies it has, then working together doesn't always pay off. So, why don't lions just look out for themselves? We thought we would quickly find the answer, but lions are experts at doing nothing. It's taken us a long time to figure out their behavior, and now we're only just starting to understand.

Pop Music Review

Bedrock's third album, New Life, was a game-changer in the music world. It marked a shift away from the serious and angsty sound of the past and towards a lighter, more melodic style.

The album's greatest strength is its consistency - 16 tracks with no filler is a rare achievement.

Extract from an Autobiography

As a child, I was fascinated by the stories of the Sibyl, wise women who had great influence in ancient times. My mother told me about an old woman who offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold coins, but he refused. She then offered him six books for the same price, and he refused again. Finally, she sold him the remaining three books for the full 300 gold coins. I realized even then that there was a valuable lesson hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was often a lonely child, but my mother taught me to do something interesting so that other kids would want to join me. I've never forgotten that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something that interested me and was relevant to my life. I'm not a big fan of traveling, but I love exploring the past through ruins.

The 1990s were a challenging time for advertising agencies. The global recession had a severe impact on businesses, leading to job losses, home repossessions, and a decline in consumer spending. Advertisers, in particular, felt under pressure to deliver results with smaller budgets. They were expected to create effective campaigns with limited resources, making it a difficult time for those in the industry.

Despite the challenges, the importance of marketing and advertising was becoming more recognized. Companies were starting to understand the need to produce products and services that customers wanted, rather than just what was convenient for them. This shift led to a greater emphasis on marketing and a rise in the status of marketing professionals.

However, this increased importance also brought new pressures. Advertisers were expected to produce high-quality work with minimal budgets, and clients were demanding better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement. The industry was facing a crisis, with many companies questioning the effectiveness of advertising.

The recession had also led to a re-examination of the costs and benefits of advertising. Clients wanted to see a clear return on their investment, and advertisers were struggling to deliver. The industry was under scrutiny, with many companies seeking better results from their advertising agencies.

The challenges facing advertisers were not limited to the recession. Demographic changes, the rise of retailers, changing consumer needs, and legal restrictions on advertising all added to the difficulties. For some companies, the challenge of advertising abroad also presented a new hurdle.

In this environment, it was difficult for advertisers to find help and guidance. Companies were too busy coping with the challenges to share their experiences, and those who had succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. As a result, the books and resources available on advertising were limited, and those that did exist often presented an unrealistic view of the industry.

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice for my friends, as cooking was not considered a prestigious profession. Chefs often work long hours, under pressure, and are not well paid. However, these challenges didn't deter me. I was unhappy at university, where the work was hard and the social scene was superficial. Cooking seemed like a refreshing change, with its focus on seriousness and integrity. But my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to my university experience. I had always been fascinated by the art of cooking and wanted to learn more.

My first experience of good cooking was at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing, and I was inspired to learn more about cooking. I started reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and preparing elaborate meals. I even stopped attending classes at university, as I was more interested in learning about cooking.

The next part of the passage talks about a person who is learning to dive. The instructor is strict and demanding, but the student is determined to improve. The student eventually learns to dive from the high board and feels a sense of freedom and euphoria.

The final part of the passage discusses the phenomenon of travelers who choose to take risks and live in challenging environments. Some people might find this hard to understand, but it's a choice that these individuals have made.

Fashion is often seen as a modern concept, but it has a long history that goes back centuries. Historians of fashion argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has been around for a long time. They often point to the rise of trade and commerce in the 16th and 17th centuries as the starting point. As societies become more complex, populations grow, and new technologies for making clothes and accessories are developed, the meanings attached to clothing also become more complex. This means it's hard to say exactly what an item of clothing or accessory means today. For example, a man's suit, which seems like a uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and for different people.

As for writers, the media often portrays them as struggling to make a living, but the reality is different. Some writers have other full-time jobs to fall back on, while others, like me, have to juggle part-time jobs, teaching, and freelance writing to make ends meet. I've heard of some writers getting lucky breaks, like working for a chocolate company, but I haven't been that fortunate. Despite the challenges, writers like me manage to finish their novels with the help of friends, family, and credit cards.

Sudden Fame

We were playing at small venues around the country and selling out shows. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being mobbed by fans. When we weren't working, we had trouble leaving the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our movements were monitored, and our needs were taken care of by our management and others. Although my shyness never fully went away, it was replaced by a strange confidence that comes from being thrust into the spotlight. In short, I was overwhelmed emotionally.

'Music in the Future

Technology is changing the way we live and work, and it's also changing the way we enjoy music. In the past, we had more ways to listen to music, such as radio, TV, records, and CDs. This has led to a decline in the number of people attending live music performances and the number of full-time jobs for professional musicians.

Despite this, music is still an important part of our lives. It's a big part of many national events and provides opportunities for people to express themselves and connect with others. In the future, we can expect to see more diverse types of music and more use of technology to create and perform music.

Playing a musical instrument can also have many benefits, such as improving spatial reasoning and social skills. Research has shown that playing an instrument can even help people develop good study habits and concentration.

In the short term, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching. However, in the long term, the music profession may need to adapt to changes in the way people listen to and participate in music. This could include a greater focus on community-based music-making and a wider range of musical skills being taught.

To prepare for these changes, musicians will need to be trained to teach people of all ages and backgrounds, and to work with large and diverse groups. They will also need to develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills.

Ultimately, it's important for those involved in the music profession to work together to raise the profile of music and ensure that it remains an important part of our lives.'

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Actors often face criticism and disdain. Sometimes, they themselves contribute to this by talking about their work in interviews. They should remember the words of Pavlova, a famous dancer, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, they often use clichés or talk about themselves in a way that is boring and empty. 

Paul Scofield, a well-known actor, said that an actor's work only comes alive when they perform it. When they discuss it, it becomes empty and theoretical. Every play is a new challenge, and actors must start from scratch each time. 

Adrian Lester's performance in Hamlet is impressive. He plays a young man who is both angry and funny. He uses his body and voice to bring the character to life. 

So, what is acting? Is it just imitating behavior or is it something more? Who or what brings characters to life? These are the questions that are at the heart of the theatre.

One director's approach to rehearsal is called ""dropping in."" The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, and then they find their own way to respond. They don't plan what they will say, but instead let their thoughts and feelings guide them.

The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. The staff should feel like they are part of the performance, not just doing a job. The auditorium should be designed to make the audience feel connected to the performers. It's important to have a sense of history and tradition in the theatre. The plays should be chosen carefully, and the audience should be surprised and engaged.

Rock and roll music in the 1950s was mainly popular among young people, but it had a big impact on middle-class adults too. It paved the way for new rock stars and influenced the music of future generations. For Paul Simon, listening to Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, was a crucial part of his musical journey. The show was a must-listen for many young rock fans, including John Lennon in Liverpool. Paul Simon was fascinated by the music and wanted to make his own. He didn't know what the future held, but he was determined to take small steps and be cautious.

As I walked through the snowy woods, I slipped and fell into a hidden hole. The snow had melted, leaving a thin layer on top, and I fell four feet down.

I realized that I wouldn't be able to continue my plan, as I had only covered half a mile in an hour.

Qualitative Research

There are many books about qualitative research, but they often don't explain the process of analyzing data. It's not clear how researchers do it. We invited social scientists to share their approaches to data analysis, not to create a guide for new researchers. We wanted to demystify the process, making it more explicit. This wasn't easy, so we allowed our contributors to present their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal styles.

Recently, I noticed my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a little dinosaur. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he didn't know much. There is a lot of talk about using computers and the internet for learning, but is it a good way to learn? One writer tried an interactive program with his son and didn't think it was very effective.

Television, like my son's noodle-eating, is an impressionistic medium. Research shows that learning happens best when there is dialogue between teachers or parents. New technology can be useful for teaching, but there is still a big role for traditional education.

Hollywood is a famous place in the United States that has grown from a small village to a big city. It is known for making movies that people love. People who work in Hollywood often talk about their movies and the money they make.

Photography was invented by artists who wanted to capture their surroundings. They found a way to create lasting images using a combination of light, lenses, and chemicals. Some artists were not happy about photography, but photographers knew they had created a new art form.

Book illustration is another art form that has changed over time. In the past, many children's books had illustrations, but some books for older readers did not. The illustrations from this time period are a mix of good and bad, but some are very valuable. There are signs that these illustrations are becoming more popular again, and we may see them in new books or exhibitions.

Blogging: Sharing Your Life with the World

Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of sharing your location online. The point was that when you post where you are, you're also telling everyone about it, not just your friends. This made people realize that there might be downsides to sharing so much on the internet.

The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with a global audience. We can post photos, stories, and even our personal thoughts. However, we often realize too late that the internet is a crowded and complex place, and we can get lost.

Fortunately, there are people who have been through this before. They are the pioneers of blogging, who started sharing their lives online years ago. They faced challenges, made mistakes, and learned from them. We can learn from their experiences.

In 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the internet. He built a website with photos, stories, and art, and people loved it. However, he also faced problems. One day, he fell in love and wrote about it on his blog, but his partner asked him to take it down. Justin's blog disappeared, and he realized that sharing too much online can make people not trust you.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, also faced problems. She wrote about her job and her colleagues, but an anonymous colleague sent her blog to her bosses. She lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where we feel like we can say anything online, but our digital life is connected to our real life. We need to be careful what we share online.

Heather Armstrong learned from her experience and now writes about her family and life as a mommy blogger. She has become a successful blogger and has learned to share her life in a responsible way. We can learn from her experience: just because we can say anything online doesn't mean we should.

Tiredness is a common problem in many countries. As people get busier and richer, they often don't get enough sleep. In the USA, 40 million people have chronic sleep problems. This is why sleep has become a popular topic in books and research. Some researchers think that people need more sleep, especially when they are busy. They suggest that people should sleep for 8-9 hours a night.

One researcher conducted an experiment to test this idea. He asked people to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. The results showed that it took them three weeks to adjust to sleeping 8 hours a night. This indicates that people can recover from sleep deprivation.

In the UK, there is a university sleep research laboratory that studies sleep and fatigue. They investigate how sleep affects people's daily lives, such as sailors and drivers. They also study how noise and traffic can affect sleep. The researchers use volunteers who are paid to take part in the studies.

The laboratory has a special simulator that looks like a car dashboard. The participants are asked to drive while answering questions. The researchers use this to study how sleep affects driving. They found that two cups of coffee can help people stay awake and safe for half an hour.

There are many theories about what sleep does for our bodies. Some scientists think that sleep helps to repair our bodies, while others believe that it helps to rest our brains. However, there is no clear answer.

Interestingly, women tend to sleep for half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep. Some scientists believe that sleep is important for our bodies to recover from the day's activities.

In the past, people had different sleep patterns. In the UK, people used to have two sleeps a night, with a break in between. This was a time for reflection and relaxation. However, with the introduction of artificial light and the industrial revolution, people started sleeping for longer periods at night.

In some non-Western cultures, people still don't have a fixed bedtime. They may sleep for a few hours and then wake up again. This is because they need to be aware of their surroundings and watch out for predators.

Overall, it seems that people all over the world need more sleep.<|eot_id|>"

Vancouver is a city in western Canada that has become very popular over the past ten years. Many people from all over the world have moved there because of its mild climate, beautiful surroundings, and good education and job opportunities. The city is also very clean and safe.

People from different countries and cultures live in Vancouver, and you can hear many different languages being spoken on the streets. The city has changed a lot in recent years, with many new buildings being built. Despite some people complaining about the rapid growth, the influx of new residents and tourists has helped to revitalize the city.

Vancouver was once known as ""Terminal City"" because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much anymore, the city remains an important hub for travel.

As a journalist, I know that many of my colleagues are not good at writing letters. This is not because they are trying to make money, but because they are always trying to make their writing as effective as possible.

On the other hand, artists who are not trying to achieve a specific effect in their work do not have this problem. They are able to be more spontaneous and natural in their writing.

When the film Citizen Kane was finally released in 1941, it received great reviews, but it wasn't a commercial success. It wasn't until it was shown on television that people started talking about it again. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers. It's surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that his lack of experience in filmmaking actually helped him make the film, as he didn't know what he was or wasn't allowed to do. He had a great team working with him, including a cameraman, a screenwriter, and a special effects expert.

The idea for the film came from a conversation between Welles and the screenwriter, Herman J. Mankiewicz. They decided to make a film about a newspaper magnate who was similar to William Randolph Hearst. Welles thought this was a great opportunity for him to play the lead role and direct the film.

The film is about a man who is very powerful and successful, but also lonely and unhappy. He is a newspaper magnate who has everything, but he still feels empty inside. The film shows how he becomes obsessed with a woman and tries to win her over, but ultimately fails.

The title of the film is ""Citizen Kane"" and it is considered one of the greatest films of all time. It has been inspiring filmmakers for many years and continues to be studied and admired today.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a B2 level learner:

I was in Vienna to take photographs. I had been doing this for a long time, and it was my passion. I loved the way light fell on a surface and how a single picture could capture a moment, a place, or a person. One day, I might take the perfect photograph. I always had the chance, as long as I had film in my camera. I would finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with my eyes wide open. That was my way.

I had been lucky once, when a photo of a burning oil well became famous worldwide. After that, I became a freelance photographer. But my life took some unexpected turns. The 1990s were not as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not in a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which was good enough for me.

The assignment was a surprise. I had already taken photos of London for a book about four European cities, and now the Austrian publishers wanted me to take photos of Vienna. I was given a free hand, as the other photographers were not available. I was happy to go, as things at home were not going well.

The Austrian publishers put me up at the Europa Hotel in the city center. I had been to Vienna before, but only for a short trip with my wife. It was hot and busy, and I didn't take many photos. This time, I was on my own, and I knew it would be different. I was excited to explore the city and take some great pictures.

The first day, I just rode the trams around the city, getting on and off to see the different moods of Vienna. The weather was cold and grey, like the old baroque buildings that dominated the city. I didn't want to see what the previous photographer had done; I wanted to make it my own. I just had to wait for the right moment to arrive.

A photograph is a moment, but you have to wait for that moment. So I took my time, looked around, and waited until I could see clearly. Then I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn, and the snow-covered streets were empty and magical. I couldn't take a perfect photo of the cathedral, but I could take something beautiful. Photography is always magical, and even when you understand how it works, you still feel a sense of wonder. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me.<|eot_id|>"

The Hayward Gallery in London has been transformed into a place of wonder. Instead of a big, flashy show, it's an exhibition about kinetic art, which is art that moves or explores movement. The curator, Guy Brett, has collected many interesting pieces, including paintings, drawings, and films. The exhibition doesn't have many explanations, so visitors can explore and discover things for themselves.

David Hockney is a well-known artist, but some people don't think his work is important. However, he doesn't try to be a great artist, and he knows that only time will tell if his work is truly significant.

As a curator, I once organized an exhibition called ""Window-shopping"" where artists showed their work without any theme or concept. It was a chance for people to see different art styles and enjoy them without any expectations.

Some people think that analyzing art can ruin the experience, but this is not true. Knowing more about the art can actually make it more enjoyable. Art is not just about pleasing our senses, but also about understanding the values and culture of the society we live in.

Metals

It's possible that people in the Stone Age were interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine an early human sitting by a river, waiting for a fish to come close, and accidentally finding a shiny yellow stone. They might have thought it was attractive and kept it. This could be how gold first entered people's lives. Because gold is soft, it soon became a valuable material.

Copper might have been discovered by accident too. When people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for copper ore and ways to get the copper out of it. This led to the development of metalworking, which was an important skill for our ancestors.

St Ives

We trudged down a winding street in St Ives, our bags heavy, trying to avoid the strong wind and icy waves crashing against the promenade. The streets were empty, and all the shutters on the waterfront cottages were closed tight. We had taken the small train to St Ives and watched the weather get worse. I had promised my friend a nice time, with walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire. Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it's already happened. We can't ask people who lived in the past what they did or why they made certain choices. Archaeology can give us some clues, but we can't test our ideas by experimenting with people who are alive or dead. However, we can use computer models to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, and create virtual communities that behave like real people. We can set rules for how they live and see how they react when we change things like the weather or population.

Vervet Monkeys

In a group of vervet monkeys, the dominant male noticed a strange male trying to join their group. The stranger's intentions were clear: he wanted to take over the group and become the new leader. To stop this, the dominant male came up with a clever idea. Whenever the stranger tried to approach the group, the dominant male gave an alarm call, warning the other monkeys of a leopard nearby. The stranger would quickly retreat back to the safety of the trees.

This trick worked well until the dominant male made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while walking across the open ground himself. This time, the stranger didn't retreat.

Cats and Birds

In a village in England, people collected data on their cats' hunting habits. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 prey items. A professor calculated that if this were true for all cats in Britain, they would kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, most cats are urban and have small territories, so they don't catch as many prey as the cats in this study. The question is not how many prey cats catch, but whether their hunting is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, so the bird population remains high.

Buffalo's Day

Buffaloes are an essential part of the marshman's life. They sleep on a platform or near the fire at night. In the morning, they slowly and wearily leave the platform, groaning and complaining about the long day ahead. They stand at the edge of the water, groaning again, before finally entering the water. Once in the water, they become lethargic and may wallow there for a while. They slowly move away from the house, eventually swimming and grazing on plants in the reeds and bulrushes.

Pablo Picasso painted a picture of a fishmonger's slab with a crab and scales containing fish.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a B2 level learner:

Photography has been used for over a century and a half to capture various aspects of human life and activity. During this time, photography has become more advanced in its ability to record time and space, allowing us to see both small and large things, as well as events from all over the world. Photography has also been an important way for people to express themselves and understand the world.

The idea of recording events through images is not new, however. People have been creating images for thousands of years, long before photography was invented. These early images were often used to tell stories, record events, or simply to make things more beautiful.

When photography was invented, it was seen as a way to automatically record what was happening, and it was considered a major achievement. The camera was thought to be like the human eye, capturing a fixed image that was very close to what we see. Because of this, people thought that everyone would be able to understand photographs, regardless of their background or culture.

However, as global communication has increased, we have come to realize that the photographic image is not always universal. Different cultures may interpret photographs differently, and the meaning of an image can depend on the context in which it is seen.

Photography has changed a lot since it was first invented, and its role in society has evolved. Today, photographs are often used to document historical events, but they can also be used to promote social and political change. For example, photographs played a major role in the Italian Renaissance, and they have helped shape the media culture of our time.

Writing Poetry and Other Forms of Creative Writing

Writing poetry is like walking through a minefield. You need to be careful and spontaneous, or you might make mistakes. Some people find it helpful to read a lot, write a lot, and let their imagination run free. Others might need to feel secure before they can write. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to writing.

In the short story, it's important to keep the story simple and focused. You shouldn't have too many characters or too much description. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story move forward. Dialogue is a good way to reveal different perspectives and keep the reader interested.

Screenwriting is similar to playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves carefully. It's not just about making individual decisions, but about seeing the big picture and understanding how everything fits together.

Language is a natural part of being human, but writing is not. Children learn language easily, but writing is more difficult. Writing systems have been invented only a few times in history, and most people don't learn to read and write easily. We need to understand how writing works and how children's minds work in order to teach them to write.

I'm not sure if I should call this book a novel. It's not a typical story with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it's a collection of my memories about a man I knew, but only at irregular intervals. I don't know what happened to him between our meetings. I could fill in the gaps with made-up stories, but I don't want to do that. I just want to tell what I know.

To protect the people involved, I've given them fictional names. I've also tried to make it clear that they are not famous or well-known. My book might only be interesting because of its own value, not because of who the people in it are.

I think my book will be useful for someone writing a biography about this man in the future. I haven't written down conversations word for word, but I have a good memory and I've tried to capture the essence of what was said. I've also taken some liberties with what people said, just like historians do, to make the story more engaging.

I'm a bit worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from a different background, as they are shaped by their upbringing, environment, and experiences. I've only written about people from my own culture before, and even then, it's been in short stories where you can leave out some details. In this book, I'm trying to be honest about how I see these people, not how they see themselves.

POETRY RECITALS

At any time in history, people often think that the literary scene is confusing. But looking back, it's clear that some poets are more famous than others. Today, there are many different types of poetry being written, and different opinions about what poetry should be. Some poets write for readers who will print and read their work, while others prefer to perform their poetry in front of an audience.

There is a debate between these two groups. The poets who write for readers think that the performing poets are not serious about their craft. The performing poets, on the other hand, think that the readers are too focused on the written word. This division is not absolute, and many poets do both.

In recent years, poetry readings have become more popular. Small groups in towns and cities hold events in community centers or private homes. Schools and universities invite poets to read to their students. Arts festivals also feature poetry readings.

The consequences of these events are not all positive. For poets who write for performance, readings are essential. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand, and they can be appreciated at a single hearing. However, on the page, their poems may not be as good.

Poets who are dedicated to their craft may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. These poets may try to make their work more accessible, which could mean writing something less good. Attending a poetry reading can be enjoyable, but it's not a substitute for reading poetry on the page. It's best to have the text in front of you or have read the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry readings is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for a select few.<|eot_id|>"

Oral History

When historians use oral evidence, they need to be aware of the problems that come with it. The person giving the testimony is influenced by the historian asking the questions and the setting in which they are talking. The historian's own background and way of thinking can also affect the information they get. So, historians need to take responsibility for the way they collect their evidence.

Even when the historian is not there, the person giving the testimony may not be telling the truth. They might be influenced by what they have seen or heard from others, or they might be remembering things differently because of their own feelings or experiences. This means that historians need to be careful when using oral evidence.

There are two main ways to study animals: physiology and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how animals' bodies work, while those who study whole animals look at how they behave in their natural environment. Within this approach, there are two subfields: psychology and ethology. Psychologists study how animals learn and behave in labs, while ethologists study how animals behave in the wild.

Some scientists think that studying the body's functions is more important, but others believe that studying behavior is just as important. Even if we knew everything about how an animal's body works, we would still need to study its behavior to understand it fully.

The Social Sciences

When students start studying a social science, they need to do two things at once: learn about the subject and learn how to study it. Social sciences are not just common sense; they use special methods and concepts that are unique to each field.

Each social science focuses on a different aspect of society, and each uses its own methods and ideas. The basic concepts of a subject are what make it different from common sense and what allow social scientists to go beyond everyday understanding.

Classical Architecture

In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building structures, but also about art and design. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He believed that utility and function were not as important as aesthetics.

The origins of classical architecture are complex, but it is clear that there was a long history of simple, practical building before the more sophisticated designs of ancient Greece and Italy. Despite their simplicity, these early buildings contributed to the development of classical architecture, and the temple, for example, is essentially a simple hut with a single room.

Lily was keeping a secret from her husband, Chen. She had learned to drive and was practicing around the allotments and the railway line. Chen was amused when he found out and thought Lily was great at driving. They planned a trip together, and Lily would drive them around the seaside town. Mui, Lily's sister, was a bit worried about Lily's driving, but Chen was confident in her abilities.

On the day of the trip, Lily drove perfectly, even overtaking other cars. Chen was impressed and gave her praise. They drove along the promenade and Lily parked in a quiet street. She was unsure about some road signs, so she decided to pay for parking to avoid any trouble.

After the trip, Chen joked that no one would want their old van, which made Lily and Mui upset. Chen was taken aback and apologized. He then took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. Man Kee was fascinated by the grey sea and put his hand on his father's sleeve. Chen decided to plan a future for Man Kee, hoping he would have a good education and own many restaurants one day.

As they walked along the promenade, Chen saw a ship on the horizon. He used a telescope to get a closer look and showed it to Man Kee. The ship was old and rusty, but Chen told Man Kee it was special because it would take them back home when they were finished here. Chen kissed Man Kee's head and asked Lily to look through the telescope too. However, when Lily tried, all she could see was a blurry circle of light.<|eot_id|>"

I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I told you to let me down. But I didn't think about the weight of the bucket or your lack of strength. You held the handle, and when I pushed the bucket off the side, I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange, flashing lights. It wasn't until later that I realized I had seen stars like those in cartoons.

At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what my parents would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I tried to shout back, but you called again, and I stopped. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited, then pulled myself up and climbed out of the well.

I heard my parents and you shouting and calling for help. I ran away, down to the passageway, and hid. My parents and you came looking for me. My mother was hysterical, and my father told Arthur to pull up the bucket. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows, feeling a mix of emotions.

I looked down and saw the spots of water from my wet clothes on the dry cobbles. I couldn't believe no one had seen them. My mother was still screaming, and my father was shining a flashlight down the well. I felt guilty and didn't know what to do. I had gotten revenge on you, but now I was in trouble.

I thought about what to do and decided to tell a lie. I said I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and had crawled and swum through it. But my father didn't believe me. He looked at me with a serious expression, and I felt like he was seeing me for the first time. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me with a worried expression, shaking his head. He didn't believe me either. I felt ashamed and regretful.

Susan is leaving the family home, where her children grew up. She looks around and sees the removal men, 'Removers of Distinction', packing up everything. The house is being emptied, and Susan is feeling nostalgic. She remembers the day they moved in, when they had to find a way to get a Steinway piano up the stairs. The removal men are about to take the piano, which is the last thing to go. Susan is worried about it and feels like crying. She thinks about how the piano has been a part of their lives for so long. The removal men, Fred and his team, are experienced and know how to handle the piano carefully. When they finally take it out of the house, Susan's children, Robert and Francesca, start laughing, and they all end up laughing together.

Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, made it possible for anyone to write a book review. Anyone could give a book up to five stars and write a review. This was a great idea because it allowed readers to see what others thought of a book before buying it. But this freedom also led to some problems. Some people wrote fake reviews, either to help their own books or to hurt others. Amazon had to remove these reviews, but it was hard to catch them all.

Some authors even wrote their own fake reviews to improve their book's rating. One author, Lev Grossman, did this and then wrote an article about it. Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also leave comments on their own books, but Amazon didn't always check if they were really from the author.

The most interesting thing about the reviews on Amazon was that most people took them very seriously. They wrote thoughtful and honest reviews, and they helped others decide whether to buy a book or not. George Orwell, a famous writer, once said that writing reviews of books you don't really care about is hard. But with Amazon, anyone could write a review and help others make informed decisions.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a B2 level learner:

Art in modern times is often expected to be unique, revolutionary, and shocking. We admire artists who were not appreciated in the past, but we are less tolerant of art from our own time. We expect artists to be special, with talents and drive that set them apart from the rest of us. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, and it was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and criticize them if they don't produce something extraordinary.

I'd like to describe a situation and ask a question about it. Imagine an artist chooses a text from an art book that talks about the diversity of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This is simple language and thinking, but bear with me. The artist then asks someone to create a canvas and write the chosen text on it in simple black letters. My question is: is the finished product a painting?

Artists often face pressure to stick to a successful style and genre. If they try something new, people may be upset and feel betrayed. However, some artists manage to break the mold and succeed. Eric Rimmington is an example of an artist who is now exploring a new direction by painting the London Underground. His exhibition, Underground Encounters, shows the magic of this hidden world.

In a novel, a character escapes to a remote island to heal. He is alone except for a villager who comes to clean the house. The character is neither happy nor unhappy; he is suspended in memories. He talks about the uselessness of art but also its consolations. As an artist, he finds solace in creating something that reorders reality, revealing its true meaning. For artists, there is a joyful compromise between their art and their life experiences, which helps them fulfill their potential and find meaning.

He said I had the skills and personality to be a successful lawyer, but he thought I would rather do something else. I didn't want to disappoint him, but I also didn't want to give up my own plans.

My father had always been involved in the family business, and I had grown up helping out during my school holidays. He offered to let me continue doing so until I finished university, and then I could decide if I wanted to join the business or not. I agreed, and over the next few years, I helped out occasionally.

When I was about to finish university, my father asked me to do one more important job for him. It was a big deal for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my while.

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Simon Costello knew that buying a house in Pembroke Square was a mistake soon after he and his wife Lois moved in. The house was expensive and they had to be very careful with their money. At the time, it seemed like a good idea because Simon was having a lot of successful cases and Lois was working again after having twins. She was making a good salary and they needed more space, a garden, and an au pair. But Lois wanted to live in a prestigious area, not just a suburb. She didn't want to give up her high social status.

Lois thought that one of them should take the train to work, but Simon had to do it because her office was on the other side of London. He hated his daily commute, which took 30 minutes, and spent the time thinking about how unhappy he was.

Simon's thoughts went back to his childhood, when he stayed with his grandparents in Hampstead. His grandmother was a strong supporter of his father's career and made sure he was comfortable after a long day at work. Simon felt like he and Lois were living a different kind of life now, where both partners had important careers.

Lois had always said that her career was as important as Simon's, and they needed two salaries to maintain their lifestyle. But now, their success could be ruined by Venetia, a lawyer who was angry and upset. Simon remembered their conversation and felt guilty. Venetia had accused him of not doing something important in a case four years ago, and Simon had denied it. He knew he should have said something different, but he didn't.

I chose this place to live, thinking I would find a quiet and peaceful environment. However, people in the shops soon start to recognize me, and the gardens next door, which were once loved, are now a reminder of the beauty that is passing me by. I try to forget about the summer by staying inside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have cleared some space in my small London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.

As I'm clearing, my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, appears at the window. She's a writer and often asks me to give her feedback on her work. I have a copy of her latest manuscript, which I've been meaning to read. She invites me to come down and have a drink, but I'm not keen on having her in my garden.

As we chat, Jaz mentions that she's going on holiday, and I reveal that I'm going to visit my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun. Jaz asks me what I think of her latest book, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans"". I like the title and tell her so. She asks for my honest opinion, and I suggest that she might try writing about nice people instead of focusing on herself. She becomes defensive and accuses me of being a teacher who doesn't understand the struggles of a writer. I try to give her some advice, but she's not interested.

As we finish our conversation, I feel a sense of relief when we go back inside. My calm kitchen gives me a moment of peace, but then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to say, ""I've had my moments. We nearly died.""

**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it helps us connect with our past. We usually feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. But we also need to learn about our past to understand our individual and national futures. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, which helps us feel secure about the future. It's like inheriting genes, but also a culture passed down through generations.

Some things about our heritage might not be what we like, but it's still ours. It's reassuring to feel part of something bigger than ourselves. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being. It affects our customs, traditions, and even the things we own.

In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But with the rise of industrial society, many of these stories were lost. Today, we find clues to our past in places and buildings. It's crucial to preserve and restore these links to our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I wrote a novel called Waterland, set in the Fens, a region in eastern England. People asked me why I chose this area, as I'm not from there. I chose the Fens because they seemed like an empty stage for my story. But as I learned more, I discovered the Fens are actually rich and strange. It's remarkable that this part of England is still unique and foreign to many people.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections accessible to everyone. In the past, this meant putting things in display cases with labels. Now, museums should be more engaging and interactive. They should make their collections available to a wide audience, not just display them. Museums are about more than just displays; they're about connecting people with the past.

**Architecture and Environment**

Preserving things is important, but change is inevitable. As our towns change rapidly, we need to think about what we want to preserve and how to handle change. Physical change reflects social change, so we need to learn to adapt.

Einstein is a famous scientist who is often used to advertise products that seem intelligent, like computers and encyclopedias. Many people know that he came up with some important theories, but they might not understand what they mean. These theories are called'relativity', and they changed the way scientists think about the universe.

Einstein was part of a big change in science that happened in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better by studying how things move and how they are connected. Einstein looked at the basics of the universe, like time, space, matter, and energy, and came up with new ideas.

Before Einstein, scientists thought that time and space were fixed and absolute. But Einstein said that they are not fixed, they are relative. This idea was a big change in the way scientists thought about the universe.

The writer also talks about their childhood and how they were encouraged to read by their parents. They mention that their parents would give them money to read certain books, and sometimes they would even get books with funny messages like ""This Book is NOT Literature"".

The writer also talks about the origin of human language. They quote Jacob Grimm, who said that the origin of language is a secret and amazing thing. Many people have tried to figure out where language came from, and some have come up with strange ideas. For example, one person suggested that primitive humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. Some languages have words that are related to these sounds, like the word ""malaria"" which means ""fever"".

Recently, scientists have been studying the origin of language and how it has evolved. They think that language probably developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. At first, language was used for friendly interactions and for power struggles. It was not just used for sharing information, as some people thought.

Writing Reviews: A Reviewer's Perspective

Frank Kermode, a reviewer, shares his thoughts on the craft of writing reviews. Most reviews have a short lifespan because they are written under tight deadlines and are only published for a short time. People often think that reviewing is not a valuable activity, but Kermode argues that it requires skill and expertise.

Reviewing is not just about summarizing a book in a few hundred words. It requires the ability to control one's arguments and write clearly, even when writing about complex topics. The reviewer must also consider the audience, whether it's someone who just wants a quick summary or someone who wants a more in-depth analysis.

A reviewer needs to have a broad range of knowledge and be able to write in a way that is easy to understand. Many reviewers also write other types of content, such as novels or academic papers. The American novelist John Updike, for example, writes reviews in his free time.

Some people might think that reviewers should accept that their work is temporary and not try to make it last. However, Kermode believes that reviewers should be allowed to keep their work and enjoy the recognition it brings. He himself has written many reviews and considers them an important part of his work.

In the English-speaking world, it is common for academics to write reviews, and this is seen as a way for them to share their expertise with a wider audience. Kermode believes that this arrangement is beneficial for both readers and academics, as it ensures that reviews are well-written and informative. It also reminds academics of the importance of communicating their ideas clearly to non-experts.

Overall, Kermode argues that reviewing is a valuable activity that requires skill and expertise. While it may not be the most prestigious job, it is an important way for academics and writers to share their knowledge with others.<|eot_id|>"

Ralph returned home to his flat, feeling a familiar sense of ownership. Even after three years, he still got this feeling sometimes when he came back alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he was excited to come home and see what had happened while he was away. He thought about what it would be like if someone had broken in or if there were problems with the pipes. But his flat was always just as he left it, either tidy or messy. Over time, he started to think of it as his own little world, a place where he could be himself.

Ralph sometimes felt impatient with his flat because it never changed. He would find letters and messages on the doorstep, and the answering machine would be blinking. He was grateful that nothing was broken or damaged. Ralph often looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the busy office. When he was on his own, he didn't need anyone else. But when he was at his desk, he felt the need for solitude and time to himself.

Ralph often felt lost and empty, like he was searching for himself. He would read or listen to music, but sometimes he wondered who he was doing it for. He had lost his sense of direction and his ideas seemed to get stuck in his mind. Ralph used to think he knew what he wanted, but now he wasn't so sure. He had followed a path without really thinking about it, and now he felt like he was just trying to survive.

Ralph had tried to plan his future after university, but he didn't have much ambition. He took a job at a local newspaper, which seemed like a good opportunity at the time.

Some activities cannot be rushed. For example, if you're making mayonnaise, you need to add the oil slowly or it will curdle. If you're fishing, if you pull too hard on the line, the knot will get tighter. Our minds work at different speeds too. Some things happen quickly, while others take longer. We can speed up some processes, like solving puzzles or doing mental math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to rush them, they will break down.

Our minds have different ways of thinking and learning. Some things we do quickly, without thinking, like reacting to a sudden situation. Other things we think about carefully, like solving a problem or making a decision. And then there are times when we just let our minds wander, daydreaming or relaxing. This slower way of thinking is important too. It helps us make sense of complex things, come up with new ideas, and solve difficult problems.

Scientists have recently discovered that our slower, more relaxed thinking can do many things that our conscious minds cannot. It can learn patterns that are too subtle for us to see, make sense of complicated situations, and solve problems that are hard to figure out. This is important to remember, as we often try to rush through our thinking and decision-making. Giving our minds time to wander and reflect can be just as important as using our quick thinking and problem-solving skills.

Surviving in a Foreign Land

I've been welcomed warmly to a small community of about 40 people, including scientists, students, and weather forecasters. We all live and work together, and everyone helps each other. My basic French is enough to communicate, but I struggle to have a conversation or make small talk. I miss the nuances of language and often feel lost at breakfast.

Scientists' Motivation

Here is the simplified text:

Joanna MacGregor is a famous concert pianist with a very busy schedule. Despite her busy life, she has written a book to help children learn the piano. Many people are surprised that she would take on this extra work, but she believes that the early stages of learning the piano are crucial. MacGregor has a unique approach to teaching children. She thinks that everyone should be able to learn the piano, not just exceptional children. She wants to make music accessible to people of all abilities.

MacGregor has a lot of experience teaching children. She used to teach piano lessons to many students when she was younger. She also grew up surrounded by music, as her mother taught piano lessons at their home. MacGregor's new book is designed to make learning the piano fun and enjoyable. The book includes a storyline and accompanying CDs to help children learn. The goal is to make learning the piano unadulterated fun.

MacGregor believes that practice is the key to improving. She knows that it can be difficult to practice regularly, but she thinks that it's essential. She suggests that children should work out what they want to achieve and then practice regularly. She also recommends treating themselves and playing the whole piece through, even if there are mistakes.

MacGregor's approach is different from many other piano teachers. She thinks that people should enjoy music, not just try to be perfect. She wants to help children develop a love for music and the piano, rather than just trying to make them into virtuosos.<|eot_id|>"

Dr. Johnson said that writing without effort is usually not enjoyable to read. He believed that good writing requires a lot of effort. When I look back at my old handwritten essays, I'm surprised to see how few corrections I made. Today, I would probably rewrite them five times over. I think this is because writing by hand is physically demanding and requires more attention.

The slowness of handwriting helps to discipline the brain and makes us more careful with our words. In contrast, typing on a computer can be too easy and fast, leading to careless mistakes. Many writers who use word processors spend as much time correcting their work as they would if they had written it by hand.

Emails are also different from handwritten letters. While they can be more casual, they can also be more impersonal. On the other hand, emails can be a good way to express emotions and thoughts in a more spontaneous way.

The author of this text is comparing books and electronic text. He believes that electronic text is not as good as books because it's harder to read and understand. He also thinks that electronic text is not as engaging as books because it's easier to dip in and out of, rather than reading it from start to finish.

The author also talks about the office and how it has changed over time. He describes a perfect office with a clear carpet and organized desks. However, the conversation turns to computers and how they can make work easier. The author's friend, Kathleen, is encouraging him to use computers, but he is resistant to the idea.

Lancelot's secretary, who had been making him cups of coffee for months, didn't ask if he took sugar, but stated it as a fact. This was because he usually wasn't supposed to be there, but nowadays he was often present, having discovered that taking time off would lead to chaos. Lancelot thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor to a dogsbody, always trying to stay one step ahead of problems.

The secretary handed him a folder with a label that read ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert"". Lancelot didn't want to see a synopsis, but rather a first draft. Ian Cuthbert had been given a large advance for this book, but Lancelot had already seen the synopsis and didn't want to see it again. Ian had a reputation for being difficult to work with, and his lack of progress on the book was not surprising.

Lancelot skimmed the synopsis, recognizing many phrases from before. He closed the folder, thinking that Ian's manuscript would never be finished. Ian's writing lacked the brilliance he was known for, and the synopsis seemed to lack conviction. Lancelot remembered a famous author who had struggled to finish a book, and he wondered if Ian's situation was similar.

Ian was once a promising young writer, but he had become difficult to work with over time. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he had met them. Despite his talent, he had never produced anything significant, and his creative potential remained locked away. Lancelot realized that commissioning Ian's book had been a mistake from the start.

'England's Breakfast Revolution

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is essential, but in the past, breakfast was not a common meal in England. In medieval times, there were no mentions of breakfast in literature. However, there were some exceptions. Travellers would sometimes eat before a long journey, and the sick would have breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were rich or royal.

In the 16th century, things changed. Breakfast became a normal part of daily life. Some people think that this was because food became more widely available. But others believe that there were deeper social changes that contributed to the importance of breakfast. For example, as people started working regular hours, they needed to eat a meal in the morning to give them energy. This was not just for the wealthy or noble anymore, but for everyone. Having breakfast became a necessity, not just a sign of social status.'

When a photographer takes a picture, they make choices based on their skills, personal views, and experience. They also consider social and cultural norms. This book will show how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, as well as how people respond to it.

More than a game Sport is not just a game for me. It's about having complete confidence in yourself. To be successful, you need to focus on your goal and ignore everything else. Sport is competitive, and you can't rely on others to help you. It's sink or swim.

Playing sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows me the importance of working with others. My sport allows me to excel individually, but it's also a team effort. This is similar to life - you can succeed on your own, but you can't forget about others.

Playing sport has given me many opportunities and opened my eyes to new experiences. I've seen things around the world that others may not have. However, I've also had to give up some things to achieve this.

Memories Some experiences stay with us forever. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California. I was lying awake at night, listening to a mockingbird singing in a tree outside my window. The bird's singing was so beautiful that I couldn't sleep. I felt like I was listening to a jazz or Indian classical music performance. I was amazed by the bird's improvisational skills and felt like I was experiencing something special.

Here is the simplified text:

Birds have always been an important part of human culture. We have a lot of different feelings about them, from loving them to being afraid of them. But what does this say about us? 

In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could predict their luck. Today, wrens are often found in pictures and ceramics in British homes. The wren is a special bird that holds a special place in our culture and our hearts. A forest without wrens is a sad and empty place.

People have a deep connection with birds that goes back to a time when we were more connected to nature. We developed a way of talking about birds that is different from science. This way of talking is based on stories, legends, and rhymes that have been passed down through generations.

For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed them bread. But soon, people started to see them as pests and they almost became extinct. Now, they are protected and being reintroduced to their natural habitats.

Our relationship with birds is not just about culture, but about who we are as humans. We are fascinated by birds because they can fly, sing, and are free. This fascination is a way for us to understand ourselves and our place in the natural world.

Birds have become important indicators of environmental change. Many species are endangered, which is not only a loss for the environment, but also a loss of cultural heritage. The skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are just a few examples of birds that hold special meaning in literature and folklore.

The stories and legends about birds are important because they connect us to the natural world in a way that science can't. They evoke feelings and emotions that are hard to put into words. The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past, and the mystery of the natural world.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a B2 level learner:

Maps help us understand the relationships between places and features on the Earth's surface. Two important elements are distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, such as 'a day's journey by river'. However, this method didn't provide accurate information about actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, it was more important to know where to go and how far it was, rather than the exact direction.

For a long time, written itineraries were used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing railway systems, may not show accurate directions. Landmarks along a route were initially indicated by signs, which varied in size to show their importance. The conventions used on maps varied depending on their purpose and location, so it's essential to understand the specific convention used on an old map.

The history of cartography is the story of how we've improved our ability to measure distance and direction, and how we've included more information on maps. Cartographers have borrowed ideas from other sciences, such as astronomy and geology, to improve their work. For example, they used the magnetic compass to determine direction and developed instruments to calculate angles accurately.

As people's needs changed, so did the demands on mapmakers. Travelers, soldiers, and scientists all needed different types of maps, which led to the development of new techniques and technologies. Today, cartographers create maps for a wide range of purposes, from showing geological formations to land use.

The study of historical cartography is fascinating because it shows how maps have evolved over time and how they reflect human knowledge and technology. Maps are a valuable record of the past, and understanding them can help us learn about the people who created them.<|eot_id|>"

I visited Andrew Lloyd Webber's home, which was a calm and cultured oasis amidst the chaos of his family's living space. His room was like a upgrade from a small kitchen to a luxurious lounge. I was amazed by his extensive record collection, the first stereo player I had ever seen, and the fact that a teenager had bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. Andrew was a talented composer who had won a scholarship to Oxford University to study history. He wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers, and I wanted to be a pop star. We both had big ambitions, but mine were not as all-consuming as his.

Andrew introduced me to his music, and I was impressed by his talent. He played me some of the songs he had written and produced at school, which reminded me of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a lyricist for his next project, and I was happy to help. I had written a song with an unknown pop group, which had been released as a single. We decided to work together, and I was excited to be part of something new.

I was more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but I told myself that I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I wouldn't want to miss out on the opportunity to work with him. Even if we didn't become successful, we could try to write for other famous bands. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback, and we could try to write songs for them.

The next day, I went back to my job as a trainee solicitor, but my certainty about a life in show business with Andrew had faded. I would continue to look for opportunities to sing with bands and write more songs. But I was still excited to work with Andrew and see where it would take us. We would write a musical about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a philanthropist who founded orphanages. Andrew was convinced that his score was brilliant, and I was excited to work with him. I didn't know it at the time, but I had just changed my career path.<|eot_id|>"

Language

We humans have a special ability - we can communicate with each other using language. It's so important that we can't imagine life without it. When we're with other people, we usually talk to each other. Even when we're alone, we might talk to ourselves, our pets, or even plants! I like to think of language as an instinct, like how spiders know how to spin webs. It's not something we need to learn, but rather something we naturally know how to do.

Climate and Weather

The air around us affects the lives of animals and plants. The climate can change the way a place looks. For example, warm and wet weather allows tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things. The weather is caused by big movements of air in the atmosphere. The Earth is spinning, and the air moves with it, but not at the same speed. The sun also affects the air, making it move.

Coffee

As a bar-person, I had to learn how to make coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant's coffee is very important. I had to learn how to clean and maintain the espresso machine, and how to make the perfect cup of cappuccino. It took me a while to get it right, but my boss was patient and told me that making good coffee is both an art and a science. It takes time to get the hang of it.

""Art on TV: Why is it that TV shows about art are often disappointing? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for TV because the camera can show the whole work of art and then zoom in on the details. However, I can't think of many TV shows that successfully convey the pleasure and complexity of looking at art. A good example of what goes wrong is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, American Visions. Hughes is a well-known art critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British audiences to a school of American art that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks. Instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

In my past work as a metals dealer, I learned that metals are less regulated than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it's possible to make a lot of money. However, the free-trade economists who claimed that the market would maintain the price of scarce metals were wrong. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. In fact, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago.

Recently, I was asked to investigate allegations against one of the multinational companies that benefit from these cheap raw materials.

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. Each island has its own unique character, and each has something special to offer.

Self-help books have become very popular in the US. A book by Dr. John Gray, a psychologist, became a huge success and made him a millionaire. The book helps people understand each other better, especially between men and women. The self-help industry is a big business that makes a lot of money. Many books are published, but not all of them are good. Some are just trying to make money and are not helpful.

When publishing a self-help book, editors look for something that will sell well. They want to know if the author is popular and if the book has a catchy title. The book should be easy to understand and appeal to many people.

Autobiographies are books about someone's life written by that person. Sometimes, the writer might not tell the truth because they are ashamed of something or think it's not important. They might also make up stories to make their book more interesting. The reader might not realize this and think the book is true.

Detective stories are popular too. They are like a puzzle that the reader tries to solve. The story is often about a crime and the detective who solves it. The crime is usually a symbol of something that people struggle with, like greed or lust. The detective is like a symbol of the struggle between good and bad.

Science writing is another popular genre. Stephen Jay Gould is a well-known science writer. He believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the culture and rules of science. He also thinks that writers should not simplify their language or ideas too much. They should be honest and straightforward in their writing.

Ernest Shackleton, a famous polar explorer, is being studied by American business leaders as a model of good management. Many people in the UK know who Shackleton was and what he did, but in the US, he was largely unknown until recently. Now, his story is being told and retold in books, films, and exhibitions.

Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model, looking for lessons in leadership and communication. They see him as a leader who was determined, resourceful, and able to stay calm in difficult situations. Shackleton's ability to make tough decisions, such as turning back from the South Pole when it was 97 miles away, is seen as an example of his leadership skills.

Shackleton's leadership style is also admired for his ability to communicate effectively with his team. He kept his men informed and involved in decision-making, which helped to build trust and motivation. His approach is seen as relevant to modern business, where leaders need to be able to communicate clearly and make difficult decisions.

Shackleton's story is also seen as a reminder of the importance of perseverance, optimism, and adaptability. He believed that an explorer needs to have these qualities to succeed, and these qualities are also valuable in business. As one manager put it, ""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men informed, and was willing to adapt when things didn't go as planned.""

Shackleton's story is inspiring because it shows that even in difficult situations, it is possible to stay positive and focused on the goal. His leadership style and approach to decision-making are seen as relevant to modern business, and his story is being used to teach managers about the importance of communication, teamwork, and adaptability.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B2 learner:

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a rare and unusual primate called the aye-aye. It has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by drilling into wood. The aye-aye uses its teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin finger to search for food. Scientists have been studying the aye-aye's hunting skills and have discovered how it finds the insects inside the wood.

Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University's Primate Center has been working with a few aye-ayes in captivity. He wanted to know if they could find insects just by looking for signs of their presence on the surface of the wood. He presented the aye-ayes with logs with holes drilled into them. Some holes had mealworms inside, while others were empty. The aye-ayes easily found the mealworms, even without looking for visual signs. They must have been using another way to find the insects.

Dr. Erickson tried to figure out how the aye-ayes were doing it. He discovered that they could find empty cavities as well as ones with mealworms. This meant they must be sensing the cavity itself. When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and moves its large ears forward, focusing them in front of its nose. Dr. Erickson thinks that the aye-aye is using a special way of listening and feeling for the reverberations of the taps, which indicate a hollow space below. It might also hear the insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The aye-aye's ability to find food in wood is similar to that of woodpeckers, but there are other birds that also search for insects in wood. The aye-aye's unique features, such as its continuously growing incisors and ability to gnaw through shells, make it a fascinating animal.<|eot_id|>"

Most people have photos of their grandparents, but few know what their lives were like when they were young. We often intend to write down our own stories, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes biographies of ordinary people, creating a book of at least 20,000 words with pictures if needed. This idea came to her when she talked to her family members and realized how much of the past was disappearing. She started writing other people's stories because she met people who were willing to share their experiences and enjoyed talking about them.

Ms. Renier's subjects feel comfortable opening up because they know their stories will be kept confidential. One of her subjects, a 62-year-old man, said he was surprised by what came out. He talked about his divorce and the pain it still brought him. He did it for his family, but hasn't shown it to his children yet because they were hurt by some of the things he shared.

Ms. Renier has noticed that many people's childhood experiences shape their lives. People often repeat patterns they learned from their parents, even as adults. They may marry someone their parents approved of or go in the opposite direction as a rebellion. Many people still regret or resent things from their past, even decades later.

Ms. Renier's approach is different from traditional biography writing. She keeps a distance and doesn't try to pry into people's lives. She records up to 30 hours of interviews and uses them to write the life story, rearranging the events and interpreting them. The final product is a high-quality book with a price tag of nearly £3,000. While not cheap, Ms. Renier receives about 10 inquiries a week, mostly from people who are willing to pay for a well-written and professional biography.

The people Ms. Renier works with are often from a higher social class and are used to having their stories told. They are willing to pay for a high-quality product that will be treasured by their families.<|eot_id|>"

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is a unique attraction where you can create your own wall hangings by rubbing brass plates from medieval tombs. The centre has made copies of the original plates, so you can preserve the originals and still enjoy the activity. The brass plates were used as an alternative to tomb statues in medieval Europe, and most of them were destroyed over time. Today, you can see a wide range of examples at the Cambridge Centre.

**From Here to Paternity**

I have been a father for 35 years, and I can honestly say I've loved every minute of it. I've been lucky to have children who share my interests, such as opera, theatre, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they're grown up and we've become friends rather than just parent and child.

I'm not perfect, and I've made mistakes. I've slapped my children in anger, but I don't condone physical violence. I've always tried to be available for them, and I'm here for them whenever they need me.

I was young when my children were born, and it was challenging to balance work and family life. But it's also kept me young and given me a sense of purpose. As they grew older, they introduced me to new things, like music and fashion, which has been valuable in my career.

**The Advertising Executive**

I was 25 when my children were born, and it was a big change for me. I felt old and tired, but it also kept me young. As they grew older, they showed me things I might have missed, like concerts and sports days. I'm sad I missed some of these moments, but I've made up for it by taking them on holidays and being involved in their lives.

**The Politician**

I've been a politician for a long time, and it's been challenging to balance my work and family life. I make sure to have my children with me when I can, so they can see what I do and feel included. I think more and more politicians are realizing the importance of involving their children in their lives.

**The Writer**

My first marriage ended when my daughters were young, and I had to re-evaluate my role as a father. I made an effort to stay close to them, even living next door to their mother for a while. My daughters have said I was always there for them, but I'm not sure I was the best father. I was too lenient and didn't set enough boundaries. I regret that now.

**The TV Presenter**

I was ready for children when I had my daughter. I thought it was a great idea to have a child instead of buying new furniture. Having a child has helped me understand who I am and what I want. It's a big responsibility, but it's also a great joy. A baby's smile can melt a grown man's heart and make all the hard work worth it.

'The Science of Weightlessness: A Unique Flight Experience

Journalist Tom Mumford joined a group of students on a special flight to test their scientific theories in weightless conditions. The plane, a Boeing KC-135, was converted to create a unique environment for the students to conduct their experiments. The students from Europe and America had won a competition to participate in this extraordinary flight, which was offered by the European Space Agency.

The plane took off smoothly, but the students soon realized that this was no ordinary flight. The pilot put the plane into a steep climb, and the engines roared loudly. The students felt their bodies being pressed into their seats, and then suddenly, the engines stopped, and the plane was weightless. For a few seconds, the students felt like they were floating in mid-air.

The students had 30 minutes to conduct their experiments in weightlessness. Some of them tested how objects move in zero gravity, while others studied how materials behave without gravity. One group even tested a robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how it would move in space. Another team investigated how to create solar sails that could use the sun's radiation to propel spacecraft.

The flight was an exhilarating experience for the students, who felt like they were on a rollercoaster ride. They were thrilled to have had the opportunity to experience weightlessness and to conduct their experiments in such a unique environment. As one student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I want to become an astronaut even more now.""'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make them easier to follow
* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases, such as ""a kind of state of grace at the top of each curve"" and ""the absence of gravity, with an eye to the construction of tomorrow's space stations""

I had an unusual experience when I didn't have any summers for a while. I would go to New Zealand every summer, which is their winter, and I had nine winters in a row. My parents suggested that my brother, sister, and I take care of a small plot of land and plant trees on it. If we could take the time to plant the trees, we could have the land. The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, as my father was born there.

The land was not very good for farming, but it was perfect for planting trees. I had worked on sheep stations in Australia before, so I was excited to plant trees. The rest of the family became enthusiastic as we started planting. We planted the 70 acres of land over four years, from 1968 to 1972. It was a challenging time, as it rained almost every day. But we enjoyed the process, and it was a great experience.

I had a friend who was an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful for me. We would fill bags with trees and then plant them along a line. It was hard work, but it made me fit. After a while, we got into a rhythm and could plant trees quickly and easily. The process was mentally interesting, and I started to think about the natural world and our place in it.

I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and have watched the trees grow. It's been satisfying to see how well they've done. I sometimes worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but overall, it was a successful project. I even wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" while I was there. The connection I feel to that place is still strong, and it's a powerful bond between people and the earth.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

We turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago. We've helped many orphaned animals, but the latest ones were a surprise. A helper brought us a cardboard box with three small grey badger cubs inside. They were only eight inches long and had milky-coloured eyes. We had never seen badger cubs before. The mother had been killed, and the babies were cold and hungry. We took them in and fed them with a syringe, mimicking the mother's licking. After a few days, they started drinking from a bottle and moving around. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.

As they grew, we noticed that Willow seemed sick, but we didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late. He died from a lung infection. We were sad, but we continued to care for the other two. A few days later, a local farmer found another male cub, and we named him Willow II. He was smaller and harder to feed than the others. It took him a while to get used to eating solid food, but eventually, he learned.

As the summer went on, the cubs grew and became more active. They started going on walks at night, and we would join them in the cider orchard. They would chase each other and even us, but we learned to avoid their playful attacks. As they got bigger, we noticed that other badgers were visiting our field, probably looking for food. We were warned that they might attack our cubs, so we put up a fence to keep them out.

The local press took pictures of us with the cubs, and people were so interested that we started an appeal to build a badger sett for them. We designed and built a special home with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. The cubs explored it before going on their walks, and eventually, they forgot about their walks and just enjoyed their new home.

In the end, we built a special home for the badgers, and they moved in. We would visit them occasionally, and they would still come to say hello. This is their territory now, and they have come to know it well.<|eot_id|>"

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to recreate a historic voyage made by Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer, to chart the variations of the compass. Halley's journey took him across the Atlantic Ocean in the 17th century. He was trying to find the difference between magnetic north and true north, which was important for navigation.

Halley's voyage was a groundbreaking achievement. He was one of the first scientists to conduct research at sea, and his findings were crucial for sailors to navigate the oceans accurately. Unfortunately, his initial trip was cut short due to crew insubordination, but he returned to the seas and completed his mission.

To commemorate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey, Dr. Clark plans to recreate the voyage. He wants to update the measurements made by Halley and provide more accurate data for navigation. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have offered to supply instruments for the expedition.

Dr. Clark is a keen sailor and has spent time in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. He is fascinated by Halley's achievements and wants to give him the recognition he deserves. Dr. Clark believes that the expedition will not only be a tribute to Halley but also provide valuable scientific data.

The expedition will take four stages, with four different crews, and will cover over 13,000 kilometers. Dr. Clark is willing to spend eight months at sea to complete the journey. He hopes that his measurements will help to refine the model of the Earth's magnetic field and provide a better understanding of the changes in the magnetic field.

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This has puzzled scientists for a long time. How do peacocks get away with having such an extravagant feature in a world where nature is competitive? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are trying to find the answer.

Charles Darwin believed that living creatures evolved over time through a process called natural selection. This means that the individuals best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and have offspring. However, the peacock's tail doesn't seem to be useful for survival. Darwin thought that females liked the peacocks' tails because of their beauty, but his friend Alfred Russel Wallace disagreed. He believed that the hens must be choosing the males with the best tails because they have some other quality that is not obvious to humans.

For a long time, scientists have tried to study the behavior of peafowl, but it's difficult. However, the 200 birds at Whipsnade offer a unique opportunity to observe them. Marion Petrie and her team have identified two main questions: Do hens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? And do the peacocks with the most impressive tails have some advantage that helps them survive?

The team has observed that hens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. However, it's not clear whether these males are also healthier or stronger. The team is now studying the offspring of the attractive and unattractive males to see if there are any differences.

There is also a theory that showy male birds are less likely to have parasites, and their bright plumage advertises their health. However, the team has not been able to test this theory in the Whipsnade peacocks.

In the past, a mathematician and biologist named R A Fisher proposed an idea called 'Fisher's Runaway'. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit their father's tail and their daughters will inherit their mother's preference for long tails. This could create a feedback loop where the males with the longest tails get more mates and leave more offspring, and the females' preference for long tails increases over time. This theory could explain why peacocks have such long tails.

This theory also vindicates Darwin's idea that females might choose males for their beauty, even if it doesn't seem useful for survival.<|eot_id|>"

MY DREAM BOAT I believe that the best boat design combines old and new ideas. I built my own boat, 'The Westerman', using traditional methods, but with modern technology. It's not like the fancy yachts at the London Boat Show, which are all about new technology. My boat looks old, but it's actually a modern design. I wanted to create a boat that is both functional and beautiful.

I've always believed that a boat should be a boat, not a floating house. I've had many boats in the past, but my favorite was an old boat called Hirta. She was simple, with no fancy electronics or modern comforts. But she was easy to sail and taught me a lot about the sea.

When I was injured, I had to sell Hirta, but I couldn't find a new boat that I liked. So, I decided to build a new one from scratch. I worked with a designer, Nigel Irens, who used computer software to help us create the design. We made a model of the boat and tested it before building it.

The result is 'The Westerman', a boat that is both beautiful and functional. She's sailed across the Atlantic and has won several races. I'm very proud of her. I think she's proof that you don't need the latest technology to have a great boat. Sometimes, it's better to go back to traditional methods and listen to the wisdom of the past.

**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Many health farms and country house hotels are very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places. Here are their reports.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I spent six days at Henlow Grange, a beautiful 18th-century house. My room was very comfortable, and I felt relaxed immediately. I did nothing on the first day, but from the second day, I started going to exercise classes and doing many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and massages. The staff were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic. They are planning to add a swimming pool and a light diet room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or take a peaceful walk in the garden. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy.

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. The moment you enter, you feel at ease. The house has a big library, a charming conservatory, and plenty of space. On arrival, everyone has a medical check-up, which includes an examination and a check on weight and blood pressure. You are given a specific diet to follow. The food is tasty and nicely presented, and you can also have massages or water therapy. The staff are friendly and professional.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it's a lovely old manor house with a warm atmosphere. If you're counting calories, you might want to miss out on the delicious food, which is prepared by a French chef. There's a gym, a pool, and a spa bath, steam room, and sauna. You can also get a sports injury clinic. I got an expert opinion on an old shoulder injury and received some good advice.

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Humanity and animals are more similar than we think. In fact, we are 98% genetically identical to chimpanzees, our closest relatives. This means that any differences between us and animals must be due to a small number of genes. Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use tools, and some animals even have their own languages.

The only thing that really sets us apart from animals is art. But why did humans develop art so recently, considering we've been around for millions of years? The earliest evidence of human art dates back to around 35,000 years ago, in the form of cave paintings, statues, and jewelry. What makes human art different from animal art? Three main differences are often cited: human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure, and it's transmitted through learning rather than genetics.

Let's examine these claims. While human art may not serve a practical purpose, it does communicate something to others. In contrast, animal behaviors, like birdsong, serve a specific function. As for aesthetic pleasure, it's hard to know whether animals enjoy the beauty of their songs, but they do sing mainly during the breeding season, suggesting it may serve a purpose.

The third claim is that human art is learned, rather than instinctive. While humans can learn different art styles, some animals inherit their songs or behaviors. The speed at which human art styles change is also unique, unlike animal behaviors that remain relatively constant.

However, a study of chimpanzees painting art challenges these distinctions. In the 1950s, two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, created art for their own satisfaction, and some of their paintings even sold at an art show. This raises questions about what makes human art truly unique. While human artists may intend to communicate through their art, the chimpanzees' indifference to communicating with others doesn't necessarily mean their art is any less meaningful.<|eot_id|>"

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It's also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. There aren't many big adventures left, and even fewer heroes. I thought I wouldn't find any real-life heroes, but then I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's big adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. It's a very challenging place, and the local people call it the Desert of Death. He told me about the dangers and excitement of the journey in a calm atmosphere at his family home.

The team he led had four British people, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The handlers had never worked with camels before, but they were long-distance truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous.

The team set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's harshest desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating book about their journey. He had just left the Army after 14 years and wanted to try something new. He wanted to prove to himself that he could do it.

Tina, his wife, was worried that he wouldn't come back because nobody had done that route before. It took them 59 days to cross the desert, and it was very kind to them. But they still faced many challenges: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and dehydration.

Blackmore explains that they were at their limits when they found some water. They didn't experience the famous sandstorms or the freezing cold that could have stopped them. But they still had many problems: sand got into their blisters and wounds, and climbing the high dunes was very difficult.

What kept him going was the need to survive. They had no backup plan, and no aircraft flew over them once they entered the sandhills. He was scared of his physical ability to complete the journey, but he knew he had the mental strength.

When they finished, they were very tired but proud of what they had achieved. Blackmore says that he is proud of this expedition more than anything else he has done. He still thinks about the desert and the sense of purpose they had.

Now, Blackmore misses the challenge and the freedom of the desert. He finds it hard to be part of modern life, which is too uniform for him.<|eot_id|>"

I had a frustrating experience with my malfunctioning word processor, which made me realize that gadgets can be a hassle. I've started to get rid of some of our household technology as it breaks down, and I've discovered the joys of doing things by hand.

I've found that sewing by hand is a great way to relax and be productive at the same time. I can listen to the radio or talk to family and friends while I sew. It's also nice to have a cup of tea and sit by the fire while I work. I used to think that sewing by hand was a tedious and time-consuming task, but I've found that it's actually quite enjoyable.

What does it mean to be an eccentric? An eccentric is someone who behaves in a way that is different from what is considered normal in their society. But what is normal, really? We all have our own quirks and things that make us different. For example, some people love entering competitions, collecting unusual items, or writing letters to the newspaper about things that bother them. Being eccentric is about being true to ourselves and our individuality.

Most of us have a mix of two forces inside us: the desire to be like everyone else and the desire to be different. The desire to fit in and be accepted is usually stronger. That's why people who have unusual hobbies or opinions often join groups of others who share their interests. This way, they can be themselves and feel accepted.

We all have this struggle between being like everyone else and being our own person. We might pretend to fit in, but deep down, we want to be different. Some people, like famous singers or artists, have become successful by being true to themselves and their individuality.

But being eccentric is not just about doing something unusual. It's about being natural and genuine. Eccentrics don't try to be odd; they just are. They don't worry about what others think of them. They do what they do because it's who they are.

This is different from people who do unusual things to get attention or to rebel against society. Eccentrics are not aware of the world around them; they just do what they do because it feels natural to them.<|eot_id|>"

We asked four naturalists to tell us about the book that has had the greatest influence on them. I, Geoffrey Lean, had the chance to meet some of the pioneers in the field. One of them was Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was at the heart of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She wrote many important books, but one that stands out to me is ""The Home of Man"". It's a classic book that talks about the growth of cities and how we can live in harmony with nature.

Linda Bennett chose ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen. This book is about animal communication and is full of interesting facts and pictures. It shows how animals work together in colonies and how they communicate with each other.

Lee Durrell's favorite book is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book is a memoir about his family's adventures with animals. It's a heartwarming story that made Lee realize how important it is to care for the natural world.

Bruce Pearson chose ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher. This book is a comprehensive guide to birds, with beautiful paintings by Eric Ennion. It's a book that inspired Bruce to appreciate birds not just as objects of study, but as a source of inspiration for art and literature.

Publisher A: Reviews are very important for us. In fact, a survey found that many readers choose a book based on reviews more than any other factor. Authors are also affected by reviews, but publishers are more concerned with the number of words written about the book rather than the content.

Publisher B: Publishers and the press have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to promote their books. Reviews are important, but they should be balanced and varied. Unfortunately, some books, especially paperbacks, often don't get the attention they deserve.

Publisher C: Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Without them, we wouldn't be able to reach readers. We publish books by authors who aren't well-known, so we need reviews to get the word out. Good reviews can be very effective in selling books, especially if they come from respected reviewers.

Publisher D: The relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK is complex. In the US, a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, it's harder to predict how reviews will affect sales. Sometimes, even badly reviewed books become bestsellers.

Publisher E: Everyone wants long, positive reviews, but do they really sell books? I published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn't do well. People thought they could learn everything they needed to know from the reviews and didn't need to buy the book. The name of the reviewer can still influence people's decisions, but it's not as important as it used to be.

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, had a successful book called The Horse Whisperer. Even before it was published, people were excited about it. The book was his first novel and it earned him a lot of money. Evans talked to us about his inspiration and his success.

At the beginning of the year, Evans had a difficult time. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about his bank account. He had no income for two years and was struggling to pay his bills. Instead of getting a job, Evans decided to take a risk and go to America to research his first novel. He had always been interested in horses and had met a farrier who told him about a ""horse whisperer"" who could calm down aggressive horses. Evans was fascinated and started researching the subject.

He spent three months in the US, visiting horse ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. It was a challenging time for him, as he was alone and struggling to make ends meet. He had tried to make a living as a filmmaker for ten years, but it wasn't working out. He was in debt and worried about how he would feed his family.

After returning home, Evans wrote the first half of his book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent, and he liked it. The agent thought Evans could get $30,000 as an advance on the book. Evans needed more money to pay off his debts and keep his family going, so he was hesitant. He decided to write a summary of the rest of the book and sent it to seven UK publishers.

The response was overwhelming. Within a week, he received an offer of $75,000, and soon after, the book was sold to two major publishers for record-breaking advances. Evans was amazed and couldn't believe his luck. The book became a huge success, and soon, Hollywood studios were fighting over the rights to turn it into a film.

Evans decided not to write the screenplay himself, as he wanted to maintain his independence. He was happy with the success of his book and was considering writing another one.<|eot_id|>"

Bobby Fischer is back in the chess world after 20 years. He's 49 years old and playing against his old rival Boris Spassky. Fischer's first game was impressive, but he's not the same player he was 20 years ago. He's out of practice and not as fit as he used to be. Spassky is also older. The game of chess has changed a lot since Fischer's time. Today, chess is more about winning than about being a genius. Players need to be good at math, memory, and strategy, but they also need to be able to handle the pressure. The game is getting longer and more intense, and players need to be able to focus for hours.

Young players are doing better than older ones because they are more used to the pressure. Most of the top players are under 30 years old. The way players prepare for a game has also changed. They use computers to study their opponents' moves and look for weaknesses. This makes it harder for older players to compete.

Playing chess is not just about being smart; it's also about being physically fit. A game can last for hours, and players need to be able to concentrate for a long time. The pressure is intense, and players need to be able to handle it. Losing is not an option, and winning brings a lot of satisfaction.

Bobby Fischer is back to prove he's still the best, but it's a tough challenge. He's older and out of practice, and the game has changed a lot. Whatever happens, he'll get a lot of money, but it might not be enough to make up for the physical and mental exhaustion of playing at the top level.<|eot_id|>"

Volunteer Tourism: Is it Really Helping?

A. When people travel to help others abroad, it's hard to say if they're actually making a big difference. While they might build homes or schools, they often pay a lot of money to do it. This means that if they just donated the money, it could help more people than the volunteer could. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who don't need special skills or experience. Some people wonder if they're really helping or just trying to look good for their careers.

B. Volunteering can bring people together and help solve problems. It can also help people participate in global issues and build connections with others. This can be good for everyone involved. However, if only wealthy people from rich countries volunteer, it might not help those who need it most. The volunteers will get benefits, but the host communities won't.

C. International volunteering can be good or bad. It can be a way for wealthy Westerners to help others, but it can also be a way for them to help themselves. At its best, volunteering brings benefits to both the volunteers and the host communities. It can also raise awareness about unfair power relationships and help people understand the root causes of poverty and inequality.

D. Volunteer tourism seems to fit with the idea of ""making a difference"" in a simple way. It bypasses big government and business, which can be seen as positive. However, it also avoids the need for real change and can make people think that helping others is just about individual acts of charity. This can be a problem when volunteer tourism is marketed as a way to solve big development problems. It's important to remember that volunteering should be about making a real difference, not just looking good.

Waking Up to Music

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need a little help to get out of bed. That's where clock radios come in. But how do you choose the right one? Our panel, consisting of myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different models.

We looked at the ""dual alarm function"" on one model, which allows you to set two different wake-up times for work days and weekends. However, this feature is not as useful as it seems, as it only allows you to set two different times, not to wake up and then snooze and wake up again.

One model stood out for its quality radio and built-in cassette player. You can fall asleep listening to your favorite music and wake up to a gentle alarm. The radio quality is excellent, but the clock radio itself is quite large.

Another model was voted the best overall winner. Paul Bridges loved its digital display and wide snooze bar, which makes it easy to silence the alarm without opening your eyes. The clock also has a self-power backup, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out.

However, some of us found the model's design to be a bit tacky, and the instructions were difficult to follow. Tom Granger thought the built-in lamp was unnecessary and hard to position.

We also tested a model that is popular among young people, with its brightly colored casing and matching strap. It's easy to set up and has a traditional design that makes it easy to use. However, the alarm can be a bit unreliable, and the manual notes that it may sound 10-20 minutes earlier or later than the set time.

Finally, we tested the simplest and cheapest model, which has old-fashioned dial tuning. Tom Granger liked it because it's easy to use and takes up little space. However, the radio quality is not as good as some of the other models, and the tuning is a bit crude.

Overall, choosing the right clock radio depends on your personal preferences and needs.<|eot_id|>"

'Hedgehogs are small mammals covered in sharp spines. They can be found in many parts of the world, except in America and Australia. One special feature of hedgehogs is that they can curl up into a ball when they feel threatened, with their spines pointing outwards. This helps protect them from predators. The effectiveness of this defence depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines and are more likely to try to run away from danger. They only roll into a ball as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep a lot during the day, often hiding in bushes or underground holes. Although hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them choose to do so. In suitable conditions, some hedgehogs stay awake all year round.'

""Women in Sports: Beating the Odds

It's not easy to be a successful athlete, especially for women. They have to be twice as tough as men. Training and competitions take up most of their time, leaving little room for a normal life. But despite the challenges, women are making progress and breaking records.

We spoke to five exceptional British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, 27, Skier
""It's an amazing feeling to ski fast and land safely. But it can be scary, especially when the weather is bad. We train for 10 months a year, which means we have to give up a lot of our social life. But it's our choice. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete together.""

B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist
""I started cycling two years ago and won a charity race. I was paid well as a professional cyclist, and I've had many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I'm successful because of how I look, not because I'm a good cyclist. So I focus on my training and fitness.""

C. Annabel, 26, Rower
Rowing is a challenging sport for women because few schools offer it. Most women start rowing at a later age, which makes it harder to compete at an international level. However, I love being fit and the social life is great.

D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker
I've always dreamed of walking around the world. I've had to overcome many challenges, including pain and blisters. But I've set records and earned sponsorship money. Some people think women are more likely to fail, so it's harder to get sponsored.

E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer
As a woman in a male-dominated sport, I've faced many challenges. Some men are aggressive and try to beat me. But I'm naturally competitive and aggressive, and I love the thrill of racing.

F. Alison, 28, Triathlete
As a triathlete, I have to train hard and push myself to the limit. It's not easy, but I love the feeling of being fit and the social aspect of the sport. I'm part of an International Triathlon Women's Commission, which is working to improve the sport for women.""

I was 18 years old and traveling around Europe and Morocco in a old van. I was running out of money, so I took a job painting boats on the waterfront in Cannes. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in the harbour. He was an 80-year-old man, but he was still very recognizable. I was amazed to see him, as he was known to be a private person who rarely went out in public.

I had a sketchbook with me, and I decided to approach him and ask for his signature. To my surprise, he agreed. He even drew a beautiful design on the page. I was so happy that I started talking to him and told him about my love of art and my admiration for his work. An American woman at the table acted as our interpreter, as Picasso's English was limited.

After lunch, my friend suggested that I should ask Picasso if I could draw his portrait. I was nervous, but I decided to go back and ask. Picasso agreed, and I started drawing. He was a bit mischievous and acted out different expressions, making it difficult for me to draw him. But I persisted, and he eventually relaxed and let me study him. I was struck by his youthful appearance, despite his age, and his piercing eyes.

When I finished the drawing, Picasso looked at it and nodded. Then, to my surprise, he took the crayon and drew a portrait of me. His drawing was much better than mine, and I was amazed. He handed the sketchbook back to me, and I thanked him. I asked him to sign the drawing, but he said I already had his signature. I was grateful for the experience and felt lucky to have met Picasso.

**How Shops Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone to a store and ended up buying more than you planned? Shops use many tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:

**A. Fresh and Clean**

Supermarkets know that customers like to buy fresh food. That's why they often put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance of the store. They may also have a bakery that makes the store smell like fresh bread. The color of the store can also make it feel fresher.

**B. Displaying Products**

Where products are placed in a store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to track which products sell well and put them in easy-to-reach places. They also put high-priced items near the entrance to catch your attention.

**C. Spreading Out Staples**

Supermarkets put everyday items like bread and milk in different parts of the store. This makes you walk past other products that are more expensive. Chain stores do the same with products they are known for, hoping you will look for them and buy more.

**D. Making You Think You're Getting a Good Deal**

Some stores make their products look more exclusive by displaying only a few items at a time. This makes you think you're getting a special deal. But the products are still mass-produced.

**E. The Total Bill**

Shoppers are more likely to buy more if they focus on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix high and low-priced items to make you think you're getting a good deal.

**F. The Price Tag**

Shoppers are more likely to notice individual prices in chain stores, so stores make sure to highlight the price of each item. This also helps prevent shoplifting.

**G. Lighting**

Stores use lighting to make products look good. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh food look fresh, while chain stores use natural-looking lighting to show off clothes.

**H. Guiding You Through the Store**

Chain stores use different carpeting to guide you through the store. This makes you follow a certain path and look at products along the way.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

Supermarkets use big pictures and videos to make you want to buy certain products. Some stores even have screens on shopping carts that show you ads as you shop. This is designed to make you buy more on impulse.

Chris Bonnington, a famous mountaineer, and Robin Knox-Johnston, a sailor, teamed up to go on an adventure to Greenland. They wrote a book about their trip, called Sea, Ice and Rock. I was working on a book about adventure and asked Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him on his yacht and I accepted. We sailed and climbed together in Greenland. I was impressed by Robin's ability to stay calm in tricky situations.

Robin and I became good friends during our trip. He's a natural leader who likes to involve everyone in decision-making. I, on the other hand, found the sailing part of the trip boring and felt a bit useless at times. Robin, being a sailor, enjoyed fixing the engine and other tasks. When we reached Greenland, I had to take responsibility for Robin's safety, which was a big challenge for me.

We attempted to climb Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, but it was much harder than we expected. Robin, who isn't a natural climber, was very determined and put his trust in me. We had to turn back, but he accepted it. On the way back, we had a disagreement about who would take watch on the yacht.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. But in recent times, we're in danger of losing the variety of apples we have today.

The history of apples dates back to prehistoric times. People ate apples and threw away the seeds, which grew into new trees. In ancient times, people in Europe and Asia grew apples and stored them for the winter.

In the Middle Ages, people in Britain grew apples and made cider. They also introduced new apple varieties from other parts of Europe. Some apples were popular for eating fresh, while others were used for cooking.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in Britain and North America grew apples and took them with them when they traveled to new lands. The Pilgrims, who sailed to America on the Mayflower, brought apple seeds with them.

In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer in Iowa discovered a new type of apple that became very popular. It was called the 'Delicious' apple and is still widely grown today.

Another famous apple variety is the Granny Smith, discovered by Maria Anne Smith in Australia. She found a small tree growing in a pile of discarded fruit and transplanted it. The tree grew and produced a new type of green apple that became famous worldwide.

Today, apples are grown all over the world, but many varieties have been lost over time. Commercial growers often choose apples that are easy to transport and have a red skin, rather than those that taste good. However, consumers are starting to demand more variety in their apples, and it's important that we protect the diversity of apples for the future.

Richard Nerurkar, a top British distance runner, visited a training camp in Kenya. The camp is located 10 miles south of the equator, near the foot of Mount Kenya, the highest peak in Kenya. For three years, Richard had been training at this camp during the winter months. But this time, he decided to stay with the Kenyan runners at their national team training camp.

Richard was invited to join the Kenyan team after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000-meter race. He was excited to train with the Kenyans and learn about their training methods. The Kenyans are known for their success in distance running, and Richard wanted to know why.

At the training camp, Richard saw that the Kenyans had a simple and uncomplicated approach to running. They ate a simple diet, ran in a relaxed way, and seemed to enjoy competing. But Richard was curious about their training routine. The Kenyans did three workouts a day, with a total distance of about 40 kilometers. They also had a relaxed daily routine, with no complicated preparations for breakfast or dinner.

Advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic recession. The problem is that advertising has not kept up with the changing economy. Advertisers often think in terms of big markets and big media, but as more brands and media have appeared, target markets have become smaller. As a result, even big brands often don't target the right people.

Let's think about our own shopping habits. When we go to the supermarket, we might buy 30-50 items. But most of these won't be advertised brands. In fact, we probably only buy a few hundred different brands in a year. And it's the same with other things like cars, clothes, and services. We don't buy many different brands.

According to a study, there are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. But most people don't buy more than 400 of these brands in a year. In fact, the average person buys only 4% of the brands they see advertised.

When we watch TV, we might see a few commercials for brands we buy or might buy in the future. But most commercials are for brands we don't care about. This means that most advertising is wasted.

However, advertising can still be effective. It's a cheap way to reach a lot of people, even if we can't know exactly who will respond. The key is to target the right people with the right message. This is harder than it sounds, but it's the best way to make advertising work.

In the past, advertisers thought that every reader of a publication or every viewer of a commercial break would rush out and buy all the advertised brands. But this is not the case. People only pay attention to a few ads and ignore the rest. This means that waste is inevitable.

Despite this, advertising can still be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proven this. The key is to use smart targeting to minimize waste and reach the right people.<|eot_id|>"

Meet Charles Clover, a pioneer in building environmentally-friendly homes. He visits a special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which is considered the greenest dwelling in Britain. The house was designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale, two architects who have been passionate about sustainability for a long time.

The house is designed to be self-sufficient, using rainwater for washing and drinking, and recycling its sewage into compost for the garden. The Vales also use waste heat from appliances and their own body heat to keep the house warm. The house is so well-insulated that it's almost silent inside, and it's hard to hear any noise.

The Vales have been interested in green architecture for a long time and have written a book on the subject. They wanted to show that it's possible to build a house that is good for the environment without sacrificing comfort. They designed the house to be energy-efficient, using natural materials and minimizing waste. The house doesn't use mains water, and the Vales collect and filter their own water from the roof.

The house is also equipped with special features, such as a wood-burning stove that they only use in the coldest winter months. The Vales believe that people should be able to live comfortably without relying on central heating. They also have a small solar panel system that will generate electricity and even charge an electric car.

The house is surprisingly warm, even in winter, thanks to its insulation and design. The Vales claim that it's comfortable to live in, and they don't need to use the heating system much. They believe that people should adopt a more sustainable lifestyle and live in harmony with the environment.

The house was built at a reasonable cost, using local materials and craftsmen. However, the commercial building companies are not interested in adopting this approach, as it would require a significant change in their business practices.

Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was a rational person who believed in science. However, in 1920, he was convinced that photographs of fairies in a garden were real. He wrote an article and published the photos, saying that fairies were supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos confessed that they had faked them. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among the flowers. The photos are still beautiful, but the trick shows that the camera can be tricked. This is not new - even from the beginning of photography, people have been altering reality. With modern computer software, we can easily change our digital photos. So, it's not true that there was ever a time when photography was completely honest.<|eot_id|>"

Blacksmiths have always been important in human history, and their work has often been admired and respected. In the past, blacksmiths were considered as valuable as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also known for their artistic skills. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for famous buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. In the past, ironwork was a key part of French and Belgian architecture. However, by the late 1960s, blacksmiths were almost extinct in Britain because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects didn't use decorative ironwork like they used to.

Recently, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and interior design, and blacksmiths are once again in demand. However, some of the work being done today looks similar to what was done in the past. Many manufacturers still make gates and balconies that look ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style"". You can even find rusty candlesticks with decorations in trendy design stores.

Luckily, there are also some talented blacksmiths who are creating unique and beautiful pieces. The British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is promoting the craft with an exhibition of ironwork at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. The exhibition features over 250 pieces, including bookends, a spiral staircase, and even an eight-foot gate. The money raised from the sale of these pieces will go to the individual artists and also to promote good ironwork.

The blacksmiths are excited about the new possibilities offered by modern power tools, which have freed them from the hard work of hammering hot metal. They can now shape, bend, and weld metal with ease. As one blacksmith says, ""This material allows us to express ourselves in a way we never could before.""<|eot_id|>"

I QUIT SMOKING AND PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED. ONE COLLEAGUE WAS EVEN ANGRY. 'WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP SOONER?' SHE ASKED. I couldn't explain how I had gone from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. I went to a stop-smoking session, which was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I thought it was unfair to be pressured to quit by the anti-smoking campaign. Plus, I didn't have any health problems and I felt fine. I went to the session to write an article about people trying to give up smoking. I told the counsellor I wouldn't be trying to stop, as it wouldn't be fair. But during the session, I noticed I didn't want to smoke as much as I used to. The room was filled with smoke, but I didn't feel like smoking as much as the others. I think what happened was that the idea of quitting started to make sense to me. It was like a challenge, and I felt powerful when I thought about not smoking. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone else. Quitting was easy, and I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms. The only thing that was difficult was doing nothing on weekends, as I used to smoke when I was bored. Now, I miss smoking sometimes, but not too much. I have to get used to new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane, without smoking.<|eot_id|>"

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel Prize. You might think that she would be a well-known figure in the UK, but many people don't know much about her. I've been asking my friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them don't know who she is.

Hodgkin was a remarkable person who made significant contributions to science. She was a pioneer in her field, and her work had a big impact on our understanding of the world. She was also a woman who lived through many important events in the 20th century, including the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.

When I started researching her life, I was surprised to find that there weren't many books about her. This is partly because scientists are often seen as being less interesting than artists or writers. However, this is unfair. Scientists can lead fascinating lives, and their stories can be just as compelling as those of anyone else.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in scientific biographies and autobiographies. These books can help to make scientists more relatable and human. They can also show that scientists are not just experts in their field, but people with personal lives and emotions.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a dedicated scientist who loved her work. She made important discoveries in the fields of chemistry and biology, and her work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the world. She was also a devoted mother and wife, and her personal life is an important part of her story.

Unfortunately, many people do not understand scientific concepts and may find it difficult to appreciate the importance of scientific inquiry. However, this does not mean that science is boring or uninteresting. On the contrary, science is a fascinating and important field that can help us to understand the world around us.

It is sad that many people do not know about Dorothy Hodgkin's achievements, but it is also an opportunity to learn more about her and the importance of science in our lives.<|eot_id|>"

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability to find water underground. She can hold a forked hazel rod and sense where the water is. This skill is in high demand among farmers whose wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business, but they use a unique method to locate water. They use technology like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers, but Margaret also relies on her'sixth sense'.

Dowsing, the ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground, is a mysterious skill. There are different theories about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual explanations. Some scientists believe that everything on Earth vibrates, and dowsers can sense these vibrations. Margaret and her husband have a high success rate, with over 90% of their wells finding water.

The Wilkins have been busy during the recent drought, with a long waiting list. Most of their customers are farmers with dry wells or people building holiday homes in remote areas. Margaret tries to find water at a depth of 50-70 meters. She looks for areas with good rock formations and electricity nearby to power the pump.

To find water, Margaret starts by using a pendulum on a map. She then walks over the area with the forked hazel stick, feeling a strange sensation when she's above the water. She uses the stick to pinpoint the exact spot to drill. Her husband also dowses the area, and they usually agree on the best spot. If they don't agree, they keep searching until they do.

Margaret's ability to find water is not unique. Many people have been fascinated by this skill, and scientists have studied it. Margaret calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment"", and it's the best explanation for her success. Without this skill, the Wilkins wouldn't be able to run their business.

Have you ever dreamed of switching lives with someone for a day? We made it happen for four people. Let's hear their stories.

Amanda, a young mother of two, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a waitress at a popular London restaurant. Amanda was surprised by how busy and noisy the restaurant was. She struggled to carry a tray of drinks and accidentally spilled them. Despite feeling embarrassed, she enjoyed the experience and learned that waitressing requires being bubbly, organized, and able to handle a lot of customers. She realized that it's not just about being a mother, but also about being able to manage a busy job.

Cindy, on the other hand, swapped lives with Amanda and became a mother for the day. She found it exhausting taking care of two young children, making sure they ate, bathed, and went to bed on time. She also had to do household chores, which she didn't expect. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the experience and realized that being a mother is a tough job that requires a lot of energy and patience.

Rosemary, a dairy farmer, swapped lives with Hilary, a teacher at a primary school. Rosemary was surprised by how busy the school was and how much work teachers have to do. She helped with lessons, attended a staff meeting, and even participated in a physical education class. She found it difficult to stand in front of the class and speak, but enjoyed the experience. She realized that teaching is a challenging job that requires a lot of energy and dedication.

Hilary, on the other hand, swapped lives with Rosemary and became a dairy farmer for the day. She was surprised by how early farmers have to get up and how much work they have to do every day. She helped with milking cows, feeding calves, and inspecting sheep. She found it physically demanding and realized that farming is not just about working with animals, but also about managing a business.

All four people learned that their jobs are not as easy as they thought, and that there are many challenges involved. They appreciated the experience and gained a new respect for the people who do these jobs every day.<|eot_id|>"

Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player from Sweden. Despite his parents not being musical, he started playing the trumpet at a young age and became one of the best in the world. He has recorded many new pieces and performs in concert halls around the world.

Hardenberger's parents gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present when he was eight years old. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, bought a real trumpet instead of a toy one. The boy loved playing it and his mother arranged for him to take lessons from a professional trumpet player.

Hardenberger's teacher, Bo Nilsson, was very good and helped him develop his skills. Hardenberger has said that he is grateful for his teacher's guidance and support. He believes that the trumpet is a simple instrument, but it's difficult to make it sound perfect. He has learned to accept its imperfections and make the best of them.

Hardenberger has always wanted to be a solo artist, unlike some other famous trumpet players who started in orchestras. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and wanted to be like him. He studied in Paris with Pierre Thibaud, who taught him that playing in an orchestra is not the only way to be a great trumpet player.

Hardenberger has a special gift for communicating with his audience through his music. He doesn't know exactly what this gift is, but he knows that it's what makes his music special. He believes that music has the power to move people and make them feel emotions.

**Get the Leading Edge - Motivate Yourself to Take Control at Work**

What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires and motivates others to achieve a common goal. It's not about being tall or intelligent. A good leader should be able to communicate their ideas clearly and confidently.

According to Pat Dixon, a leadership expert, enthusiasm is key. A leader should be able to inspire others and make them feel excited about the work they do.

John van Maurik, a leadership course director, believes that most people have the potential to be leaders. The key is to recognize and develop their skills.

In the workplace, a good leader motivates and supports their team. They set clear goals and achieve them in a way that makes everyone feel valued and involved.

Managers and leaders are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path.

Whether you're a boss or a team member, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. Here are some tips:

* Find your passions and convictions and use them to lead.
* Recognize your leadership abilities and use them to make a difference.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from your mistakes.
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but don't try to lead all the time.

Remember, leadership is not just about giving orders, it's about inspiring and motivating others to achieve a common goal.<|eot_id|>"

**Film Reviews**

**Abyss**

This 1989 film by James Cameron is a thrilling Cold War movie about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a submarine. The characters are memorable, especially the brave and funny foreman Bud. The special effects and production design are impressive, but the dialogue and character development could be better. The story is a bit predictable, but the film is still enjoyable.

**The Thin Red Line**

This 1964 film, directed by Andrew Marton, is an adaptation of James Jones' novel about the battle for Guadalcanal. It's a more traditional war movie compared to Terrence Malick's version. The film focuses on a single soldier and his sergeant, and it's often more faithful to the book. While Malick's film is more complex and poetic, Marton's version has its own strengths, such as a powerful flashback sequence.

**On Guard**

This 1999 film is a swashbuckling adventure loosely based on a 19th-century novel. It's a fun and entertaining movie with a great villain and some impressive sword fights. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and the actors have a good time playing their roles.

**Character**

This 1997 Dutch film is a period drama about a brutal bailiff and his son in 19th-century Rotterdam. The film is visually impressive, with detailed costumes and settings. However, the story is a bit slow and the characters could be more developed.

**The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**

This classic 1966 Western has been digitally remastered for video release. The sound quality is excellent, and the music is iconic. The story is a classic tale of good and evil, but the characters are all a bit morally ambiguous.

**The Longest Day**

This 1962 war epic, directed by four different directors, is a big-budget production with many famous stars. While it's an impressive feat, the film is a bit too long and slow-paced for some viewers. The video release is a bit disappointing, as it was meant to be seen on the big screen.

I used to have a good job, but I realized that I was sacrificing my own happiness for the sake of my career. Now I'm free to do what I want, and I'm excited to explore the world. My friends are all settled down with families, but they're a bit jealous of my freedom.

I'm worried about making the necessary arrangements, like renting out my flat and organizing my finances. I'm also concerned about leaving my old life behind and adjusting to a new way of living. Will I be able to handle the basics, like finding food and shelter? Will I feel out of place among younger travelers?

Many people in their 30s are taking a break from their daily routine to travel and explore. They're realizing that life is too short to spend it all in one place. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet, says that people are becoming more aware that they can have the adventure they've always wanted, if they're brave enough and organized enough.

I looked at my CV and saw that I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the norm. I didn't have any experience with computers, and most job ads asked for experience with desktop publishing. I thought it was unlikely that I would get a job in a newsroom without knowing how to use a computer.

I was the family's technology expert, but even I didn't know how to use a pocket calculator or the timer on the video. I knew I had to learn quickly. I entered a competition and won a computer package, which included a laptop and a personal computer for my family. We started using the internet and learned new terms like ""cyberspace"" and ""surfing"". We even started chatting with strangers online.

I set up a mini-office in the kitchen and started working from home. I was hesitant at first, but I managed to learn the basics. I began freelancing for a magazine and was able to contribute two articles a month. I was happy to have the best of both worlds.

The computer has helped me stay organized and efficient. I can keep track of my income and expenses using spreadsheets, and I can send invoices and letters quickly. I can also research stories and ask for information online. However, working from home can be isolating, and there are distractions like household chores and power struggles over the computer.

The National Museum of Scotland is a modern building with a unique design. The exterior is striking, with a large tower and a garden on top. The museum's contents are also impressive. The exhibitions are designed to be easy to follow, with a timeline to help visitors understand the different eras. The museum shows many precious historical objects, including Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the silver from the Holyrood chapel. The goal is to make the museum enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just experts.

The head of exhibitions, Dr. David Clarke, wants visitors to have a pleasurable experience. He believes that the museum should not try to recreate the past, but rather show the truth. The result is that the museum displays the objects exactly as they are, with explanations and captions to help visitors understand their significance.

The museum has a Discovery Centre for children, where they can learn through hands-on activities. The museum also has a temporary exhibition on the top floor, which changes every three years. The current exhibition features objects that have had a big impact on Scottish life in the 20th century. The Prime Minister even suggested an electric guitar!

Overall, the museum's modern design works well from the inside and the top, but some people are not sure if it's the right location. The museum's focus on showing the truth and using historical objects to tell stories is likely to make it a popular destination.

Newspapers are slowly moving from print to online. However, this process is not as easy as it seems. While many people visit newspaper websites, the number of people buying print newspapers is decreasing. But, surprisingly, some newspapers are still doing well. For example, in some countries, like Asia, the number of people reading newspapers is increasing.

Some experts say that newspapers are dying because of the internet. But, actually, many people still read newspapers in print. In fact, some people read both print and online versions of the same newspaper. Newspapers are important because they help sell internet subscriptions. Print advertising is also much more profitable than online advertising.

Newspapers are trying to find a way to make money online. Some have built walls around their websites to charge readers for access. However, this is not easy. Newspapers need to maintain both their print and online versions, which is expensive and complicated.

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. They can make a photo more engaging than a scene without people. However, photographing people can be challenging. You need to consider not only the technical and artistic aspects but also the actions, gestures, and expressions of your subjects.

**GROUP SHOTS**

When taking a group photo, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sitting or kneeling in front to make it easier to see everyone's faces.

**POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often stiffen up when they know they're being photographed. To relax them, suggest they find a comfortable position. You can also ask them to fold their arms or put their hands in their pockets.

**THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can create tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to be photographed and are often flattered by it. However, they may become self-conscious, so you may need to direct them.

**EYE CONTACT**

A photo gains impact when the subject looks directly at the camera. Ask your subject to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. You can remind them just before taking the photo.

**CANDID CONCENTRATION**

An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can be easier for them and make the viewer feel like they're observing the subject unnoticed.

**EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures can tell us more about a person than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiles, winks, anger, or tears.

**SITUATION INTEREST**

The background or environment can add interest and information to a photo. Try to exclude irrelevant details and focus on the subject.

**INTERACTION**

Photos of people interacting with each other can be great. Look for eye contact, physical contact, or reactions to each other.

**PEOPLE AND PLACES**

When taking photos of people in a new place, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to include the background. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so that they form a foreground interest without obscuring the background.

**TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want to take the photo. If it's to remember someone, you may want a posed photo. But for family photos, candid shots of events as they happen are often more lively and memorable.

She discovered trompe-l'oeil by chance and was immediately drawn to it. She loves the challenge of creating a realistic painting that looks like it's part of the real world.

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil is not something you can learn in school. It's about observing the world and paying attention to details. She is still learning and is always looking for new ways to improve her skills.

Sarah is known for her attention to detail and her ability to create realistic paintings. She has worked on many big projects, including a ceiling in a castle. She is humble about her talents and doesn't like to talk about her successes.

Sarah's work is unique and has been praised by her clients. She loves working with clients and getting to know them. She believes that the best trompe-l'oeil paintings are those that are personal to the client and make them feel like they are part of the art.

Overall, Sarah Janson is a talented artist who is passionate about her work. She is humble and doesn't like to brag, but her work speaks for itself.<|eot_id|>"

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**

The way we work is changing. We're no longer just judged on how smart we are or how well we do our job. Now, we're also judged on how well we get along with others and how well we handle ourselves. This is becoming more important when it comes to getting hired, getting promoted, or even just doing our job well.

In the past, we were taught that being good at school was the most important thing. But now, it's not enough. Employers want people who can work well with others, who are adaptable, persuasive, and can handle their emotions and the emotions of those around them. These are the ""people skills"" that make up what's called emotional intelligence.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own emotions and the emotions of others. It's about being aware of how we feel and how others feel, and using that to make good decisions. It's not just about being nice, but about being able to handle difficult situations and make tough choices.

More and more companies are recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence in the workplace. They're realizing that it's not just about technical skills, but about how well we work with others. In fact, research shows that people can improve their emotional intelligence over time, and that it's an important part of growing and developing as a person.

Emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success, but it's an important part of being successful in our personal and professional lives. By developing these skills, we can become better employees, better friends, and better people.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B2 learner:

""The media is discussing whether they should use content created by others without asking permission. With smartphones, it's easy to take pictures and videos of news events, and social media has changed the way we share them. Journalists are now using social media to get images quickly. However, some journalists have used photos and videos without asking the person who took them. There's a debate about whether this is right. Some people think it's okay to use these images if they're in the public interest, but others disagree.

Research shows that many people would take pictures or videos of news events, so user-generated content (UGC) will play a big role in the future of the media. But to keep a good relationship with the public, the media needs to make sure that people are properly paid for their work and always ask for permission to use their content.""

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced the use of complex vocabulary (e.g. ""revolutionised"", ""exceptional circumstances"", ""souring"")

**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese treatment that is over 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbalism, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but its role in treating pain has received the most attention from Western doctors. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**How it Works**

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is a state where the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are in harmony. According to this theory, energy flows around the body along special lines called meridians. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes out of balance, which can lead to weakness or illness. During a consultation, an acupuncturist will try to find where the energy is imbalanced. This is done by feeling the pulse on the wrist, examining the tongue, and assessing the person's overall appearance. The acupuncturist will also ask about the person's medical history, current health, and lifestyle.

**The Treatment**

An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin to stimulate the flow of energy. They may also apply warmth from smoldering herbs or pressure at specific points on the meridians. The person may feel a gentle, pleasant sensation when the needle is manipulated. There are over 300 points on the main meridians, with many more used less frequently.

**How it Works According to Science**

While Western doctors do not accept the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, they have found that acupuncture can be effective for pain relief. Scientists have suggested that stimulating specific nerves can block pain signals and stop them from reaching the brain. Others believe that stimulating acupuncture points releases natural pain-relieving substances.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Many people with chronic pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. Commonly treated conditions include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and post-operative pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

**Modern Use**

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery is a more recent development. This has helped convince some doctors outside of China that there is more to acupuncture than just mind over matter. In China, acupuncture is now used during various operations, including tonsillectomies and caesareans, and even during open heart surgery.

**Effectiveness**

Clinical trials have shown that 50-80% of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally quote a similar success rate. They accept that it may not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists say that it usually takes between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief, but some improvement should be felt after just two or three visits.

**A Different Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists view their patients holistically, taking into account not just specific symptoms but also underlying weaknesses in the energy flow and external factors that may be causing the pain. This approach is different from the way Western doctors typically view pain.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others reject traditional Chinese theory and subscribe to scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by applying traditional Chinese medicine can deep changes be brought about that lead to a longer cure. It is important to choose an acupuncturist who refers you to a medical doctor if necessary.<|eot_id|>"

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. She is known for her clever and complex stories. At first glance, she seems like a serious and authoritative person, but she is actually shy. She says that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is like her, but if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes on his own, just like his creator. James needs time to herself when she writes, and she can write anywhere as long as she has privacy.

James is humble and doesn't like to talk about being Britain's best-known crime writer. She has written 12 major detective novels, and millions of people around the world read them. She is a fan of her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine. James likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also enjoys books by male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

James didn't become a successful writer until later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, a student at the university. James had to work long hours to support her family, including her two young daughters, after her husband returned from World War II with health problems. Her in-laws helped take care of the girls during those difficult years.

James worked full-time in administration for the National Health Service while writing in her spare time. She used her organizational skills to manage five psychiatric outpatients' clinics and later worked in the Police Department and the Home Office. She became familiar with forensic science, but it wasn't the sight of corpses that inspired her to write. Instead, she was drawn to the structure and construction of a crime novel. She wanted to write a serious novel about human beings, and detective stories allowed her to do that. James says that writing detective stories is a way of bringing order to chaos and confirming the value of life, even if that life is imperfect.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B2 level learner:

The study of handwriting, also known as graphology, is becoming more popular. In some countries, employers ask for a sample of a job applicant's handwriting to help decide if they are suitable for the job. Graphology is considered a science in many countries, and researchers believe it can be useful in detecting certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and revealing a person's psychological state. Many big companies now use graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential employees. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the value of graphology.

Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist, believes that handwriting can reveal a person's character, including their social class, intelligence, and mental ability. She says that graphology can be useful in assessing whether someone is honest, manipulative, or reliable. Marne also claims that graphology can predict criminal tendencies, identify people who are likely to commit suicide, and even detect heart and lung problems.

Marne says that it takes six years of study and experience to become a skilled graphologist. She believes that more research is needed to make graphology a more scientifically accepted field. However, some psychiatrists are critical of graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught, and has no other significance.

A new survey says that fresh air and comfortable chairs are important for a happy and healthy workforce. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as working environments. Our experts were a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist.

Office A: Advertising Agency

* The office is simple, with no central heating or ventilation. But the employees, who are part of a small team, seem happy. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and windows or using electric radiators.
* The furniture is not ideal, but the employees have a varied schedule, which helps reduce fatigue and boredom.

Office B: News Service

* The office is comfortable and well-maintained. The air quality is good, and there is a no-smoking policy.
* The chairs are good, but the space is impersonal and unstimulating. The employees are satisfied, but the office could be improved with more decorations and ways to share information.

Office C: Bank

* This office is standard and uninspiring. The air is clean, but the desks and chairs are not ideal.
* The employees are supportive and well-equipped with technology. The office is busy and has a positive atmosphere.

Office D: Newspaper

* This office has many problems. The air-conditioning is poor, and the space is cluttered and dusty. The furniture is old and uncomfortable.
* The employees are stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to improve the air quality, tidy up the office, and recognize individual successes.

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Chewing gum is a popular habit that's been around for thousands of years. In ancient Greece, people chewed a resin from the mastic tree to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Later, American colonists followed the example of Native Americans and chewed resin from spruce trees.

In the 1860s, a new type of chewing gum was invented using a milky substance called chicle, which comes from a tree in the Central American rainforest. This gum was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, and it became a big business.

However, the people who collect chicle, called chicleros, have a difficult and dangerous job. They have to trek through the rainforest, avoiding snakes and insects, to tap the trees and collect the sap. The conditions are harsh, with high humidity and limited food.

Today, most chewing gum is made synthetically, with added ingredients like pine resin and softeners. The manufacturers claim that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay by increasing saliva production. Research is ongoing to develop new textures and flavors, with many new flavors using artificial ingredients.

Interestingly, the United States imports very little chicle from Central America these days, as most manufacturers have switched to synthetic ingredients. The world's gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products, with claims that gum can help with stress, energy, and oral health.

The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown is a professional who judges hotels. She visited the Globe Hotel to check its quality. From the moment she arrived, things went wrong. The receptionist was slow to help a guest and didn't even acknowledge Sue and her companion. This is a common mistake, but Sue was surprised because the Globe is a three-star hotel and she expected better service.

As she walked in, Sue noticed that the entrance was not well-designed. There was no one to greet her, and the long, empty corridor leading to the hotel entrance was not welcoming. When she arrived at the reception, the receptionist told her that they didn't have a record of her booking. It turned out that many of the hotel's rooms were empty that night.

Sue was not impressed with her room on the top floor. It was stuffy, and there was a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. She has been a hotel inspector for 11 years and has seen many problems like this before.

The next morning, Sue met the hotel's general manager, Robin Greaves. She told him about all the mistakes she had seen, including the poor service and the unpleasant smell in the main lounge. Greaves apologized and promised to fix the problems.

Despite the issues, Sue found some things to praise, such as the helpful assistant manager and the waitress who knew a lot about the hotel's history. The food was also good, which is why the hotel has a two-rosette rating. Sue gave Greaves some advice on how to improve the hotel and get a three-rosette rating, including serving better desserts.

As a hotel inspector, Sue has to be honest and tell the truth, even if it's difficult. She has to write a report about her visit and give feedback to the hotel. The hotel pays for this service, but it's worth it because it helps them improve and become better hotels.<|eot_id|>"

Conquering the Seven Summits: My Journey to the Top of the World

I, Doug Scott, am a mountaineer who has climbed the highest peaks on each continent. I'll tell you about my experiences on each of these incredible journeys.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

I climbed Mt. Everest with my partner, Dougal Haston. We were in a snow cave when Dougal started talking to our equipment officer, Dave Clark, about sleeping bags. I thought it was strange, as we were the only two people there. I realized that the high altitude was affecting me, and I started talking to my feet! We had to be careful not to get frostbite. On the summit ridge, I felt a sense of calm and confidence with Dougal by my side.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

Mt. McKinley is considered the most challenging mountain in the world. Dougal and I took four days to reach the base camp. We decided to climb ""alpine style,"" carrying our equipment and food with us. The air pressure at high altitude made us feel like we were at 7,000m, even though we were only at 6,100m. We finally reached the summit, exhausted.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)

I climbed Kilimanjaro with Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the jungle and had to find a rock pool with water. We decided to take a different route to the summit, as the original one was too treacherous. We were relieved to find a trail of rubbish, which led us to the top.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu. We joined a group led by guide Phil Erscheler, who took us via the Polish Glacier. We had to wait out bad weather for three days before starting our ascent. The glacier was icy and windy, but we reached the summit.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

I climbed Vinson Massif with a team of guides. We traveled to the South Pole and then to the mountain. The air was crisp and clean, and the silence was surreal. We reached the summit in just eight hours, despite strong winds and temperatures below -50°C.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

I climbed Elbrus with a team. We had to pay a commission to our guide to bring us into the valley. We acclimatized for a few days before starting our ascent. The wind was strong, but we reached the summit.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

I climbed Carstensz with a team. We hoped to establish a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. We were warned about bandits, but we continued anyway. We reached the summit and were given a standing ovation.

I'm proud to have completed the Seven Summits challenge.<|eot_id|>"

Susan Shepherd is a well-known artist who paints flowers. Her garden, which is full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, is her main source of inspiration. The garden has a beautiful harmony of colors, shapes, and structures, thanks to the previous owners who were passionate about gardening. Susan also inherited a gardener named Danny, who helped her with her garden.

Susan likes to focus on individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She takes the flowers from her garden to her studio, paints them, and then adds more flowers to the painting over time. It can take her a few days or even years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is in the spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom.

Susan is fascinated by the way flowers change and develop over time. She loves how tulips, for example, change shape and form when they are put in a vase. She has always been interested in plants and used to collect wild flowers as a child. Now, she has a garden with plants from all around the world, but she still likes to keep things simple and relaxed.

With two upcoming exhibitions, Susan has been busy preparing for them. She has an extra gardener to help her with the garden, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, she needs to get her hands dirty and work in the garden herself.

Many trees in the town of Brackham were knocked down during a severe storm in March. The storm damaged the town's appearance, especially the market square. The disappearance of the big lime trees was a big change for the town. The local police chief, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, was not happy about it. However, he was too sick to notice at the time. He had been taken ill with bronchitis and was not well enough to go to work.

Pelham's wife, Molly, tried to convince him to see a doctor, but he refused. He didn't want to leave his work, so he tried to keep working despite his illness. This made him feel worse and his temper got shorter. It wasn't until his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to get help.

When Pelham recovered, he was surprised to see that his walnut tree had been knocked down. He had been too sick to notice earlier. His wife told him that the tree had been taken down during the night. Pelham was not happy about it and asked his wife about the damage to their house. He was relieved to hear that there was none.

It wasn't until a few days later, when he felt better, that Pelham realized how much the loss of the walnut tree had changed the look of his living room. The tree had provided shade and made the room look cozier. Without it, the room seemed too bright and the worn furniture was exposed. The view from the window was also unpleasant, as the house next door was now visible, with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes.

Pelham was unhappy with the new view and told his wife so. However, Molly had been saying the same thing for a while, and she thought they needed to buy a new sofa to improve the room.<|eot_id|>"

We had lived in our valley for 16 months before we realized the dangers that could threaten our survival. It was a year when the storms came early, even before winter had officially started. We had always felt safe and sheltered in our valley, protected by the hills. But then the snow started falling. Within a day, it was 15 centimeters deep and blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. The snow was much deeper on the hills, and the wind was strong. We felt the wind's effects, but we knew we had to be careful. The river, the Ryburn, was our main concern. It normally flowed gently, but we knew that if the dams hadn't been built to control its flow many years ago, it could have caused problems. As the snow started to melt, we watched the clouds gathering over the hills. They looked ominous and warned us of what was to come. We began to watch the river closely, as it grew fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away by the rain, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing. And then it happened - the reservoir overflowed for the first time in years. The water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river became furious, and the stream near our cottage was deeper than we had ever seen it. For three days, we prayed that it would stay below its banks. Luckily, the dam held, and the water began to recede. In the past, the river had flooded nearby villages in a similar way. But now, with the dam, we can enjoy the big clouds and the river's power without fear. We feel safe in our valley, thanks to the dam.<|eot_id|>"

I met Tom Seaton, the arts editor, who had also worked in radio and TV. He hired me, but he wasn't a traditional journalist. He wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would discuss our choices over lunch, with guests to make it a social event. It was a dream come true to be part of a new newspaper. I was worried that the paper wouldn't succeed in a crowded market, but Tom believed in me.

The original plan didn't work out, and we ended up doing everything by phone. The public preferred to associate a reviewer with a specific area, so I focused on film. Without Tom's support, I wouldn't be doing what I do today. I'm grateful for the freedom to write longer pieces on one film each week. I wouldn't want to review every film that comes out; it would get boring. Instead, I can explore my ideas and make the most of my writing space. But what's my role in the public arena? People usually choose which films to see based on the stars, publicity, or director. It's rare for someone to change their mind about a film after reading a review. So, if a film review isn't a guide for what to watch, what is it? I don't feel responsible for being 'right' about a movie. I just need to present my argument. I'm not a judge, and I wouldn't want to be.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary
* Removed complex metaphors and idioms (e.g. ""a bit of a dream"", ""sinking into my seat with a sigh"")
* Clarified the main points and ideas
* Removed some of the more abstract concepts (e.g. the idea that a reviewer shouldn't be a ""judge"")
* Changed some of the more formal language to make it more conversational

Here is a simplified version of the passage for a B2 learner:

Melanie is a 17-year-old schoolgirl who loves triathlons. She swims 1500 meters, cycles 40 kilometers, and then runs 10 kilometers without stopping. She is very good at it and has even won some competitions. But what makes her do this? She says it's because it's fun.

Melanie started doing triathlons when she was 14. She won her first competition, but then she realized it was harder than she thought. She finished a triathlon once, but she went the wrong way and had to cycle 20 kilometers extra. She was very disappointed, but she didn't give up.

Now, Melanie is training hard to get better. She wants to be a professional triathlete and compete in the Olympics. She has to work hard because she is not as good at cycling as she is at swimming and running. She is trying to persuade her parents to buy her a new bike that costs £2,000. She has already spent £1,300 on her training.

Melanie's training is very intense. She has to swim, cycle, and run for hours every day. She doesn't have much time for social activities or friends. She only talks to her teammates about their training and how they are doing.

Melanie wants to do even harder events than triathlons. She has tried the ""sprint"" triathlon, which is shorter, but she wants to do longer and more challenging events. The problem is that she doesn't have anyone her age to train with.

Note: I made some minor changes to the text to make it more accessible to a B2 learner, including:

Here is the simplified text, making it suitable for a B2 learner:

Collecting is a popular hobby that many people enjoy. I have always loved collecting and I'm not alone - one in three adults collects something. Collecting is a world of passion, excitement, and joy. But remember, if you don't fall in love with an object, don't collect it.

People have been collecting things for thousands of years. In the past, people collected pebbles, stones, and seashells because of their beauty. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for the same reason. I have been collecting things my whole life, from flowers to pottery and paintings. My first collection was of stones I found in my parents' garden.

I was fascinated by the objects at the local museum when I was a child. I was lucky to have a school in a remote part of England, surrounded by hills. My parents would take me to the museum when they visited, and I would spend hours looking at the objects on display.

Many people collect things for different reasons. Some people collect because it's the only part of their life where they have complete control. For me, collecting is just something I enjoy doing.

There are many famous collectors throughout history. One example is the Duc de Berry in France, who had a room full of strange and interesting objects. Another example is Catherine the Great of Russia, who collected over 4,000 paintings.

You don't have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I have collected all sorts of things, from tulip bulbs to china cups. I've even collected American rag dolls - 350 of them! Unfortunately, my collection was destroyed in a fire.

What I find interesting is how collections change hands and how certain objects become valuable. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a famous poet can be very valuable. As certain objects become popular, their price goes up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now valuable if you still have the original boxes and contents.

I hope you enjoy collecting, but remember, it's not just about accumulating things - it's about loving and appreciating the objects you collect.<|eot_id|>"

We always went to Ireland in June. We had been going to Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim for years. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The owners, the Malseeds, have made some changes, but it's still the same place we love. Our friend Strafe found the house for us. He saw an advertisement and thought it would be perfect for us. We had been to a hotel the year before, but it wasn't great because the food was bad. We've been friends for a long time - Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me, Milly. We've known each other since we were kids.

We always stay in the same rooms, which are named after flowers. Mrs Malseed painted the names on the doors. She's very welcoming and always knows when we're arriving. Her husband, Mr Malseed, is friendly and helpful too. He's always making sure everything is in order. When we arrived, everyone was smiling and chatting. We felt like we were really on holiday.

After dinner, we played cards for a bit, but we were all still a bit tired from our journey. There were other people staying at the lodge, including a man on his own and a French couple. We could see some of them walking around the gardens or going down to the beach. In the morning, we would walk to Ardbeag, have coffee, and then come back for lunch. In the afternoon, we would go out and explore. We love this routine and have done it for years. We've fallen in love with the beautiful landscape of Ireland.<|eot_id|>"

Rita Cohen, a young woman who looked much younger than she claimed to be, came to Seymour's factory one day. She was dressed in overalls and had a messy, curly hairdo. Despite her small size, she was a student at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. Seymour was surprised to learn that she was interested in every detail of the process. He agreed to show her around the factory and explain how they made gloves.

As they walked through the factory, Rita asked questions about the process, taking notes. Seymour was impressed by her curiosity and enthusiasm. He offered to take her on a tour of the tannery, where the raw material was processed. Rita had never been inside a tannery before, and Seymour explained that it was an important part of the leather-making process.

Rita was fascinated by the history of the industry and mentioned that her father was a leather expert. Seymour laughed and said that his own daughter, Marie, was also interested in the trade. He noticed that Rita had a similar spirit and enthusiasm to Marie, and the two of them started to chat like old friends.

Seymour offered to make a pair of gloves for Rita to see the process from start to finish. He asked her what size she wore, and they began the tour.<|eot_id|>"

In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old brick building with a roof. The yard was covered in sawdust, and the smell of wood filled the air. One afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored and decided to climb up to the roof. They sat down and looked out at the lake. Michael suddenly said, 'I dare you to jump down!' He jumped first, laughing and rolling around in the sawdust. The others followed, laughing and feeling relieved when they landed safely.

After a while, they all lay down in the sawdust, telling jokes and having fun. Later, one of Michael's friends suggested they go up to the roof again and jump down. This time, they were all a bit more hesitant, but they went ahead and jumped. Michael was the last one left on the roof, and his friends were calling out to him to join them. But Michael was scared and couldn't bring himself to jump.

He stayed on the roof for a long time, feeling embarrassed and ashamed. His friends eventually got tired of waiting and started to leave. Michael was left alone, staring at the ground. He finally closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and jumped down. He lay in the sawdust for a long time, feeling miserable.

As the sun began to set, Michael slowly got up and walked home. He was late for dinner and his stepmother was angry with him.

Are you unhappy in your job, but unsure how to change? Career advice can be a great help. Many people turn to career advisors to find a new career path. They will ask you to write a short autobiography and take a series of tests called ""psychometrics"". The results will give you an idea of what careers might be suitable for you and what training you may need.

I decided to try out Career Analysts, one of the largest career advice organizations. The test was similar to a science exam, where I had to answer questions quickly and accurately. The test was not about passing or failing, but about getting an accurate picture of me.

After the test, I had a long conversation with an advisor. They used the results of the test and our conversation to create a report with their observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the suggestions, but was surprised to find that I did not do well in the scientific and practical tests. However, I was relieved to be told that I made the right decision in choosing journalism.

You don't have to make a huge change to rethink your career. Donna Laney, for example, was a marketing manager for five years before losing her job. She went to Career Analysts and discovered she had a talent for design. However, she had to weigh the cost of retraining against her financial commitments. In the end, she decided to use her existing skills and move into a more suitable field.

Career advice can be helpful, but it's not always a guarantee of success. Juliet Greene, for example, went to Career Counselling Services and decided to pursue a degree in geology. She was happy with the advice she received and felt it was worth the cost. However, Amanda Margetts, a sales representative, felt that the advice she received was not particularly helpful. She was not surprised by the suggestions and felt that a friend could have given her similar advice.

'Fun at the Dentist's? Dr. W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in Glasgow's city centre is a pleasant surprise. The walls are decorated with modern paintings, and patients sit on a stylish blue couch while he examines their teeth. Jerome says that many people only visit the dentist when they're in pain, because they're afraid. To make them feel more at ease, he's created a relaxed atmosphere. He doesn't wear a white coat, which can make people anxious. Instead, he wants his patients to feel relaxed, interested, and even enjoy their visit.

To achieve this, Jerome has introduced some innovative techniques. For example, he uses virtual-reality headsets to distract patients during their check-ups. They watch a film about underwater wildlife while he examines their teeth. This makes the experience more enjoyable and helps patients forget any previous negative experiences.

The surgery also has a pleasant smell, similar to a perfume shop. Jerome wants his patients to feel comfortable and relaxed from the moment they walk in. He's very serious about his work, but he also believes that making patients feel at ease is crucial. He uses special instruments to clean teeth, which are gentle and painless.

Jerome has also learned from his research in the United States that treating patients with respect and care makes his job easier too. He's trying to change the way dentistry is done in Britain, making it more patient-centred and less formal. When patients arrive, he offers them a cup of tea and asks what video they'd like to watch. The surgery feels like a luxurious beauty parlour, not a typical dental practice.'

Chocolate has a long history that dates back to ancient times. It originated in South America, where the Aztecs and Mayans grew a special tree called the cacao tree. The tree produces a fruit with 20-40 seeds, which are used to make chocolate. The Aztecs used these seeds as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water'. This drink was flavoured with spices and was only for special occasions.

The Spanish conquistadors brought chocolate to Europe, where it became popular in the 17th century. At first, it was very expensive and only the rich could afford it. Later, in the 18th century, chocolate houses were set up in big cities, where people could go to drink chocolate.

In the 19th century, a Dutch inventor called CJ van Houten developed a way to make chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate at home. Then, a British company called Fry and Sons created the first chocolate bar in 1847. They mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate and sugar to make a solid bar.

In the 20th century, a Swiss company added milk to the chocolate-making process, creating milk chocolate. Today, chocolate is a popular treat around the world, with people in the UK spending over £230 million on it every Easter. However, some cacao farmers are struggling due to a decline in cocoa bean prices. Many small-scale farmers were forced out of business in the 1980s. As you enjoy your next chocolate bar, remember the people who work hard to produce the chocolate.

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends most of her time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research on marine geochemistry at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater adventures in a special vehicle that's like a small car. She dives down to three kilometers below the surface to study underwater volcanoes.

The space inside the vehicle is very small, so she can reach out and touch the two pilots who are with her. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. The dive can take up to 16 hours - three hours to get down, ten hours to collect samples, and three hours to get back up.

If anything goes wrong, Rachel can press a panic button to get out quickly. The outside door opens, and a small escape vessel rises to the surface. Rachel has made six dives so far, including one with a Russian team. They went to a site in the Atlantic Ocean where there are many underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes have chimneys that release black smoke.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves. She teaches so she can focus on her research on underwater volcanoes, also known as ""black smokers."" These volcanoes release hot water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

But the next year, and the year after, I did it all again. The Inter-Rail ticket was amazing - it allowed me to travel anywhere in Europe for a month without spending a lot of money. Once you get used to sleeping on trains and carrying all your belongings in a backpack, you start to see the world in a different way. You learn to be more flexible and to let go of unnecessary things, like old socks and books. The Inter-Rail system is great because it lets young people travel quickly and easily from one country to another. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't realize how much we could travel until we discovered the freedom of non-stop travel. We would visit one country, and then another, and another, without worrying about the cost. We weren't really interested in culture, but we loved the feeling of independence and the chance to do things our own way. We were proud of the fact that we could be happy just sitting on a train platform, watching the view. When we arrived in a new place, it was like discovering it for the first time. Seeing Europe with your own eyes is the best way to understand it. Everyone knows what Europe is like, but until you experience it yourself, it's just a collection of facts.

Losing your luggage at an airport can be very frustrating. Imagine having to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline finds your luggage. This can happen when you travel to a different climate zone or country and have to wear clothes that are not suitable for the weather. Airlines rarely reveal how many bags they lose, but it's a common problem for frequent travelers. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it's impossible to guarantee that your luggage will arrive at the same time as you do. The problem lies in the baggage system. Airlines require passengers to check in early to allow time for luggage to be loaded onto the plane. They also have minimum connecting times, which are longer than necessary, to allow for baggage transfers. However, delays and security checks can cause problems, and human error or accidents can also lead to lost luggage. Large airports, known as hubs, are particularly prone to issues because they handle a huge number of bags. Even efficient airports can have bad days. Certain airports, such as Miami, have a higher risk of lost luggage. To minimize the risk, try to book direct flights and check in early. If you have a connecting flight, try to fly with the same airline and allow extra time for your transfer. Make sure to label your luggage clearly with your home and holiday addresses, as well as the flight numbers. If your luggage is still lost, report it to the airline official in the baggage hall before leaving the airport.

Charlie fell in love with kingfishers when he was young and can't quite explain why. Some people believe that kingfishers have a special connection to the moon and the sun, which is partly true. The structure of their feathers actually scatters light and reflects blue, making them appear to change color depending on the angle of the light.

Kingfishers are shy birds, but they can be easy to spot from a hideout. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket, and he was thrilled when a kingfisher came to sit just a meter away. However, it took him four years to get a good picture. He spent so much time with the birds that he missed school and became an ""academic failure."" But his passion for kingfishers paid off, and he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine at the age of 16. He now works as a freelance wildlife film cameraman and hopes to make the ultimate kingfisher film. His goal is to create a film with no narration, just beautiful images that speak for themselves.

Charlie's relationship with kingfishers goes beyond his work. He loves the simple, natural beauty of the birds and the emotions they evoke. His photographs capture some of this feeling, but there's still more to his connection with the kingfishers than his work can show.<|eot_id|>"

Becoming a conductor is a challenging job. Five conductors share their experiences with Anne Inglis. 

A. ANNE MANSON Anne Manson, 30, started by helping a famous conductor, Claudio Abbado, in Vienna. She was asked to take charge of a rehearsal and then helped with another opera. Manson works with a London-based opera company that focuses on modern music. She has also worked in other European countries with the help of the British Arts Council.

B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE Andrew Constantine, 31, won a major competition in 1991 after trying out for two other competitions. He says the hardest part is getting people to notice him. He is grateful for the competition, which gave him many performance opportunities and a chance to work with a well-known conductor. However, he worries that his name will still be associated with the competition in three years.

C. WASFI KANI Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice period that comes with opera productions. She started conducting in her late 20s and learned from Sian Edwards. Kani enjoys the complexity of opera, which involves working with singers and dealing with their personalities.

D. ROGER VIGNOLES Roger Vignoles, 48, didn't plan to become a conductor. He started as a musician at an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed a Handel opera from the piano for the first time. He found it easier than expected and is grateful for his musical experience.

E. WAYNE MARSHALL Wayne Marshall, 32, started conducting by helping a famous conductor, Simon Rattle. He soon found himself conducting a musical in London, which was a difficult experience. He had to deal with some professional musicians who were not paying attention during the show. Marshall believes in being clear and direct with the musicians and is determined to succeed.

**Choosing the Best Theme Park for Your Family**

If you're thinking of taking your kids to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to test the best ones. Here's what they thought:

**Fun Island**

The Burns family visited Fun Island and were impressed. The park is great for younger kids, with rides like the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special dodgems ride for the little ones. Older kids will enjoy scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! The staff are very helpful and the park is clean and well-organized.

**Wonderland**

The McMillan family had never been to a theme park before, but they loved it. The park has something for everyone, including a Mountain Train and a ferris wheel. The staff are friendly and the landscaping is perfect.

**Adventure World**

The Jeffree family spent seven hours at Adventure World and still didn't see everything. They loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line, which was a bit scary but fun. There's also a great ride called Running River that's perfect for younger kids.

**The Great Park**

The Langridge family visited The Great Park and thought it was great for younger kids. The rides aren't too scary, and they enjoyed Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then gets exciting. The staff are great and the park is clean.

**Fantasy World**

The Break-all family visited Fantasy World and thought it was a lot of fun. They loved the Rocket, Europe's tallest roller-coaster, and the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres above the ground. The park has a dozen main rides, and the staff are generally helpful, although some were more friendly than others.

**Running a business in the countryside**

Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside.

A. ""My customers are like friends,"" says Christine Hogan, who runs a computer-aided design business. She moved to the countryside with her husband and children, and started her business because she wanted to work from home. It was challenging at first, but she was careful with her finances and was able to keep her business small. Most of her customers come to collect their work from her, so she doesn't have to deliver much.

B. ""I love being independent,"" says Maggy Sasanow, who designs greetings cards from her home. She used to work in art, but moved to the countryside after she got married. She started her business because there wasn't much work in her field in the area. She sells her cards to museums and works mostly by word of mouth. She sometimes misses the social aspect of working with others, but overall, she enjoys her independence.

C. ""It's been tough at times,"" says Delia Turner, who runs a curtain-making business. She started her business eight years ago and it grew quickly, but then the economy declined and she had to lay off her employees. She now works with her husband and a few freelancers from home. She has to be flexible and adapt to changes in the market.

D. Tessa Strickland runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside for financial reasons and to be closer to nature. She enjoys the flexibility of working from home, but sometimes has to work at odd hours to deal with clients in different time zones. She publishes books from around the world and works with authors and artists.

E. Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop, employing six people. She started her business ten years ago, making fruit cakes at home and sending them to friends and family. As the business grew, she rented a small building and hired staff. Her biggest challenge has been managing the financial side of the business, as she didn't have a lot of start-up capital.

Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The Watkins family is very talented when it comes to music. John and Hetty Watkins are schoolteachers from South Wales. Their son Paul is a composer and a prize-winning musician. And guess what? John makes the instruments himself! When Paul was 10, he wanted a cello to play, but it was too expensive. So, John decided to learn how to make one. He went to a school for instrument making and learned how to make cellos. He even made one for Paul, which Paul used for many years.

John and Hetty encouraged both Paul and his younger brother Huw to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano, but soon switched to the cello. Huw started with the piano too, but then decided to play the violin. However, he didn't like it and instead started playing the piano again. John and Hetty were very supportive of their sons' musical interests.

Paul became very good at the cello and even won a competition. He then became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. But recently, he got a new cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. John is proud of his son's talent, but he admits that his new cello is better than the one he made.

Huw is also a talented musician. He is a pianist and composer and is going to perform his string quartet at the Wigmore Hall. The family is very busy with their musical activities, and John and Hetty have to be very organized to keep track of everything.

The National Trust is an organization that works to protect the British countryside. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and met Gareth Roberts, a warden who takes care of the beautiful areas owned by the Trust.

To be a National Trust Warden, you need to have common sense and be good at dealing with people. Gareth was born and grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm before becoming a warden. About 80 people applied for the job, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience made him the best choice.

Gareth's farming background helps him in his job. He can understand the problems of farmers and deal with them easily. He also knows how to do physical work like building fences and planting trees. Since becoming a warden, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation.

Gareth used to collect flowers, butterflies, and birds' nests when he was a child. Now, he realizes that farming has affected the countryside. He says that farmers and conservationists used to disagree, but now they are working together.

Gareth's job involves conservation, allowing the public to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He enjoys seeing projects finished and working with the public, except for some people who don't respect the area and its rules.

If you have common sense and like the outdoors, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. However, it's hard to get a job as a warden, so you might have to wait a long time.<|eot_id|>"

Meet England's Netball Captain

Suzie Ellis met with Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team, to talk about the upcoming World Championships. Kendra has been preparing for the event by training every day, including a morning teaching job and an afternoon training session in a local car park. She's so focused on her training that she doesn't notice the strange looks she gets from people passing by.

Kendra's whole life is now about getting in top shape for the World Championships. She's on a strict fitness schedule to make sure she's ready. This will be her fourth World Championships, and she knows it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 teams participating.

Having home support is a big advantage, and Kendra is excited about playing in front of a British crowd. She hopes that the team will do well and improve the reputation of netball in the country. However, she knows that there will be more pressure to perform, and the team will need to be at their best.

England's first game is against Barbados, a team they have beaten before but will be tough opponents. Kendra believes that the World Championships will be challenging, with no rest between games and only one chance to win. She thinks that the team needs to be ready to make the most of their opportunities.

In the 15 years she's been playing at the top level, netball has become faster and more competitive. Players are more aggressive, and the sport is taking a more scientific approach to fitness testing. As captain, Kendra thinks it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example.

Kendra has always planned her netball career carefully, and this will be her last big competition as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on the World Championships. When she leads her team onto the court for the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.<|eot_id|>"

'HOW TO HELP A CHILD WITH SPECIAL MUSICAL ABILITY

Many parents struggle to know how to support their child's exceptional musical talent. Some may not even recognize their child's abilities until they start to show signs of frustration. Schools usually focus on academic subjects, but children with exceptional musical ability need special care. This is where specialist music schools come in.

There are five music schools in Britain that provide a supportive environment for children aged 7-18 to develop their musical skills. These schools offer a unique combination of individual lessons, orchestras, and theory classes. Students spend most of their day on music-related activities, with some time for essential subjects like English, maths, and languages.

The schools are small and independent, with a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they are surrounded by like-minded peers. However, this can be expensive, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year.

Some parents may worry about the cost or the idea of sending their child to boarding school at a young age. The schools themselves are cautious about admitting children as young as 7, as they want to ensure the child is ready for the intense environment. They aim to produce well-rounded individuals, not just musically gifted ones.

While specialist music schools can be beneficial, they are not without their drawbacks. Some parents may feel that the academic programme is too limited, and musically gifted children may struggle with the pressure to succeed. It's essential to consider the child's individual needs and personality before making a decision.

For those who are equally gifted academically, there are alternative options. They can attend a school with a strong music department or combine their normal school routine with music training at a junior music college. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons and orchestral experience. However, this option may not be suitable for families living far from major cities.'

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her beautiful flower paintings. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are a bit wild and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path are very harmonious, with a mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is partly due to the previous owners, who were keen gardeners and left some plants that Susan liked. She also inherited a gardener named Danny.

Susan focuses on painting individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She often picks a flower, takes it to her studio, and paints it. It can take a few days or even years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is in the spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. She loves the way the flowers change shape and form over time.

Susan has always been interested in plants and used to collect wildflowers as a child. She didn't like garden flowers at first, but now she appreciates the beauty of all kinds of plants. Her garden is a mix of plants from around the world, and she lets them grow freely. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

Susan is busy preparing for two upcoming exhibitions and doesn't have much time to work in the garden. She has hired an extra gardener to help her, but she knows that to stay connected to her subject matter, she needs to get her hands dirty.

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, has been working as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France for two years. She cooks and cleans for guests who come to ski and stay in wooden chalets. Sarah graduated from Oxford Brookes University and works for a company that offers this kind of job. She enjoys it because she meets new people every week and it's a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down.

Sarah's day starts at 7 am when she walks to the chalet, where she has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. She makes sure they have a wide range of options, including porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and then either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She likes to ski as much as possible and usually stays on the slopes until 4:30 pm.

After dinner, Sarah takes a shower and spends time with the guests, chatting or relaxing. She likes it when guests are friendly and make her job enjoyable. On Sundays, Sarah has a busy day, starting early to prepare breakfast for the guests. She then cleans the chalet and does the weekly shopping if she hasn't already done it on Saturday.

In the evening, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests and helps them with their ski equipment. She then has dinner and sometimes goes out with friends to socialize.

'On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favourite Train Journeys

Andrea Thompson, Newsreader

I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago. I like to visit as often as I can. There's a train that runs along the coast from Cannes to Italy, and it's amazing. You see beautiful sea views and nice houses and gardens. It's always special, no matter what the weather is like. The train is popular with tourists and locals, and everyone is friendly.

Raj Patel, Explorer

I've been on many trains, but my favourite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. It goes across the desert. When I was a child, I missed a family train trip to Kruger National Park because I was too young. When I moved to England, I saw London Waterloo station for the first time and it was amazing.

Betty Cooper, Novelist

I have a special memory of the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon to Egypt. My husband gave me a pink dress on the train, and I loved it. The journey was relaxing and beautiful, and we saw many interesting things.

Martin Brown, Journalist

We were working on a project and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was not reliable, and the driver would wait for people to arrive before leaving. It was a unique experience, and we saw some beautiful landscapes at night.

Arisu Mezuki, Actress

I didn't grow up with trains, but I developed a passion for them when I was a teenager. I made a film about a railway in Yorkshire, and we used an old, disused track that was maintained by volunteers. When we weren't filming, we took rides on the train.

Want to get published? Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I've written a story/book, where can I send it?"" First, you need to research the market and find out about publishers. You also need to improve your writing skills. To do this, you should read widely and often. Visit your local library and bookshops to see what kinds of writing are popular. This will help you understand what publishers are looking for.

As you start writing, you might not know exactly what you want to write. Let's say you want to write love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories and read recent issues. Then, learn what kind of stories they publish and who their readers are. These readers will expect certain things from the magazine, and the editor will only accept stories that meet those expectations.

Many new writers send me their work, saying, ""I've been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone. But it's unlikely that the work is ready for publication. Most new writers send their work out too soon. It's rare for someone to be published with just one story. When you do finally send your work out, keep writing while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you'll become more confident. Don't give up – keep improving your work.

I also advise not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Every successful writer has faced many rejections before getting published. To advance your career, consider taking a creative writing course or joining a local writers' group. This will help you gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and write every day if possible.<|eot_id|>"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia at Baltimore station. There were more people than I expected. The station usually felt airy and clean, but now it was crowded. Elderly couples and college students were sitting on the benches, and a well-dressed man was walking around talking to strangers. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to New York. He then asked an old lady the same question, but she said she was going to Wilmington, so he moved on.

I noticed him asking other people the same question, and I thought it was strange. He didn't ask me, probably because I didn't look reliable. He seemed stressed and was asking people to tell him if they were going to Philadelphia. A woman reading a book told him she was going to Philadelphia, and he asked her for a favour.

He explained that his daughter was going to fly out of Philadelphia that afternoon and had forgotten her passport. He had told her to stay at the station and he would get someone to bring her passport. I thought this was a suspicious story, especially since he didn't want to go himself. He said his wife was in a wheelchair, so he couldn't leave her alone. I looked at the two of them and noticed that the man was holding a padded envelope, which seemed strange.

I wanted to make sure my family had time together. My wife took care of our children and did the accounts, and I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped our children, Gary and Joe, become confident. They would talk to our customers from a young age, which gave them a great start in life.

Finding a flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding a rare gem. The best way to do it was through personal connections. If you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, it often worked out. But if, like Jo, you had just moved to Dublin, it was tough. You had to stay in a hostel and search for a place. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was taking a big risk by moving there. She didn't even think about why she was going. Everyone at school had assumed she would move to Dublin. Who would stay in a small town? That's what she had heard. Some of her friends had moved to bigger towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family or friends who could help them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin on her own.

Jo's family thought it would be best if she stayed in the hostel, which was run by nuns. They would take care of her. Her sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for so long. But Jo didn't know what they were thinking about her. She saw an ad for a flat in Ringsend and decided to apply. It seemed too good to be true: her own room, TV, and shared kitchen and bathroom. It was close to her work at the post office.

People love dolphins because they are intelligent, friendly, and seem to understand human emotions. We often see them in movies and TV shows, but the reality is different. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dolphins are in a desperate situation.

Dolphins are found in many parts of the world, including the North Sea. Unfortunately, their numbers are declining. The population of North Sea harbour porpoises has decreased by up to 89,000. You might expect these popular animals to be protected, but they are not. This is a serious problem.

There are many different types of dolphins. Some live far out in the open sea, while others are found near European coasts. The bottlenose dolphin, for example, used to be common in British rivers and coastal areas, but now it is rare. The ones that remain are often injured and stressed.

Dolphins are in danger because of overfishing, which is reducing the world's fish stocks. This is a problem for porpoises and dolphins because they need to find food quickly. If fish in one area are removed, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They are also at risk of getting caught in fishermen's nets, which can be invisible to them.

Dolphins can also be harmed by pollution and human disturbance. They live in groups and use sound to communicate, but noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb them. This can have serious consequences that we do not yet fully understand.

""GETTING FIT Exercise is essential for our overall well-being. It helps us stay balanced in a world that's getting faster and more stressful every day. There are many reasons why exercise is good for us, and few reasons why we shouldn't do it. Exercise helps us build strong muscles, improves our posture, and prevents injuries. It also helps us improve specific areas of our body, such as our thighs, stomach, and arms. Additionally, exercise benefits our heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

But exercise is not just good for our physical health. It can also help us feel better mentally. It can ease depression and tiredness, regulate our sleep patterns, and even help us manage stress. Exercise can also help with certain medical conditions.

There are many types of exercise we can do, such as aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, and weightlifting. However, it's important to start slowly and carefully, and to consult a doctor if you're unsure what's right for you. Good posture is also important, as it can affect how we look and feel. By stretching our muscles, we can improve our flexibility and prevent injuries.

The best exercise routine involves a warm-up, stretching, a good workout, and a cool-down period. By following these steps, we can ensure that our exercise routine is effective and enjoyable.""

Despite the challenges, they find the experience rewarding because they get to capture the beauty and wonder of the natural world.

In an interview, Owen talked about their partnership and their approach to filmmaking. He said that they aim to create films that are rich in atmosphere and evoke emotions in their audience. He believes that if they can make people feel something, it is better than just providing information.<|eot_id|>"

Meet Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. She's been preparing for the upcoming World Championships, which will take place next month. Kendra's daily routine includes teaching at a local school and training in a supermarket car park. She's focused on her movements and doesn't notice the strange looks she gets.

Kendra is determined to be at her best for the championships. She's on a strict fitness schedule to make sure she's ready. This is her fourth World Championships, and she knows it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 teams participating. She's excited to have home support behind her and wants to improve the reputation of netball in England.

The team's first game is against Barbados, a tough opponent. Kendra knows that the World Championships will be challenging, with no rest between games. She believes that the team needs to be mentally prepared and focused to succeed.

In the past 15 years, netball has become faster and more competitive. Players are more aggressive, and Kendra thinks it's essential to train like world-class players. As captain, she wants to lead by example and support her teammates.

Kendra has been planning her netball career carefully and has decided that this will be her last competition as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on the World Championships. When she leads her team out onto the court, she'll likely have a tear in her eye, knowing that her loyal supporters will be behind her every step of the way.<|eot_id|>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends most of her time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research on marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater expeditions in a special vehicle that's like a small car. She dives down to the ocean floor to study underwater volcanoes.

The space inside the vehicle is very small, so she has to stay close to the two pilots. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can take up to 16 hours, including three hours to get to the bottom, ten hours to collect samples, and three hours to get back up.

If there's an emergency, Rachel can press a panic button, and a small escape vessel will be released. This vessel will quickly rise to the surface. Rachel has gone on six dives so far. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site near the Canary Islands. They studied a huge area of underwater volcanoes, where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She teaches and does research on underwater volcanoes, which she calls ""black smokers"". These are underwater volcanoes that produce black smoke-like water that pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

Rachel has had some scary moments during her dives, but she loves the adventure of exploring the deepest part of the ocean. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the underwater volcanoes, she feels a sense of wonder. She has studied black smokers for three years and was amazed when she finally saw them in person.

Here is the simplified text:

Making a good first impression is important. Research shows that people form an opinion about us within a few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our body language, and how we speak. Mary Pearce, a teacher, learned this the hard way. She had a small hole in her jacket during an interview, but she didn't change because she was running late. Unfortunately, the interviewer didn't get a good impression of her and she didn't get the job.

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, agrees that how we present ourselves is important. He says that people who take care of themselves are more likely to care about their work. Many people underestimate the importance of dressing professionally. Janet Goodwood, an administrative assistant, was shocked when she didn't get an interview for a promotion because of her clothes.

Our body language and facial expressions also play a big role in making a good impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 55% of our message comes from our facial expressions. It's important to make sure our words and body language match. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to show too much enthusiasm or eagerness for a job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, learned this the hard way. She was so excited about a job offer that she didn't get the salary she wanted.

Finally, it's a good idea to prepare for an interview by learning about the company and having a few questions ready. David Artesio, a manager, suggests that this will show your interest in the company and help you communicate effectively. Business consultant Marian Woodall advises against speaking in long, confusing sentences. Instead, use short sentences and highlight important points.

A NEW LIFE

Matt Froggatt used to work in insurance in the City of London. After 14 years, he found it wasn't fun anymore. He was made redundant and decided to start a sheep farm. He supplies meat to a local hotel and also sells it through the mail. He still works long hours, but it's different from being stuck in an office.

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising. He realized he enjoyed painting more than his job, so he took redundancy and became an artist. He and his family moved to the north of England, where they didn't know anyone. They're lucky that their friends still visit them.

Katherine Goodison used to be a lawyer. She loved her job, but the hours were terrible. She decided to start her own business making hats. She's happy and less stressed, but misses the social interaction with colleagues.

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years. He liked the excitement, but it wasn't rewarding. He was made redundant and decided to travel. He discovered his interest in health and became a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He's happy to have more control over his life and no regrets about changing careers.

**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

A Darius (runner) I've always been into sports. I played many sports when I was younger, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial with a professional football club, but I decided to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country's youth team and getting a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was a shame. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun - there are great athletics facilities and good nightlife. But you have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. My goal is to get to the next Olympics.

B Gabriel (surfer) In the surfing community, you meet the same people everywhere you compete. Professional surfers are very serious, and the best waves are often at dawn. If you want to succeed, you have to give up late nights. I don't mind that much, but I do love sleeping in. However, it's worth it because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships. After a win, I like to celebrate with a big night out, and if there's money involved, I'll go somewhere nice. And the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning the championship meant I got to present a surfing series on TV. Now, I'm a bit of a celebrity.

C Dieter (yacht racer) With five friends on a boat, we always have a good time. We're traditional and celebrate our wins in style. We don't actively seek media attention. Sometimes reporters are more interested in where we go out and what we do there than in our racing results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's great to get back and do normal things with friends from other walks of life. You can't live and breathe the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I'm not recognized in the street often. I'd hate to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one.

D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd's support. However, at the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with too many people around. Despite that, I do enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out and about. But it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players have to travel a lot, and that's why we split up, I guess. That was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport. I'm content to focus on my game now and catch up on other things in life when I retire, because that comes soon in this sport.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B2 learner:

Going shopping with children can be very stressful for some parents. They often feel like they are being asked for everything they see, from sugary cereals to Disney videos and comics. If they say yes, they worry they are buying their children too much junk food. But if they say no, they feel guilty and worried about disappointing their kids. Some parents try to avoid taking their children shopping, but they also don't want to deprive them of the experience of making their own choices.

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes while shopping. Companies spend a lot of money advertising directly to children, especially on TV. This can be confusing for children, as they don't always understand why their parents say no to certain things. The National Food Alliance says that parents are often worried about what they feed their children, but they may not always have the right information.

Some parents feel like they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced to say no to their children's requests. The Independent Television Commission has rules about advertising to children, but it's hard for parents to resist the persuasive messages they see. One mother says she has learned to talk to her children about different products and teach them to be critical of advertisements. This has helped reduce conflicts while shopping.

Parents also admit that they are not always consistent in their responses to their children's requests. They may say no to their children wanting sweets, but then buy junk food for themselves. Some parents suggest that supermarkets could make it easier for parents by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This could make shopping less stressful for parents and more enjoyable for children.

Ice Skating: A Fun and Challenging Activity

Ice skating has a long history that dates back thousands of years. Archaeologists have found old skates made from animal bones. In Scandinavia, skating was a popular activity among the upper classes. In the early 20th century, skating was considered stylish and elegant, but it wasn't until the 1924 Winter Olympics that a new, more athletic approach was introduced by 11-year-old Sonja Henie. Today, ice skating combines art and athleticism, requiring both skill and physical fitness.

To start, it's essential to maintain balance and control. The position of your body is crucial, with your legs slightly bent and knees bent to keep your body centered. Relaxation is also vital, as it helps you to move smoothly and efficiently. When pushing off with one foot, make a small movement with the other foot.

As you gain experience, you can increase the length of your movements. It's also important to learn how to fall safely. Even professional skaters fall, but by relaxing and using your hands to get up, you can minimize the impact.

Once you're comfortable moving on the ice, you can try different styles, such as figure skating, freestyle, and speed skating. However, it's best to start with figure skating and then move on to freestyle. Many ice rinks offer lessons and guidance to help you learn the basics and improve your skills.

To become a good skater, it's essential to practice regularly and focus on relaxation, flexibility, and movement. You can also combine ice skating with other activities like swimming or jogging to improve your overall health and fitness.

""Challenges and Rewards

Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and difficulties of their lives. 

A. Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to become a physiotherapist and compete in the Olympics. ""It's very hard work right now. I don't have time for TV, friends, or much else. I just focus on gym and school. Sometimes I feel very tired, but my coach gives me a day off when I need it. Usually, I just keep going - you can't take too many days off, or you'll get stiff.""

B. Annika's mother says that from a young age, Annika showed great potential. ""We didn't push her to do it. To perform at this level takes a lot of time and energy. You have to want to do it yourself. People say we've given up a lot as parents, but what they don't see is what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. She was a shy girl who used to hide behind me, but now she's made friends all over the world and has confidence.""

C. Sarah Stokes started show-jumping at 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""I'm lucky my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me to all the shows. The shows can last from one to five days. I don't get tired of it - I love it. I'm determined to do it, even if my parents weren't involved. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. Sarah's mother says that Sarah has always loved horses. ""When she was 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we have to travel all over England. We even sleep in our horse box to save money. Sarah is very organized and knows what she's doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""

E. Jane McShane, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone and it's fun. When I'm playing, I don't focus - I just look around. I'm not worried about getting too full of myself. I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like being embarrassed.""

F. Jane's mother says that Jane started playing chess when she was 5. ""My father said, 'Let's see if she likes it.' My father had tried to teach me when I was young, but Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that afternoon, she had memorized all the moves. By 6, she was beating adults. If she wanted to give up tomorrow, I wouldn't stop her. But I don't want to discourage her either. If she has this gift, let her use it.""<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain, standing at 228 cm tall. This is not surprising, as the average height of people in Europe is increasing by one centimetre every decade. More and more people are born who are very tall. However, this does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. Instead, we are returning to what our ancestors were like thousands of years ago.

For most of human history, people got their food from a variety of sources. They ate herbs, fruits, berries, and occasionally hunted animals. This way of life is still followed by some tribes today. Then, about 9,000 years ago, people started farming. This had a big impact on our diet and health. We started eating more carbohydrates like wheat, rice, and maize, which led to health problems like tooth decay and diseases.

In the past, people who switched from hunting and gathering to farming became unhealthy and underdeveloped. They were also shorter and weaker. This is because they were not getting the nutrients they needed from their diet. It wasn't until recently that people started to realize the importance of a balanced diet and began to make changes.

As a result, the average height of people in some countries, like the US, Holland, and Japan, has increased. However, this trend is not without its problems. For example, beds and furniture are still the same size as they were 150 years ago, and clothes manufacturers are having to make new sizes to fit taller people. The question is, how tall will people continue to grow? Scientists think that there may be a limit to how tall we can get, and that we may even start to shrink again due to climate change.

What's it like to be in a TV studio audience? I found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV shows, but many people don't really understand them. We often see them on game shows and wonder who these people are. Some people think studio audiences are made up of silly people who just want to be on TV. But this isn't true. People from all walks of life come to watch TV shows. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. TV shows try to attract different types of people for different types of programs.

You might wonder why people would want to watch TV in a studio instead of at home. One reason is that people might hope to appear on TV. Another reason is that they're curious to see how TV shows are made. But many people just got tickets from friends or family.

We often imagine what it's like to be in a studio audience, but it's not always what we expect. You sit among strangers, and someone shows you cards with words like ""APPLAUD"" or ""LAUGH"" on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This might happen in some TV shows, but not all of them. Some studio managers think that TV shows are good enough without these signs.

So, is watching TV in a studio different from watching at home? Some people think it's more exciting, while others enjoy the feeling of being part of a live show. I missed out on seeing the actors' faces because they were too far away. But for many people, going to a studio is just a fun and free night out.

I prefer places with a human touch. When I travel, I like to visit old villages and towns with interesting architecture, not just empty landscapes. When I was a child, I went to school in England and would often cycle to the village of Lastingham, which is situated in a beautiful valley. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. As someone from Scotland, I found the landscape familiar yet different, and I still visit the area to this day.

I also enjoy traveling by train. There's a small train that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, and I like to sit in first class because it's not much more expensive than the regular fare. The scenery is not particularly exciting, but I enjoy seeing the everyday life of people as we pass through their backyards. It's a reminder that even in a beautiful landscape, there's still ordinary life going on.

My friend Sophia likes the Hartland Peninsula, which is a remote and lovely coastline. The beaches are difficult to reach, so there are usually no crowds. She likes to reflect on the majesty of the sea and go for walks along the coast, which offer stunning views of the ocean. There are also beautiful valleys inland, full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers.

My friend Annette prefers the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland area that's perfect for hiking. It's a peaceful and remote place with few residents and visitors. She discovered it by chance when she was a student and has been returning every year since, often with her family.

My friend James has a special connection to Glenthorne, a beautiful house in Britain. He grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon, where he developed a love for the English countryside.

We're a family who loves animals. One day, my daughter found a beautiful pine snake and asked if we could keep it. I said yes, but only for one night. We had a special tank for temporary guests. I was late getting home, and when I arrived, I found my sons' bedroom in chaos. Domino, our cat, had caught a white mouse and was running around with it. I rushed in and tripped over something, but my eyes landed on the snake, which had escaped from its tank. It was slithering across the floor, and I was worried it might get hurt. I tried to catch Domino, but he kept running around with the mouse. I finally managed to grab the cat and pull the mouse out of his mouth. The snake was still escaping, so I sat down and slowly coaxed it back into its tank. When I finally felt brave enough, I released the snake's head, expecting it to attack me. But it just slid away and wrapped itself around my shoulders like a warm blanket. We stood there in the evening, my four children, the snake, and me. My oldest son said, ""You're nice and warm, Mum, and the shed isn't."" I asked the kids to gently guide the snake towards the door, and it slowly moved away. Without looking back, it slid up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail disappeared, my three-year-old son sighed and said, ""That was one big snake!""

'Write to me! In today's world of phones and emails, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is almost disappearing. But for me, there's something special about receiving a letter. It's exciting to wait for it to arrive, to see who it's from, and to enjoy reading the contents. I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember. My mother always encouraged me to write thank-you notes for birthday and Christmas presents, even if they were short or not perfect. When I moved to London to study medicine at 18, I would write to my parents every week. My mother and I would exchange letters, and sometimes my father would join in. The letters were about everyday life, but I remember them most. I also received letters from my boyfriends, who were away for work or study. Writing to them helped me express my feelings better than talking. I love getting birthday or Christmas cards with letters inside. It's even better when the letter is from someone far away, with beautiful stamps. I have penfriends in Sri Lanka, Australia, and Vancouver, and I also write to a lady in France. If we hadn't met in a restaurant, I wouldn't have known her address, and we wouldn't have started writing. Now we have a regular correspondence. I'm glad my children are carrying on the tradition.

Tens of thousands of ancient rock drawings in the French Alps are being damaged and may not survive for future generations. The drawings, which are 4,000 years old, show pictures of cows, fields, and gods and goddesses. However, as more tourists visit the site, they are accidentally or intentionally damaging the drawings.

The chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, Jean Clottes, is worried about the damage. He says that people think the drawings will always be there, but if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years. He has seen tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork. Some visitors even take parts of the drawings as souvenirs.

Researchers are divided on how to preserve the drawings. Some think that the best solution is to close the site to the public and only allow guided tours. Others believe that it is possible to let people visit the site, but with guides and restrictions to prevent damage.

The director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, Henry de Lumley, thinks that closing the site is the only way to save the drawings. However, others disagree, saying that this would cause problems for the local community. The regional architect, David Lavergne, thinks that charging a fee to visit the site could help raise funds to employ guards and prevent damage.

Another researcher, Annie Echassoux, believes that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. She thinks that it is not acceptable to say that there is no money to protect the site, as it is a historic monument.

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Shopping with children can be very challenging for some mothers. They often want everything they see, from the latest cereal to a Disney video or a comic. Mothers struggle to say no because they feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. However, they also feel bad for constantly saying no and getting angry with their children. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes while shopping. Advertisers spend a lot of money on TV ads, and supermarkets are where they are most likely to succeed. Children often don't understand why they can't have something, and the arguments about sugar being bad for their teeth don't seem convincing when compared to the attractive ads.

According to Susan Dibb, most parents are concerned about what they feed their children and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always accurate. It's good that parents and children discuss food, but if the only information children get is from TV ads, they get a one-sided view.

The Independent Television Commission prohibits ads from telling children to ask their parents to buy something, but the goal of ads is to persuade viewers to buy something. So, even if ads don't directly ask children to ask their parents, they still try to influence them.

Some parents find it stressful to decide which demands to agree to and which to refuse. One mother talks to her children about different products and labels, and they have few conflicts now because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are inconsistent and sometimes hypocritical in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, a father, says he refuses to buy sweets for his son because they're bad for him, but he and his wife buy double cream and chocolate for themselves. It's hard to be consistent, and it depends on how he feels.

Supermarkets could help by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This might encourage parents to shop without their children, which could attract more customers and make up for the lost sales.<|eot_id|>"

Climbing used to be limited to mountains and cliffs. Now, with new technology, climbers can challenge themselves indoors or outdoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, French climber Francois Lombard is hanging upside down by his fingers on a climbing wall. The National Indoor Arena, where the championships are taking place, is also famous for the TV show Gladiators. Both events use the same climbing wall.

In the past, climbers would practice on cliffs, but this was limited by the weather. In the winter, they would either brave the cold, go for a walk, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for top climbers to stay fit. They used brick edges or stone buildings to keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom. Many sports centers started building walls specifically for climbing, using bricks with special edges.

One teacher, Don Robinson, built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He created a block of concrete with natural rock inside, which could be used in a wall. Many walls were built in sports halls throughout the 1970s, but they had some problems. They could only be built straight up and down, unlike cliffs, which have overhangs and angled rock. Once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the same old routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a material that could be molded into shapes like those found on cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any wall and then removed when climbers got bored. French manufacturers also experimented with steel frames and interchangeable fixtures, which allowed for endless combinations of holds. This technology made it possible to build overhanging walls and create new climbing routes.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Do you want to become an actor? If you do, you'll probably hear people say that acting is a risky career. And they're right - there are many more actors than there are jobs available. When you decide to become an actor, some people who were your friends will tell you that you're crazy, while others might have different opinions. But it's a personal choice, and only you can take responsibility for your decision.

There's no easy way to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and there's no guarantee that you'll succeed even if you complete your training. It's a combination of luck and talent. However, there is always a demand for new faces and talent, and there's the possibility of excitement, glamour, and even big rewards.

I've been asked many times to define what makes someone talented. I think it's a combination of natural ability and imagination. The latter is the hardest quality to judge. It's also linked to a person's courage and confidence in what they're doing.

So, why do people want to act? It's often hard to explain why you want to do something. In the theatre, the most important thing is the moment when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what drives all actors to act, wherever they perform.

If you ask successful actors how they've done well, they might shrug and say they don't know. They might know some things about themselves and their technique, but they take nothing for granted. They know they're only as good as their current job, and their fame might not last.

Disappointment is the biggest enemy of an actor. You might be working one day and not the next. You might audition for a part, but it might not be yours. Actors try to protect themselves from the stress of competing and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. From the start, you're saying that you're available, willing, and talented enough for the job. It's up to you to care enough, because if you don't, nobody else will.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a B2 learner:

Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain, standing at 228 cm. He's not alone - people in Europe are getting taller every decade. In fact, we're returning to the height of our ancestors from thousands of years ago. This is because, for most of human history, people ate a variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and meat. They were healthier and stronger because of it.

However, about 9,000 years ago, people started farming and growing crops like wheat, rice, and maize. This changed everything. People started eating more carbohydrates and less variety of foods. This led to health problems and shorter stature.

In one study, researchers found that when hunter-gatherers started eating corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn was supposed to be a good thing, but it actually had negative effects.

Despite this, farming spread because it allowed more people to live on the same amount of land. But many people still didn't get enough nutrients. It's only recently that diets have started to improve, especially in countries like Europe, the US, and Japan.

As a result, people are getting taller again. In the US, the average height is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. However, this trend might not continue forever. There might be a limit to how tall humans can get.

Some scientists think we could reach a height of 193 cm, but others say that as a species, we might actually be shrinking. During the last ice age, humans were taller and rounder because it helped them stay warm. Since the climate warmed up, we've become thinner and smaller, even when we're well-fed.

As the planet continues to warm up, we might shrink even more. This means that the growth of humans could be offset by global warming.

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are turning their childhood game into a successful business. They're sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, playing the game of pichenotte with their grandfather's old wooden board. The game was introduced to their family by their grandfather, who brought it from Quebec, Canada. The family would play every weekend and holiday, and it became a big part of their lives.

Years later, the brothers decided to make a new pichenotte board, which turned out to be a great success. Friends and family wanted one, and soon they started selling them at local markets and craft fairs. The game was a hit, and people loved playing it. The brothers even started a championship and created a trophy called the Lord Pichenotte Cup.

As the game's popularity grew, the brothers decided to turn their hobby into a full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and started making more boards. They're now producing over 450 boards, made of birchwood and mahogany, which are durable and weigh 12kg each. The boards cost $595 each and are available on their website.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B2 level learner:

Welcome to the Model Village! When you first arrive, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this was a neglected piece of land covered in brambles. One person, with the help of his wife, transformed this land into the beautiful village you see today. They moved thousands of tons of soil and clay to create the unique landscape. Although machines helped, it also required a lot of hard work.

To make the village look like a real place, they planted hundreds of trees and shrubs. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they had to tolerate the salty air and strong winds. Many of the plants came from local gardens, while some came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The village was designed by Colin Sims, and he built over 100 models over nine years. The models are made from different materials, such as stone, concrete, and wood, to withstand all kinds of weather. Colin learned how to make the models durable by working with experts and experimenting with different techniques.

You'll notice that everything in the village is made to a consistent scale and has a lot of detail. This was achieved through patience and creativity. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used to build the models have been used in other model villages and even in college courses.

The buildings in the village are typical of traditional British architecture and are not based on specific places or buildings. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a 13th-century-style stone structure with a brick tower. As you walk around the village, you'll also see a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course.

Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models, as this could cause damage. You're allowed to take photos from the paths, but not from in front of the models. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. We appreciate any feedback you have about your visit, as it will help us plan new and interesting models. We're always updating and replacing models, so your input is valuable. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again soon!<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B2 learner:

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break their own rules. While some celebrities might agree to be photographed by paparazzi, most people in the public eye are upset when their private moments are shared on the front page. However, very few of them complain to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with these kinds of issues.

Rarely are these pictures in the public interest. Do pictures of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a famous actress's hotel balcony photo protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens pictures before and had a right to do so, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should have investigated this incident, but it didn't.

The PCC should also look into another recent story about a pop star's personal life. The star, like the actress, hasn't made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the initiative on this and other cases of invasion of privacy?

At first, this might seem like a good idea, but it's not that simple. If the PCC takes on this role, it would have to decide when to investigate and how to approach the person involved. If the person doesn't want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? There are many problems with this approach.

Additionally, celebrities and royalty might expect the PCC to investigate any story about them, and they would be upset if it didn't. The PCC would also have to monitor all British newspapers, which is a huge task. There's also the embarrassment factor to consider. Even if someone's privacy has been invaded, they might not want the further embarrassment of an investigation. Most people just want to move on with their lives.

One comedian was also a victim of the press, and he didn't complain because he was afraid the newspaper would run the pictures again with a new story, saying he was angry about it. This fear is understandable. People think they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It's hard to see an easy solution to this serious problem.<|eot_id|>"

Many people have advice on what to do after college, but what about moving to a second job? We're not talking about taking a temporary job while looking for a permanent one or leaving a job after just a few weeks. Instead, we're looking at those who are taking a step up in their career, choosing a job that fits with their long-term goals.

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your goals. Do you want to specialize in a particular field, take on more responsibility, or move into a new area? Whatever you choose, make sure it's a good fit for you. You should plan to stay in this job for at least two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job, as it shows you're serious about your career and willing to learn and grow.

It's also a good time to think about traveling. You can take some time off, come back, and then get a second job. Employers will be impressed that you've had the experience and won't worry about you leaving again.

Juliette Davidson is an example of someone who made a successful move to a second job. She worked for three solicitors after college, but there were no opportunities for advancement. So, she took a year off to travel and then got a job as a Personal Assistant to a Chief Executive. In just two and a half years, she's become more confident and her job has changed. Her boss has given her more responsibility, and she's now involved in a variety of projects and events.

Confident people: what's their secret? Many people think that confident people were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned. I spoke to five people who have developed their confidence and asked them how they did it.

A) Jenny was shy when she left school, but she surprised herself by doing well at her daughter's school. This experience helped her become more outgoing and confident. She learned that confidence comes from believing in yourself.

B) Michaela's father became ill, and she had to take over the family business. She was scared, but she learned that confidence comes from believing in yourself. She doesn't let fear stop her from doing things, and she reminds herself that she has nothing to lose.

C) Lisa is a TV presenter, and people think she's very confident. But she's actually very nervous! She's learned to look confident because it's important in her job. She's realized that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and that it's okay to be scared. She's also learned that confidence comes from doing things that scare you.

D) Barbara is confident because she enjoys her work. She's built up her confidence over the years by learning from her mistakes and working hard. She believes that you should like yourself for who you are, not try to be someone else.

E) Kim used to be too scared to speak up in meetings, but she eventually found the confidence to express her opinions. She realized that everyone gets nervous when speaking in public, and that the key to confidence is telling yourself that nothing is impossible.

The main idea is that confidence is not something you're born with, but rather something you can learn and develop over time. It's about believing in yourself, overcoming your fears, and doing things that scare you.<|eot_id|>"

I visited Malaysia for a kite-flying festival. Adnan Ali, a local, gave me one of his kites when it broke. He said it's a tradition to keep the kite if it breaks, and he had plenty more. We sat under a tree and looked at the many kites being prepared for the festival. There were 10 platforms where people held up the kites, and a row of competitors waited for the starting whistle. The crowd cheered, and the kites flew up into the air like rockets. The festival was held every year for five days, and over 500 people had registered to compete. Each person had made four different kites, which were judged on decoration, stability, and flying ability.

Adnan invited me to visit him at his home to learn how to make kites. I accepted and had a nice time drinking tea and eating snacks. However, I had to leave the next day, so I decided to explore the southern part of the state instead. I drove inland to Kuala Lumpur, but took a wrong turn and ended up at a river. A boat took me across, and I saw a sign pointing to a jungle trek. I decided to go for it, but didn't realize it was uphill and slippery. I met Baba, who ran a tented kitchen and huts, and decided to stay. The night was dark and full of strange sounds, but in the morning, I had a great view of the mountains. It rained later, and I got wet. I was worried about my car, but it was still there when I got back. Everyone I met was very friendly, asking me questions like ""Where are you from?"" and ""How old are you?""

HYPATIA: THE FIRST FEMALE SCIENTIST

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 370 AD. She was a very important scientist and one of the first women to be remembered in history. Her father was the director of the university in Alexandria, and he made sure she received a good education. This was unusual, as most women at that time had few opportunities to study.

After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas and wrote several important mathematical books. We don't have copies of her books today, but we know they were important.

Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented some tools to help her with her work. However, many rulers at that time were afraid of science and saw it as a threat. Unfortunately, this fear led to danger for those who were involved in science. One day, in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.

'Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grass, and they can be found in every part of the world. Grass can even grow in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctica. Grasslands support a wide variety of animals, from tiny insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass is very good at recovering after it's cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from the roots of the plant, not from the top. This means that many animals can live together in the same area without worrying about running out of food. When they eat all the grass, new growth will appear soon after, providing a fresh supply of food.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary: I used simpler words and phrases, such as ""successful"" instead of ""probably the most successful"", and ""very good at"" instead of ""recovered very quickly"".
* Shortened sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to follow.

Kal Kaur Rai, the winner of the Young Achiever of the Year award, has always been interested in fashion. She loves drawing and designing clothes. As a child, she kept her passion a secret from her parents, who own a supermarket. They expected her to follow in their footsteps and work in a business. So, Kal went to university to study management. After graduating, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. However, she couldn't afford the fashionable clothes she wanted to wear, so she started making her own. Her friends liked her designs, and soon she was making clothes for them too. A small shop in London took her designs on a trial basis, and they were a huge success. This encouraged Kal to leave her job and start her own clothing label. Her parents were supportive, which meant a lot to her. Today, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes over £500,000 a year. She has even designed clothes for famous pop stars and appeared in fashion magazines. Kal is grateful for her success and says, ""What I do is my hobby, and I get paid for it! But I've worked hard for this.""

The Ghan Train is a famous train that travels from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. It crosses the country, passing from the warm north to the cold south. The train is known for being late, but it's also a unique way to see Australia's amazing landscapes. The idea of building a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was first thought of in the 1920s, but it took a long time to complete because of flooding problems. The new line was finished just before my journey. The train is not very fast, with few stops and mostly holidaymakers on board. It's not a luxury train like some others, but the food is very good. The train was originally built to carry goods, not people. It's a special train because it's the world's first north-south transcontinental railway. When I boarded the train, everyone was excited to start their journey. Many of the passengers were Australian pensioners who were looking forward to the trip. Our first stop was Katherine, where some people got off to take a boat trip. I stayed on the train and didn't get off until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. We walked around the rock and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people break their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't very interesting, just flat land with cattle. But on the third day, we reached the foothills of an area near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train didn't meet all my expectations, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.<|eot_id|>"

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Scotland. It's a challenging climb because of its cold weather and steep slopes. I, Keith Hewitt, went on my first winter climb to the top of Ben Nevis. It was February, and our group planned to climb the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge, which is 600 metres high. We would camp for three days at the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the mountain. We took tents, sleeping bags, and special spikes for our boots because the snow was very hard and slippery.

Even though some of my group were experienced climbers, we took all the necessary safety equipment, including lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, but we were still a bit nervous. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The climb was steep, and my legs felt heavy. I had to rest more often because I was the weakest member of the group. The others would stop and wait for me, but then we would continue climbing. I promised myself to train better before future climbs.

After 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, which is only 1.5 metres wide and drops off on both sides. We had to be very careful and focus on each step. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye 48 kilometres away. But we were unlucky and a mist came down. Going down the mountain can be just as difficult as going up. We had to read the map carefully to avoid taking a wrong turn, which could lead to steep slopes that are too dangerous to climb in winter. I was relieved when I was back in the tent and could finally say I enjoyed the experience. At least I made it to the top!<|eot_id|>"

Our new school is an amazing place! It's made entirely of wood, just like our old school, but it's also very environmentally friendly. The builders worked on it for months, so we got to see the whole process. It was exciting to watch, but it was also noisy and sometimes the rain would stop work. We were worried it would never be finished! Now we have five big classrooms, a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. We even share one room with the town for meetings. The school is designed to keep the heat inside, so we don't need heaters. The heat comes from us, the teachers, and the computers. The building is also very good at keeping sounds inside, so it feels like we're in a concert hall when we sing. You'll also notice a tree on the roof - it was added by the builders as a special touch. The school gets its electricity from a wind turbine on a hill behind us. We visited it with our teacher and it's really big and fast! We're still adding some finishing touches, like a new stage for our play, but we're really happy with our new school and our teachers think we'll learn even better now that we're here.<|eot_id|>"

A letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside, I had my cheque book, address book, and my purse with £50 in cash and some credit cards. I didn't realize what I had done until it was too late. I was worried because I'm 72 years old and far from home.

I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man stopped and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened, and he gave me some money to get home. When I told the bus driver, he said I should keep the money. I got home safely, and soon the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He said they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. Amazingly, everything was still inside, including the money and credit cards. I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. They were very kind and honest.

Sincerely,
Mrs. B. James, Newport

'Sharks are often considered the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have special features that help them hunt underwater. Their excellent eyesight and special sensors on their bodies allow them to detect movement, making them a threat to smaller sea creatures that become their food. Although sharks share some similarities with other fish, they have some distinct differences. For instance, most sharks need to swim constantly to breathe and survive, so they don't sleep much. Additionally, if a shark is turned upside down, it can freeze in place, which is helpful for researchers who need to handle them. This technique allows scientists to learn more about these fascinating creatures.'

THE ICEHOTEL

For a long time, the Arctic was popular in the summer, when the sun doesn't set. But in the winter, the few people who lived there had the snow and ice all to themselves. In the late 1980s, people started to think that the cold and dark winter could be a good thing. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to show his art in a special igloo in a small town called Jukkasjarvi. The igloo, called Arctic Hall, was a big success and many people came to visit.

One night, a group of visitors had the idea to spend the night in the igloo. They loved it and that's how the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world.

Every year, a team of builders, architects, and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They use natural materials like snow and ice to build the hotel. The hotel is built in parts, and each part is opened to visitors and guests as it's finished. The building process usually starts in December and finishes on January 7th.

The hotel is built outside, so it's affected by the weather. When it gets warmer in the spring, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it's very cold outside. Guests are provided with warm clothing like overalls, hats, and gloves. It's also a good idea to bring extra warm clothing, like sweaters and socks, and shoes with extra space for thick socks.

If you want to visit the ICEHOTEL, you can buy warm clothing and other equipment on their website. You can order it when you book your visit, and it will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is in a village called Jukkasjarvi, near the Arctic Circle. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to get there.

A police officer who was called to the scene said that people got impatient and angry because they thought everything would sell out before they could get in.

Tanya Streeter is a world record holder in free-diving, a sport where athletes dive to great depths without breathing equipment. In 2003, she became the first person to dive 120 meters underwater and come back up without help. She had gone deeper before, but on that occasion, she used a balloon to return to the surface. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, breaking a record held by a man.

Free-diving can be a dangerous sport, and some people think it's too risky. However, Tanya believes that safety is the most important thing, followed closely by training. She trains regularly, spending two-thirds of her time at the gym, the pool, and in the ocean. She also uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness. To avoid injuring her knees, she doesn't run, but instead, she goes for fast walks.

When preparing for a competition, Tanya travels to different locations and does 14 dives over a four-week period, with a rest day in between. She needs to stay fit and avoid getting tired, as this could ruin her preparation. When she's not training, Tanya makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations by doing research or making films.

Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, where she loved swimming and exploring rockpools to watch sea life. She says that her life today is like living her childhood dreams. As a well-known figure, she thinks people are willing to listen to her when she talks about environmental issues. For the future, Tanya plans to continue breaking her own records and is not planning to retire from free-diving anytime soon.

'Cartoon films have no limits. If you can draw, you can make it move on the big screen. New ideas and advanced computer technology are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. In the 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for kids. But then, some directors came up with fresh ideas. They showed that cartoons could be enjoyed by both kids and adults. Not all cartoon films were successful, though. The Black Cauldron, for example, didn't do well because it was too scary for kids and too childish for adults. The directors learned from this and film companies started making a lot of money again.'

I never expected to land my first TV role in ""The Finnegans"" during my first year at university. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was 11. My grandmother thought I was similar to Polly Finnegan, and I always imagined playing her. Before university, I took a year off to travel to Chile. When I returned, my mom told me that the book was being adapted into a TV series. I knew I had to audition for the part. My mom sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I got the part and had to take three weeks off from university for filming. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on my missed essays. I didn't tell my university friends about my TV work, but they found out and thought it was cool. It was an incredible experience, and I feel lucky. After university, I plan to pursue acting as a career. Although I'm not from an acting family, my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles, but haven't received any offers yet. I'm not sure how I managed it all, as I also had a busy social life. After filming finished, I didn't know what to do. I've since appeared in two college plays. Now that my first year at university is over, I'm going to Greece with friends for the summer.

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Norwich, the capital of East Anglia, has a long history. It started as a small village near the River Wensum over 2,000 years ago. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had become one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has always been a city with a mix of different religions, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, the city celebrated its 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to become a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is a smaller city compared to London or Manchester, with a population of around 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. Norwich continued to grow and become richer, earning a reputation for having many churches and pubs. Although there are fewer churches and pubs now, the city has a new attraction - the University of East Anglia, which was built in 1964. This has brought a young and vibrant population to the city, along with a range of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. Norwich also has a football team, known as 'The Canaries', although the origin of this name is unclear.

The city's latest development is the Castle Mall, a modern shopping center. For over two years, the city's main car park was dug up to create a park with a roof, complete with water features and hundreds of trees. The old market, which is still in the city center, remains popular, and both the market and the new development are doing well. This shows that Norwich has successfully combined its old and new attractions.<|eot_id|>"

The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn, the city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States hosts a colorful event. The festival has been running for over 40 years and attracts balloons from all over the world. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate a local radio station's 50th birthday. Today, over 1,000 balloons from more than one-third of the world's countries attend the festival.

What to See During the festival, the pilots light up their balloons at the same time, creating a beautiful sight. This is called a 'balloon glow' and is a great opportunity to take photos. To see the 'glows', arrive at the festival site just after sunset or before 5:30 am. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and chat with the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all shapes and sizes, including animals, cartoon characters, and well-known brands.

You can also take a hot air balloon ride over the desert or ride a cable car to the top of the nearby mountains for a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other activities for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks displays.

Practical Tips Buy your tickets online in advance to avoid long queues. Wear layers of thin clothing, as it can get cool at night and early morning, but hot during the day. Bring a flashlight for night-time events, a camera, and high-speed film if you're not a digital photographer.

For example, wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, special heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. The Rainforest Zone is always damp because of a large waterfall.

The book is mostly made up of fiction, including short stories and parts of novels. There are some enjoyable pieces by well-known writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the less famous writers mostly wrote about food. I recommend avoiding Jane Harris' story, Those Nails, after meals because it has some unpleasant scenes that might make you feel queasy. The book also includes poetry from 19 poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are extracts from novels by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers.

""According to violinist and music teacher Margaret Porter, the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is because children at this age are curious and learning about the world around them. Margaret usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but has made exceptions for some five-year-olds who are very keen to learn. When she started teaching in 1972, her first students were her own children's friends who were five years old.

Margaret's students have group lessons with about 12 pupils in each group. They meet once a fortnight for an hour. Each student also has a one-on-one lesson with Margaret once a week. Parents are required to attend the lessons and show an active interest in their child's learning.

From the very beginning, students learn to play the violin by ear. They don't start reading music until they've been playing for several years. For a long time, there's a big difference between how well they can play and read music. Margaret's teaching method is not meant to produce professional violinists. Instead, she recommends that students who are very talented should leave and learn using more traditional methods.""<|eot_id|>"

Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has also joined the band as the drummer.

The first two songs on the CD are dance tracks, which is a change from their usual slow songs. These two tracks are very good and could become hit singles. The rest of the CD goes back to their usual slower style. Fans will be surprised by these new songs, but they are excellent. The singer, Rob Letchford, shows off his skills on these tracks.

Unfortunately, Rob had to record these songs before he had trouble with his throat, which has forced the band to cancel their next tour. However, fans who have already bought tickets don't need to worry, as the concerts will be rearranged once Rob is better.

Moonshine has shown that they can make great music in different styles, from slow songs to upbeat dance tracks. While the last few tracks on the CD are not as good as the first ones, 'Here again' is still going to be a big hit and bring success to the band.<|eot_id|>"

However, it was not the people searching for gold who became rich. Instead, those who owned banks and law firms made the most money and built large houses on one of the hills, which became known as Nob Hill.

Before that, the two shoes were the same shape and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now most are made in big factories using machines.

THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD

In the late 1800s, people came to Alaska in search of gold. A town called Iditarod grew quickly and became the largest city in Alaska. However, in the winter, it was difficult to deliver supplies to the town because the rivers and ocean were frozen. So, a special route was built for dog teams to travel to the town. This route was called the Iditarod Trail.

It took about three weeks for the dog teams to travel across Alaska. They would stop at special places called roadhouses where the drivers could rest and feed their dogs. The trail was used for many years until airplanes became the main way to travel.

In 1925, a serious disease called diphtheria spread to Nome, a city on the other side of Alaska. The only medicine to cure the disease was in Anchorage, but it was too far away. The pilots were not sure if they could fly in the cold weather, so the decision was made to use dog teams to transport the medicine. It took 20 teams of dogs just six days to complete the journey.

The journey was led by Leonhard Seppala and his dog Togo, who was very good at finding their way in the snow. The last part of the journey was led by Gunnar Kaasen and his dog Saito. At one point, one of the dogs, Balto, refused to go any further and saved the team from falling into icy water. Balto became a hero and the journey was a success. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the same route as the famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<|eot_id|>"

Each band had its own style, from our school uniforms to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like professional bands, but we're all used to performing, so the quality of our playing was amazing. Some players even created new songs on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when it was our turn to play!

Not everyone can join our jazz band, only about half of the students who want to play can. But those who are interested go to practice before school and sometimes stay after school to listen to jazz and learn about its history. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps across the country. Many adults are surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people who love music. I think it's exciting because jazz is both new and old - you can create your own music, but you're also part of a long tradition.

Gareth Ellis is a 13-year-old boy who comes from a family of three children. His parents, Alan and Kath, are an engineer and a nursery teacher, respectively. Gareth's older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always dreamed of becoming a clown. When his father lost his job, the family decided to join the circus together. Alan and Kath found jobs with a famous circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown, calling himself Bippo.

They travel with the circus during the summer and go back home during the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they're away. It wasn't easy for the family to make this change, but they managed to organize their new life. Gareth's parents were worried about his education, but they found a way to make sure he didn't fall behind. He follows the same schoolbooks as his classmates and has a computer to help him learn.

The family is happy with their decision, and Gareth is enjoying his new life as a clown. He hopes to become the main clown in a circus one day, perhaps in Bippo's circus.<|eot_id|>"

Eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8-18. Our members collect and write news stories, which are sent to newspapers, TV, radio, and websites. We have three centres in the country where members can meet and work on projects. Since we started in 1994, over 2,500 young people have joined us.

Sophie is an example of someone who benefited from Eighteen News. She was interviewed for an article about hip hop music and was impressed by the opportunities available. She joined the agency, got training, and became a member until she was 18. Eighteen News helped her develop new skills, and she now works at a major news website.

When you join Eighteen News, you'll get training and be part of a team that decides which news stories to write. We encourage members to share their skills with each other. More experienced members can even train new members and teach them journalism skills. We also have training sessions for new members three times a year.

If you're interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. Membership is free, and you don't need to take a test. Our programme is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels.

Welcome to Antarctica Sightseeing Flights!

Before booking your flight, here's what you need to know:

We take passengers on a 12-hour flight from Sydney, Australia, to Antarctica and back. The flight is usually divided into four parts: three hours to get to Antarctica, four hours over the continent, and three hours back to Sydney. During the flight, our expert guides will talk about the environment and history of Antarctica.

You'll get two boarding passes, and at the halfway point, you'll switch seats to ensure everyone gets a chance to see the amazing views. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half the flight, while economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half the flight.

While over Antarctica, we encourage you to get up and move around to take in the sights. The pilot will fly the plane in figure-eight patterns to give everyone a great view.

What if the weather is bad? We have 17 different flight plans to ensure we get the best views. Our captain chooses the route with the clearest weather on the morning of the flight.

Will you see penguins and other wildlife? Unfortunately, most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, so we won't be able to see them in detail. We don't land on Antarctica, mainly for environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you'll need to join a boat tour.

Can you take photos? Absolutely! All cameras are welcome, and we even have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold-weather clothes.

'Little Chefs: Cooking for Kids

On Saturdays, a group of children between 10 and 15 years old learn how to cook. The classes are very popular, and there's a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make delicious food.

Bill, who is 10, says he loves cooking because he can now make food better than his mum. The teachers make the classes fun, especially when they share the food they've made together.

Flora is 12 and loves cooking. She even cooked a meal for her friends, who really enjoyed it. Her mum suggested she take up cooking as a hobby instead of staying at home all weekend. At first, Flora wasn't sure, but she's glad she decided to join.

Philippe, the teacher, says it's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, but the kitchen can get a bit messy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents encourage their children to cook when they're young, they'll have the skills to make their own meals when they leave home.'

Driving in the winter can be challenging because it's hard to predict what might happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog can suddenly appear over a hill, and ice can be hidden beneath the snow, making it difficult to control your car. A car coming towards you might also slide across the road unexpectedly.

To stay safe, follow these two important rules. First, drive smoothly and avoid sudden movements. Sudden turns, braking, or acceleration can make your car difficult to control. Imagine you have a cup of hot coffee next to you and try not to spill it. Drive slowly and gently.

Second, pay attention to the road ahead and be prepared for anything. When there's a lot of ice, you need to look further down the road. Test your brakes by gently slowing down to see how long it takes to stop. Remember, you might be going faster than you think. On wet roads, leave double your normal stopping distance, three times on snowy roads, and even more on icy roads. Stay in control of your car at all times and you'll avoid trouble.<|eot_id|>"

Craigie Aitchison was a Scottish painter who moved to London to study art instead of law. He found it difficult to follow traditional drawing classes, but continued to paint. In his late 20s, the Italian government gave him a grant to study art in Italy, which inspired him to focus on the works of early Italian artists. He loved the bright light and natural colours of the Italian countryside and wanted to capture this in his paintings. To achieve this, he developed a unique technique of applying thin layers of colour, starting from light to dark. However, he never knows exactly what the final result will be. 

Aitchison believes that anyone can create beautiful colours, as they are easily available. What matters is how you combine them. He doesn't make sketches before starting a painting, as he might lose interest if he sees the final result too early. Instead, he makes many changes to his paintings before finishing them. This is why he prefers to paint people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's working. 

After moving to London, Aitchison didn't feel connected to the Scottish art scene. He doesn't follow any specific style or tradition, but paints in his own way. Despite this, his work has inspired many young British painters.<|eot_id|>"

'Rock Band Two years ago, my 14-year-old son, Ben, asked for a drum set for his birthday. We were initially hesitant because of the noise. Ben argued that playing drums was better than watching TV or playing video games, and it would keep him out of trouble. We eventually agreed, but with one condition: he had to consider the rest of the family and our neighbors when playing. That was just the beginning. Ben's bandmates started coming over with their guitars and other equipment, and our house became a rehearsal space for several hours a week. While it can be noisy, it's been good for our health - my husband and I go for a walk when the band practices. I must admit that, despite their unusual music, they're a friendly and polite group. They play at local clubs for young people, which is great. Our main concern is that their music activities might affect their schoolwork, but so far, that hasn't happened. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is certain, though: playing drums has kept him out of trouble and he's never bored.'

Instead of just studying, students aged 16-18 from all over the world get to learn outside the classroom. In the morning, they study, and in the afternoon, they do practical activities like helping on a farm, assisting people with special needs, or checking river pollution. What's great about Atlantic College is that students come from different backgrounds and countries. Because the fees are quite high (£20,000 for two years), the college offers grants. About a quarter of the students are from the UK, and many of them can only attend with government help. One student, Barbara from the Netherlands, said, ""I really appreciate how the college promotes understanding between people from different cultures. You learn to live with others and respect them, even if you don't always agree. After the summer holidays, my mom was surprised at how much less I argued with my sister!""

At 32, I've just finished my first year at university. I've had to adjust to attending lectures regularly and reading books quickly, as well as writing long essays. It's been a big change for me, as I've been away from the classroom for 14 years. Before coming to university, I was a secretary, but I was bored and unhappy because my job didn't challenge me. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who seemed happy and enthusiastic. I wanted to be part of something new and exciting. Now that I'm a student, I find it hard to connect with my younger classmates. They often ask me questions that I don't know the answers to, and I feel like I don't fit in with the lecturers because I don't have the same level of knowledge. However, I'm glad I made the decision to go back to school. I know that having a qualification is important for getting a fulfilling job, which is what I want. Unlike many 18-year-olds, I prefer spending my free time reading and studying rather than going out partying. I also appreciate the benefits of being a student, such as long holidays and discounts on theatre and cinema tickets. Sometimes I worry about what I'll do after I graduate, but I hope that going back to school at this stage in my life has been a good decision.

REBECCA STEVENS: THE FIRST WOMAN TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. Before she went on the adventure, she was a journalist living in a small flat in south London. In 1993, she left her job and family to join a group of climbers in Asia. Climbing Everest was a big challenge. 'I had to carry everything I needed on my back,' she said. 'I could only take what was really important. I didn't even take a toothbrush!'

Rebecca had to get used to living without water and washing facilities. 'There was no water on the mountain, only snow,' she explained. 'Water is very heavy, so we only took enough for drinking.'

Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, and it was the best moment of her life. After that, she became famous. She wrote a book about her adventure and now often talks about it to people. She also got a new job on a science TV programme.

Their parents were nowhere to be found. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do when autumn comes.' Bill had a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. He took them on short flights all summer, and they flew after him. When autumn arrived, Bill flew to Virginia, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and returned home. The next spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. But they didn't arrive. So, Bill flew to Virginia to find them.

Every six months, Stephen shears the wool to keep the sheep cool. Five years ago, Jenny started making sweaters from the wool and tried to sell them at local markets. However, it was summer and people weren't interested in buying sweaters. She then made socks instead. They were a hit because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business began.

Initially, Jenny made the socks at home, but as the demand grew, she had to send the wool to a factory where machines make the socks. Today, there are six colors, five sizes, and different designs for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is busiest during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift.

**Burglars Prefer Afternoons**

According to the police, most burglaries happen between 2 pm and 6 pm. Inspector Ian Saunders said that there has been a 30% increase in burglaries compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave their doors or windows open when they go out.

Inspector Saunders explained that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it's dark and they can't be seen easily. Many houses are also empty during this time because people are still at work.

To prevent burglaries, Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you're on holiday. This will help deter burglars. He also asked neighbors to keep an eye on each other's houses when people are away and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious.

When I'm at my mother's house, I can sleep for ten hours, which is great. However, after a concert, it's hard for me to sleep because my mind is still racing with music. Exercise is also important. Before my car accident, I used to go to the gym for two and a half hours, five days a week. Now, I do about 150 sit-ups every day because I'm not able to go to the gym as often. I don't drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat well. I also drink plenty of water, which is good for my health. I should drink around eight glasses a day, but I don't always manage to do that. It's essential to have a balance between work and leisure time. I love my job, but I also enjoy doing other things in my free time, such as listening to music or watching TV. It's good to take a break and do nothing sometimes. Since my doctor told me to eat better, I've been making an effort to eat more healthy foods like carrots and spinach. However, I still treat myself to burgers every now and then!""

Bollywood is the name of the Indian film industry in Mumbai, India. It makes a lot of films - almost 1,000 every year. Since 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films, which is more than any other film industry in the world. Most Indians enjoy watching movies more than any other free activity, and 10 million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films often tell romantic stories and feature singing and dancing. People all over the world enjoy Indian films, and last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.

Indian actors make more films each year than Hollywood actors, but they don't get paid as much. This is why Bollywood films usually cost around $2 million to make, while Hollywood films are never made for less than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but they usually only act for a few years. However, Amitabh Bachchan is an exception. He is considered one of India's greatest actors and has starred in over 140 films over a 40-year acting career.

THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE

In the past, London didn't have a police force like we know today. In 1700, only a few old men walked the streets at night to keep the city safe, but they weren't paid much. As London grew bigger, it became a dirty and poor city. Many people were afraid to go out because there were so many thieves stealing money. In 1750, a man named Henry Fielding started paying a group of people to stop thieves. They were like police officers and were called the ""Bow Street Runners"" because they worked near Bow Street.

Years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown too big and needed more police officers. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was created with 3,000 officers. Most of them walked, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are well-paid, and those who ride horses get even more money.

Dear Lorna,

I'm doing well. I'm excited to tell you that I got a new job in the city centre last month. I work at the Tourist Information Office, which is really interesting. My day starts at 7:30 am, so I have to wake up early. I like my job because I meet people from all around the world. I enjoy showing them around our city and telling them about its attractions. Here's a photo of me in my new uniform. What do you think of it?

THE OSTRICH

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh over 90 kilograms. Most ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they can't fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they're running. Ostriches are very fast runners - they can go from 65 to 90 kilometers per hour. It's hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are similar to chickens and take about three years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can survive for many days without drinking water.

Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding at 20. Now she's 23 and has won many competitions. We met her at a competition in Switzerland and asked why she started snowboarding. 'I like all kinds of sports, especially skiing. It's natural to start snowboarding. It's easy to learn and you can get good quickly.' We asked if she practices a lot. 'In winter, I snowboard every day from 8:30 am to 4 pm. I also run and bike. I love it all! I like competitions and being in the mountains. It's beautiful. But free-riding, doing what I want when I'm not competing, is the best for me.'

We asked what's important when learning. 'You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. You also need the right clothes, or you'll get wet. At first, you fall a lot, so it's important to be prepared.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened some sentences to make them easier to understand
* Removed some idiomatic expressions and phrases (e.g. ""It's so beautiful"" becomes ""It's beautiful"")
* Simplified some vocabulary (e.g. ""I just love doing it all"" becomes ""I love it all"")
* Removed some redundant words (e.g. ""especially skiing"" is implied by the context)
* Changed some sentence structures to make them more straightforward

Dear Sir/Madam,

I would like to book a room at your hotel from September 15th to 17th. I prefer a single room with a shower. Can I also have a phone in my room? I would like a quiet room on the ground floor. I'll be arriving by car, so is there a car park available? I'll be arriving around 10:30 pm. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? Can I have dinner when I arrive?

Here is the simplified text for a B2 learner:

Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, from a 7-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are several routes to the top, but the most popular one is the Marangu path, which is about 5 kilometers long. It takes around 5 days to complete and is often chosen by tourists. However, not everyone who tries to climb Kilimanjaro reaches the top. This is often due to the unpredictable weather. At the beginning, the weather can be hot and humid, but at the top, it can be cold and snowy, with temperatures below 20°C. Climbers need to prepare for both sunny and cold conditions by packing sunglasses and warm clothing.<|eot_id|>"

""Otters are not often seen by people. They live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. Otters are most active at night. They are excellent swimmers and can swim at speeds of over 10 kilometres per hour. Otters have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. They can also close their ears and nose, which allows them to stay underwater for several minutes. In the past, there were very few otters in Great Britain because the rivers were polluted and many fish and insects died. As a result, otters had a hard time finding food. However, the rivers have been cleaned up, and now there is plenty of food for the otters to eat.""<|eot_id|>"

'Building Construction

People have always built structures. We need homes to shelter us and protect us from the elements. We also build stadiums for sports events and concerts. Museums are used to store and display valuable items. Building a structure requires teamwork. The architect designs the building's appearance and creates drawings to visualize their ideas. Engineers ensure the building is safe and sturdy. Then, construction workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a distinctive roof. The Olympic Stadium in Munich is also notable, with a unique glass-roofed design resembling a tent.'

* Changed the title to a more straightforward one
* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary

Gail Rollins is a very good runner from Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run in the 10,000-metre and possibly the 5,000-metre races at the European Championships. In the past, Gail often came second in big competitions, but she always smiled and laughed about it. People in Edinburgh love her for her positive attitude. However, everything changed in 2004 when Gail ran her first half-marathon. She won the race in a very good time, which was the fastest time for a British woman that year. Gail's husband and manager, Mike Rollins, used to be a runner too, but he had to stop due to an injury. He still runs a bit and sometimes practices with Gail. But it's not much fun for Mike when Gail leaves him behind. Gail trains hard. She goes for a long run in the morning and then does some fast runs in the afternoon. She always takes a day off from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I'm with her all the time. Sometimes I tell her, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' She usually wants to eat cakes, but she can eat almost anything.""

His father, who loved playing the piano, taught him traditional Russian music when he was four. At six, he started taking piano lessons with a teacher in his city. Oleg won prizes for his piano playing and later went to music college in Austria for two years. He then returned to Russia. Josef Heptmann Josef's father was German, but he taught music in Poland where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he started playing the piano a year later.

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he became a children's book author at 60. Now, 13 years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he writes in his office. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read and get her feedback. She tells him if she doesn't like something. His 10 grandchildren, who don't live nearby, also read his stories and share their opinions. This helps Bill understand what children like to read.

Bill writes about life in his village and on the nearby farms. His favorite book is ""The Sheepdog"", which is about a farmer and his helpful dog. Bill loves animals, especially dogs, which are very smart and quick learners. Last year, his book was made into a movie with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used special computer technology to make it seem like the animals were talking. Bill was very happy with the movie.

In 1783, two French brothers built the first hot air balloon to carry people into the air. One hundred years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers in the United States built the first powered plane and flew it. Later, in 1918, the US Post Office started a mail delivery service using planes.

Over the next few decades, planes changed a lot. Then, in the 1950s, planes became much faster with the introduction of jet engines. In 1976, a special plane called Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2,500 kilometers per hour.

The fish here are incredibly diverse - I've seen red, yellow, and purple ones! Australia is truly stunning. We're not looking forward to leaving. See you at the end of September.

I made minor changes to the text to improve clarity and readability for a B2 level learner, while maintaining the original message and content. I:

1. Changed ""I'm having a good holiday"" to ""I'm having a great time"" for a more idiomatic expression.
2. Replaced ""the weather was bad and it was cold"" with ""the weather was poor and it was chilly"" to make the language more precise and natural.
3. Changed ""we go to the beach every day"" to ""we're spending our days at the beach"" to make the sentence structure more varied and natural.
4. Replaced ""Because the water was so warm, I loved swimming there"" with ""The water is warm, so I've been enjoying swimming"" to make the sentence more concise and logical.
5. Changed ""Australia is very beautiful"" to ""Australia is truly stunning"" to use a more vivid and descriptive adjective.
