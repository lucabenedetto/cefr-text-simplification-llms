'Charging for household waste: a complex issue

In many developed countries, people do not pay for taking out the trash. But is this really a good idea? Economists think not. The cost of collecting and disposing of waste is not zero. The more waste we produce, the more we need to pay for waste collectors and trucks. So, making households pay for their waste might encourage them to produce less and recycle more.

Some towns and cities have tried this approach. For example, in Charlottesville, Virginia, residents were charged 80 cents for each bag of waste. This might seem like a good idea, but the results were not as expected. People did produce less waste, but they also found ways to put more waste in each bag. This made it harder and more expensive to collect and dispose of the waste.

The study also found that some people started dumping their waste illegally instead of paying for it. This is a problem because it's hard to measure. The only positive result was that people recycled a bit more, but this might have been happening anyway.

The researchers also looked at the impact of price increases on waste production. They found that a 10% increase in the cost of waste bags only reduced waste by 0.3%. This means that making people pay a little more for their waste might not make a big difference.

So, is charging for household waste a good idea? It's not that simple. The effects of these policies can be complex and hard to understand. We need to consider many factors, including income and education, to make sense of the results.'

'Work and happiness. Are you satisfied with your job? Many people are not. They feel unappreciated and undervalued. Even those who have achieved success often feel unhappy. Loving your work used to be enough, but now it's not enough. You need to ask yourself if your job is good for you as a person. Are you able to talk to people outside your profession? Do you have time to learn new things and have fun? If not, no amount of money or status can make up for it.

I'm trying to find ways to make work more fulfilling. Instead of just doing a job for money, we should do it because it makes us happy and fulfilled. We need to rethink what we mean by 'work' and what it means to be a human being.

Many people are unhappy in their jobs. Even those in high-status professions like doctors and accountants often feel stressed and unhappy. Architects and administrators often feel trapped by their work. Only a few people feel truly fulfilled in their jobs.

I'm investigating different jobs to see how they affect people. I'm looking at how different cultures have valued work and how we can make work more meaningful. I'm also looking at how we can make our work more like a work of art, with the person at the centre.

For example, hotels could be more than just a place to sleep. They could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel workers could be more than just servants. They could be hosts who bring people together.

Work is a relationship. We need to rethink what we mean by 'work' and how we do it. We need to give people the chance to design their own jobs and choose their own colleagues and customers. We need to learn to communicate with each other in a more meaningful way. This is the key to happiness and fulfillment.'

'Broadcasting: How a Technology Was Shaped by Society

The word ""broadcasting"" originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand. This metaphor is not just about agriculture, but also about modernism. It's about planned growth and the possibility of a rich harvest. The idea assumes a central location with resources for spreading and reproduction.

We want to know why a new technology that sent words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor. Television, as a technology, is related to other two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone. It's surprising that, from its early days, television was seen as a centralized ""mass"" medium. This was in line with social and economic structures and the way people lived in modern societies.

There were some experiments with alternative forms of organization, but they didn't succeed. In the 1930s, some people in Britain experimented with two-way television as an alternative to the phone. They even published articles on how to build transmitters and receivers. However, big business and the government intervened and set standards for television equipment, which made it difficult for these grassroots efforts to continue.

Television was also seen as a way to compete with the film industry in the United States. In many countries, people watched TV in public settings, not just at home. In Britain, for example, most people watched TV in public places.

Despite some alternative ideas, television was largely organized around central broadcasting to individual homes. This was because manufacturers wanted to sell sets to as many people as possible, and people wanted to have TV in their homes. As people's living standards improved and they entered consumer society, they wanted to have entertainment and cultural experiences at home.

There is a connection between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting. As societies became more modern, they became more centralized, and people became more isolated. Centralized broadcasting was a way for governments to reach people efficiently and create a sense of national identity.

The text also mentions the importance of broadcasting in promoting democracy and equal access to information. However, the term ""broadcasting"" might become outdated as technology changes.'

'Clutter Sometimes, having many possessions doesn't make us feel secure. It's natural to want a home that meets our needs, but there's a point where we start to buy things for the wrong reasons. Advertisers use our insecurities to sell us things. They make us feel like we need something if we don't have it. To see how much advertising affects us, try not to look at billboards the next time you're out. They are very persuasive and can influence us without us even realizing it.

We're constantly surrounded by advertisements on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the internet, all telling us to buy more. On the other hand, caves have been studied by scientists and researchers around the world. They're a fascinating part of nature that sparks our curiosity and encourages us to learn more. Because caves are a natural part of our environment, people have been studying them for a long time.

However, visiting caves can be challenging, which means that not many experts have been able to study them. Instead, both professionals and amateur cavers have contributed to our understanding of caves.

Weather forecasting has a long history, dating back to the 17th century. We now have advanced technology that helps us predict the weather quickly and accurately. However, human experience and observations are still essential for making accurate weather forecasts.

'Opera and Theatre: A Different Perspective

I used to think that opera is primarily a form of theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first. This makes sense, as music is the foundation of opera. However, I come from a theatre background, where the spoken word is central and the audience and performers share a common language. In contrast, music performances often feature a minority of people who don't understand music, while the majority are impressed by the skill of the performers.

In music, audiences are often awed by the technical skill of the performers, just like watching an athlete in action. In theatre, audiences are more familiar with the performance and may not be as impressed by the actor's skill. This doesn't mean that theatre audiences are less demanding or less appreciative; they simply have different expectations.

I believe that music can learn from theatre in terms of building a connection with the audience. Music performances can be more engaging and immersive, like a theatrical experience. The conventions of music presentation, such as formal dress codes and deference to conductors, can create a sense of hierarchy. On the other hand, interrupting the performance with applause can disrupt the overall experience.

There are many initiatives to encourage new audiences to attend concerts and operas, and to break down barriers that make people feel music is not for them. I recall a remarkable community opera production that involved the audience in the performance. This type of innovative approach can lead to a more immersive and life-changing experience.

What I would like to see in music is a bit more experimentation and risk-taking, similar to what happens in theatre. This can involve using unconventional locations or formats, which can be challenging but also lead to exciting and memorable experiences. I believe that both music and theatre can thrive and bring joy to more people if we can find ways to bridge the gap between the two.'<|eot_id|>"

'I'm not a big fan of sand in its natural state. It's a barrier that gets in the way and makes a mess. When you're at the beach, it blows in your face, gets in your food, and swallows small objects. When it's wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step onto a towel or a carpet, it suddenly falls off. Sand is very persistent and can stay with you for a long time. I'm not a fan of sand, to be honest.

The search for a safe and secure home has been going on for a long time. People want to feel safe and protected. The idea of a lock and key is comforting. Recently, some companies have developed electronic locking systems, but people prefer the old-fashioned way of using a physical key. When a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they added a metal key to make it more appealing.

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern art gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some of it, but I'm not sure what it's all about. The idea is to let the art communicate with you, not to try to understand every detail. The new gallery provides information about the art, which helps visitors understand what the artists were trying to say. The labels explain the context and meaning of the works, which makes it easier to appreciate the art.'

""Every Picture Tells a Story

When we adapt a novel into a film, we have to make some changes. We have to remove some parts and make it shorter. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be interesting. When I worked on a script, I was surprised by how much I could remove from the original novel without losing the main idea. This doesn't mean that the original parts were unnecessary. It's just that the way we present information is different in books and films.

In a book, we can include more details to help the reader understand the characters and the story. In a film, we can show the characters and the story more directly. We don't need to include as much extra information.

Watching Movies

Going to the cinema is a special experience. It's like being transported to a different world. We can forget about our everyday problems and just enjoy the film. But when the lights come back on, we're back in the real world.

Some people used to think that movies were just entertainment, not a serious art form. But now many people consider film-making to be a serious art.

The Film Studios

The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing place. There were many different buildings, and it was hard to find your way around. The studios didn't make it easy for visitors to find their way. But the people who worked there knew their way around.

Many people want to make movies. There are many books and courses to help them learn how to do it. Some people even make successful films with very little money. For example, Robert Rodriguez made a film called El Mariachi for just $7,000. He became a famous director as a result.""

In the past, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. They were old and not very nice. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from a nearby factory would spread around the houses and gardens. People would often complain about the smell.

I don't remember much about my childhood, but I do remember sitting by the window and looking at the houses going away into the distance. I also remember my mother doing ironing in the back room of a house that wasn't ours.

My mother was a small, strict woman who was often angry. I never understood why she was angry, and I couldn't make her happy. Even when I was a child, I knew she was a bit strange. She was very alone, even when she was with other people. She had her own rules, which she followed very strictly. For example, she would get very upset if I walked on someone else's garden or if I didn't sit still for a long time.

My mother had some friends, but they were not very nice. They would talk about boring things like the weather and how difficult it was to take care of their children. I didn't like being around them.

Growing up in West Earlham was very routine. Until I was five, I just stayed at home and played with my toys. Then, I started going to school. The lucky kids had a bike with a seat for their child, but my mother didn't have one. Instead, she would ask other kids in the street to take care of me on the way to school.

The summer holidays were the best time. I would see the world outside West Earlham, like an old man who told stories about his time in the navy or a charity event where I got lemonade and tried to learn about a charity. But my mother didn't like these things. She thought people were only doing them for money.

My mother didn't like politicians and thought they were all corrupt. She would often talk about how they were only in it for the money. I think she was a bit unfair, but I also think she was very strict and didn't have much kindness in her.

Sometimes, my mother would take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at the paintings. She wasn't very interested, but she would try to make a joke sometimes. I remember one time she said, ""I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" when we saw a painting of a Roman soldier.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The sun was setting, and the air was humid and misty, making my walk feel secretive. I knew this street well from my childhood. I used to play with my friends who lived in the houses here. The houses were all different, with their own unique features, like the small gutters that led rainwater from the roofs to the sidewalk. As the street sloped downward, the houses became smaller and the yards got smaller too. Over the years, some houses that were once homes became shops, and some shops became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these spaces, especially those that used to be stores.

I visited the home of a furniture designer, Rick Gilbert, who lives in a former curtain warehouse. He wanted a cozy space, not an open-plan one, so he put up a wall made of corrugated plastic to separate his office from the rest of the flat. He also added a kitchen in the middle of the flat, which is a neutral zone where he can cook for friends or work with clients. To make the space feel more homely, he added some wooden floors and furniture given to him by his parents.

Bruce Chatwin was a famous writer who traveled a lot and wrote about his adventures. His book, In Patagonia, is a classic travel book that is full of imagination and romance. However, Chatwin often mixed fact and fiction in his writing, so it's hard to know what's true and what's not.

One summer, I went swimming in my pool during a heavy rainstorm. The raindrops created little fountains on the water, and I loved watching them burst and disappear.

Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, but walking, cycling, and swimming allow us to experience the unknown and the wild. A swimming journey would give me a chance to explore the unknown parts of Britain and regain a sense of wonder and adventure.

For example, a psychiatrist named John Bowlby discovered that crying helps develop the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that children cry mainly because they feel helpless. But why do adults still cry? The sound of crying is less important than the way it looks. It's possible that crying helped early human communities to build trust and feel connected to each other. We may also cry to show sympathy for people who are suffering unfairly. Sometimes we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. We might cry when watching a sad movie, and interestingly, this is more likely to happen when we're with others than when we're alone.

**The Heat is On: Understanding Global Warming**

Global warming is a well-known issue, but how much warmer will the Earth get and how will it affect our lives? Most people have a general idea of what global warming is, but few know exactly what will happen. A warmer climate will change the weather all over the world. Since the atmosphere affects everything on our planet, any changes to the climate will have big effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.

Humans have learned to use natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support our population. Any changes to these resources are serious. The problem is that we don't know exactly how the world will change and what's causing these changes. We do know that human actions have increased the concentration of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These increased concentrations are likely to continue and are already affecting the climate.

Scientists have been studying the relationship between atmospheric gases and temperature. They have found that the Earth has warmed by about 6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe that this warming is not natural and is partly caused by human pollution.

To predict the future, scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These programs use physical and chemical laws to analyze temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, these models are not perfect and have limitations.

Despite these challenges, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we've experienced before. The models suggest that the Earth's temperature will rise by 1-3.5°C by 2100, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts will become more frequent in some areas.

Climate change will affect the environment and human societies. It could change the location of ecosystems, the mix of species, and their ability to provide benefits. This will impact food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some areas will experience negative effects, while others might benefit.

For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have led to an increase in wheat production. However, many predicted effects of climate change will be negative. Small changes in climate can affect water availability, leading to droughts and water shortages. This will be a problem in areas where water is already scarce.

Climate change will also affect glaciers, sea ice, and ice sheets, which will impact vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. The Arctic's ice cover may even melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.

The most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the expansion of warmer water and the melting of ice. With many people living in coastal areas, the consequences of rising sea levels will be severe, including flooding, inundation, and displacement of people. This could lead to millions of environmental refugees.

The consequences of climate change will be devastating, not only for the people and culture of small island nations but also for the countries that will need to accommodate those who have been displaced.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of level B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

The existence of works of art can actually make it harder to understand them. This is because these works are physical objects that exist independently of our experience of them. We often think of a work of art as a building, book, painting, or statue that exists separately from the way it affects us. However, the true value of a work of art lies in its impact on our experience. Moreover, the fact that some works of art have been widely admired for a long time can create conventions that make it difficult to see them in a new light. When a work of art becomes famous, it can become isolated from the circumstances in which it was created and the way it affects people's lives. This can make it hard to understand its significance.

The task of art theorists is to bridge the gap between the refined and intense experiences that art provides and the everyday events, activities, and struggles that make up our lives. This is not an easy task, as we often separate art from the rest of our experiences and achievements.

In order to understand art, we need to consider the ordinary forces and conditions that shape our experiences. We need to look at the way art is connected to the world around us, rather than just focusing on the art itself. This might seem surprising, but it's true. To understand the meaning of a work of art, we need to forget about it for a while and look at the ordinary things that make up our lives.

It's possible to enjoy art without understanding it, just as we can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants. But if we want to understand the art, we need to start with the raw materials that shape our experiences. We need to look at the events and scenes that capture our attention and evoke our emotions.

Many people enjoy things that they don't consider to be art, such as movies, jazz, or comic strips. This is because they provide an outlet for our natural desire to experience enjoyable things. However, many people who criticize the traditional notion of art still share the same mistake. They separate art from the ordinary experiences of life, just like the traditional notion of art does. The times when art is closely connected to everyday life are the times when people appreciate it most.

It seemed that if an animal is too helpful, others may take advantage of it. So, why don't lions follow this rule?

Advertising in Trouble

The early 1990s were a challenging time for people who worked in advertising agencies. The economy was going through a recession, which meant that many companies were not making as much money as they used to. This made it difficult for advertising agencies to get the budget they needed to do their job.

In 1991, the situation was particularly bad in the UK. The economy was declining, interest rates were high, and many people lost their jobs. The construction and car industries were hit hard, with a 30% decline in sales. Advertising agencies were not immune to these problems and many people in the industry lost their jobs.

Those who remained in the industry felt under a lot of pressure. They were expected to do more with less, which meant coming up with creative ideas on a smaller budget. At the same time, companies were becoming more demanding, wanting to see better results from their advertising campaigns.

The recession also made companies question the effectiveness of advertising. They wanted to know what they were getting for their money and whether it was worth the cost. This put a lot of pressure on advertising agencies to prove their worth.

In addition to the economic challenges, the industry was also facing other difficulties. There were changes in demographics, the rise of retailers, and changing consumer needs and desires. All these factors made it harder for advertising agencies to produce effective campaigns.

As a result, many people in the industry were struggling to do their job well. They were under pressure to come up with creative ideas on a smaller budget and to prove the effectiveness of their campaigns. This was a challenging time for the advertising industry, and it required a lot of hard work and creativity to succeed.

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. Most of my friends didn't think it was a good idea. Cooking is a tough job. Chefs work long hours, have high pressure, and are poorly paid. But I didn't let that stop me. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard, and the social scene was snobbish. I thought being a chef would be a good change. It would be serious and honest.

I had my first taste of this ideal when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing. I still remember my starter. I felt happy and relaxed for days after. After that, I wanted to learn more about cooking. I read cookbooks, visited markets, and tried making new dishes. I even stopped studying for my history degree to focus on cooking.

We can't understand their world, so we dismiss it as weird. We prefer our comfortable lives with predictable risks like crossing the street.

**SAILING:**

Jonathan Raban loves to sail, but he's afraid of the sea. He doesn't claim to be a great sailor, but he likes writing about his experiences. He has a special device that shows him his exact location, but he prefers using traditional methods. He thinks the compass was a mistake, as it makes sailors focus on the device rather than the sea. Raban believes this has changed the way people relate to the ocean.

I've made the following changes:

1. Simplified vocabulary: I replaced complex words with simpler alternatives, such as ""unhappy"" instead of ""insular and self-important"".
2. Shortened sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter, more manageable ones.
3. Reduced sentence complexity: I avoided complex sentence structures and focused on simple and clear sentences.
4. Removed idiomatic expressions: I replaced idioms and colloquialisms with literal translations to make the text more accessible.

Summer is a great time to escape from home and enjoy reading. Reading can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate to the experiences described in books, even if they were written a long time ago or in a different place. Books can help us understand ourselves better and make us feel less alone.

When we travel, we can also escape the routine of our daily lives. Our eyes are more open when we are in a new place, and we notice things we might have missed before. We can feel grateful to others who share their thoughts and experiences with us through their writing.

The author of this article has written about his own travels and experiences. He has also written about the concept of ""ecotourism"", which means traveling in a way that is good for the environment. However, he notes that the term has been misused and overused, and that there is a lack of clear guidelines for what it means.

The author also talks about his own journey through Transylvania, where he stayed in different country houses and had a relaxing time. He kept a journal of his travels, but it was not always easy to write about everything that happened.

I have made some minor changes to the text to make it more accessible to a B2 level reader, including:

* Simplifying some of the vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removing some of the more complex ideas and concepts
* Breaking up long paragraphs into shorter ones
* Adding some transitional phrases to help the reader follow the text

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a B2 level learner:

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, but it has a long history. Historians of fashion believe that fashion, in the sense of style and design, has been around for a long time. They think that the rise of trade and commerce in the 16th and 17th centuries was a key moment in the development of fashion. As societies become more complex, people's needs and tastes change, and new ways of making clothes and accessories are discovered. This means that the meaning of different clothes and accessories can be different for different people and in different situations. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.

As for writers, it's not always easy to make a living. Some writers have other jobs to support themselves, while others, like me, do odd jobs to make ends meet. I've heard of writers who work for companies, like a chocolate factory, but I've never had that opportunity. However, many writers manage to write by juggling part-time jobs and using credit cards, and sometimes they even get help from other writers.

The passage below is about a musician who became famous suddenly. The musician and their band were playing small venues, but soon they were selling out and had to use secret entrances to avoid being mobbed by fans. They couldn't even leave the house without being followed by fans. The musician felt overwhelmed and out of their depth, but they also felt a strange sense of confidence.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases
* Simplified sentence structures
* Removed examples that were too specific or cultural (e.g. the reference to a chocolate factory)
* Kept the main ideas and themes of the original text intact
* Added a brief summary at the beginning to help learners understand the topic
* Used simpler vocabulary and grammar to explain the concept of fashion and its history
* Changed the example about the man's suit to make it more relatable to a B2 level learner
* Removed the reference to the writer's job as a teacher and workshop leader, as it may be unfamiliar to some learners.<|eot_id|>"

'Music in the Future

Technology is changing the way we live, work, and have fun. This includes music. In the past, we had more opportunities to listen to music on the radio, TV, records, and CDs. However, there was a decline in live music performances and jobs for professional musicians.

In the future, music will continue to be an important part of our lives. We will have more opportunities to listen to music, and people will be able to make their own music using technology. This could lead to a wider range of musical styles and genres.

Music is also good for us. Research has shown that playing a musical instrument can improve our spatial reasoning and social skills. It can also help us develop good study habits and concentration.

In the short term, there will be a continued demand for music lessons. In the long term, there may be a shift in focus. People may want to listen to more diverse music and use technology to create their own music. This could lead to a decline in the need for live performances by professional musicians.

To prepare for this future, music teachers will need to adapt their teaching methods. They will need to teach people of all ages how to play a range of instruments and develop their musical skills. Musicians will also need to learn how to work with large groups, communicate effectively, and manage their time.

It is important for the music profession to work together to raise the profile of music and show the public the value of music education. Music plays a big role in our lives, but it is often taken for granted.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level B2 (CEFR):

Actors often face criticism and dislike. Sometimes, they themselves contribute to this by talking too much about their work and themselves in interviews. They should remember what the famous dancer Pavlova said: ""If I could explain it, I wouldn't do it."" Instead, they often use clichés, truisms, or gossip. The famous actor Paul Scofield once wrote: ""An actor's work has life and interest only when they are performing. It becomes empty and theoretical when they talk about it."" He believes that an actor should start from scratch with each new play, learning and growing with the characters and the writer.

Adrian Lester's performance in Hamlet is impressive. He plays a young man who is struggling to find his place in the world. His acting is confident and natural, and he brings a sense of humor to the role. He is able to convey a sense of anger and frustration, but also of vulnerability.

What is acting? Is it imitating someone or bringing them to life? Who or what makes these characters come alive? This is the central question of the theatre.

One director's approach to rehearsal is to have the actors sit quietly while someone else speaks, and then think about what the words mean to them. They look at the script, visualize the scene, and find the reason to speak. This director calls this process ""dropping in"".

The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence has made a difference. The staff should have a sense of this too. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. The proportions of the auditorium are important, as they should respond to the human voice and body. The theatre should have a sense of history and human presence.

It's impossible to please everyone with every play. You can't guess what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to be surprised and experience something new.

In the 1950s, rock and roll music was mainly popular among young people, but it had a big impact on the middle class and older adults as well. It paved the way for the next generation of rock stars. For Paul Simon, listening to rock and roll on the radio was a big deal. He heard it on a show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, hosted by Alan Freed. This show was very popular among young people who wanted to listen to rock and roll music. Paul Simon was fascinated by the music and wanted to make his own music. He didn't know how to start, but he thought he could figure it out if he was careful.

Note: I have removed some complex sentences and vocabulary, and rephrased others to make them more accessible to a B2 level learner.

**Screen Learning**

Recently, I noticed my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while pretending to be a dinosaur. I asked him about dinosaurs, but he didn't know much. This made me think about whether learning from screens is effective. One writer tried an interactive programme with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The writer thought his son might have learned more if they had read a book together.

**Television and Learning**

Research shows that learning happens best when there is dialogue with a teacher or parent. Screens can be useful, but they shouldn't replace formal education. My son's dinosaur game is an example of how screens can be used in a playful way.

**Hollywood**

Hollywood has changed a lot since 1918. Back then, most film-making companies moved to Hollywood from other places. Some people didn't like the new film-makers, but they eventually accepted them because they were successful. Today, Hollywood is famous for making popular movies that make a lot of money.

**Photography**

Photography was invented by artists who wanted to create lasting images. They used a combination of light, lenses, and chemicals to produce pictures that were more realistic and detailed than paintings. Some artists didn't think photography was a real art form, but photographers knew they had created something new and important.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, it was common to include illustrations in children's books. Some of these illustrations are still valuable today. We can learn a lot from looking at these old books and the artists who created them.

'Blogging: Sharing with the World

Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of sharing your location online. The site said that when you post about where you are, you're not just telling your friends - you're also telling everyone else, including people you might not want to meet. This idea fits with the growing concern that there are downsides to sharing our lives online.

The internet offers many opportunities to share our thoughts, photos, and stories with a huge audience. We might think that this will bring us wealth, fame, or new friends. But often, we realize too late that the internet is a crowded and complicated place, and we're not sure how to navigate it.

Luckily, some people have been where we are now. In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers started sharing their lives online. They faced many challenges, including getting fired, losing friends, and dealing with the temptations of fame. These pioneers, who we now call bloggers, have already learned many lessons that we can learn from.

One of these pioneers is Justin Hall, who started posting on the internet in 1994. He shared his life, including photos and art, and built a large following. But he also faced challenges, including losing his job and dealing with the consequences of sharing too much.

Another example is Heather Armstrong, who started a blog in 2002. She wrote about her job and her personal life, but her blog was discovered by her boss and colleagues, and she lost her job. This experience taught her an important lesson: just because we can say anything online, it doesn't mean we should.

Heather's story shows that we need to be careful about what we share online and how we present ourselves. We can still share our thoughts and experiences, but we need to do it in a way that respects our relationships and ourselves.'

* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures

Sleep is a big problem in modern society. Many people don't get enough sleep, and this is affecting their daily lives. In the United States, 40 million people suffer from chronic sleep deprivation. Some famous novels have even featured characters who struggle with sleep. 

Researchers are studying sleep to understand why people need it and how they can get better sleep. One researcher tried an experiment where he let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. The results showed that people need around 8-9 hours of sleep each night.

In the UK, there is a sleep research laboratory at a university that studies sleep patterns. They investigate how sleep affects people in different situations, such as when they are tired or when they are driving. The researchers use special equipment to monitor people's brain activity and body movements while they sleep.

One study found that people who don't get enough sleep are more likely to fall asleep while driving. In fact, two cups of coffee can help people stay awake for up to 30 minutes after not sleeping at all. The researchers recommend using alertness products, such as energy drinks or caffeinated gum, to help people stay awake.

There are some things that scientists are certain about when it comes to sleep. For example, humans sleep in a daily cycle, and they switch between different stages of sleep. During the lightest stage of sleep, the brain paralyses the body to prevent injuries.

However, there is still a lot that scientists don't know about sleep. They are not sure what exactly happens during sleep, but they do know that women sleep for about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep.

Some researchers believe that sleep is important for the body to repair itself, but this is still a theory. Others think that sleep helps people to rest their brains and recover from the stresses of the day.

In the past, people had different sleep patterns. In the 17th century, people used to have two periods of sleep, with a break in between to relax and think. This was especially common among the poor, who used the quiet time to rest and reflect.

In some parts of the world, people still don't have a fixed bedtime. They may sleep for a few hours and then wake up again. This is because they may need to watch out for predators or tend to fires at night.

Overall, it seems that people all over the world need to pay more attention to their sleep patterns.<|eot_id|>"

The first real cowboy I met at the airport didn't even look at me. I used to be a racing driver, but I'm not anymore. I loved it, but it's hard to find a new job when you're used to being in the spotlight. I thought about becoming a TV commentator or selling classic cars, but neither worked out. Now I'm an ""ex-racing driver"" and it's tough. I miss the thrill of racing and the attention that came with it. Now I have a lot of free time, but I'm not sure what to do with it. As I looked at the desert landscape, I realized that even the birds were giving me advice: ""Get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out.""

Many people come to Vancouver because of its mild climate, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, and good education and job opportunities. The city has changed a lot in recent years, with new buildings and a growing tourism industry. Some people might complain about the rapid growth, but it's clear that the new arrivals and tourists have helped make the city more vibrant.

Journalists are not good at writing letters, it seems. They often struggle to write something that is not going to be paid for. This might be because they are always trying to make their writing as effective as possible, which makes it hard to be spontaneous. The best artists, on the other hand, don't think about the effect of their work, but just let their creativity flow. This is what makes them truly talented.

In the past, the opening of a new supermarket was a big event in Britain. Celebrities like soap stars and disc jockeys would come to cut the ribbon. Now, with new supermarkets opening all the time, it's not worth paying celebrities to do it.

""Citizen Kane: A Film Classic

When Citizen Kane was finally released in 1941, it received great reviews, but it was not a commercial success at first. It was only later, with the help of television, that it became well-known again. This film is often credited with inspiring people to become filmmakers. It's surprising, considering it was Orson Welles's first film.

Welles always said that the film's success was because he didn't know what he was or wasn't allowed to do, so he just went ahead and did it. He had a great team working with him, including a talented cameraman, screenwriter, and special effects expert.

The idea for the film came from Welles and his screenwriter, Herman J. Mankiewicz. They decided to create a character who was a newspaper magnate, similar to William Randolph Hearst. Welles realized that this was the perfect opportunity for him to both direct and act in the film.

In the film, we see a character named Dermot, who is worried about being late for a golf game. His wife, Carmel, is also worried, but she is more concerned about not doing anything with her day. She decides to go for a walk and look at the shops.

Now, let's talk about job titles. A recent study found that job titles can cause envy and conflict in the workplace. The study showed that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers would rather have a more impressive job title than a pay rise. This shows that people are very concerned about their status and labels.""

I went to Vienna to take photographs. It was my job to capture the beauty of the city. I loved the way the light fell on the buildings and the way a single picture could capture the essence of a moment. I believed that the perfect photograph was always just a second away, as long as I had film in my camera. I'd been a photographer for a long time, and I'd had some success. Once, a picture of a burning oil well caught the attention of newspapers and magazines all over the world. It was a lucky break, but I believed that you make your own luck, good and bad.

After that, I started working freelance, which seemed like a good idea at the time. But life had other plans. The mid-1990s weren't as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than in a more exciting location. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it.

The assignment in Vienna was a bit of a surprise. I had already taken pictures in London, Paris, and Rome for a coffee-table book called Four Cities in Four Seasons. But then the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, quit the job in Vienna, and they asked me to take his place. I was free and available, so I agreed. The publishers liked my work, and I was glad to go.

I stayed at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before, but it was different this time. I was alone, and I had time to really look at the city. I took a tram ride around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased. The weather was cold and grey, like the city's baroque architecture.

I didn't take any pictures on the first day. I just looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn to take pictures of Stephansplatz. The snow had fallen overnight, and the square was deserted and white. I didn't know how to capture the whole cathedral in one shot, but I was happy to settle for a partial view. It was magical, and I felt like I was a part of something special.

Photography has always been magical to me. Even when you know how it works, you still feel a sense of wonder. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz didn't surprise me. It's a feeling that stays with you forever.<|eot_id|>"

The Hayward Gallery in London has been transformed into a fascinating exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is a type of art that involves movement or explores the idea of movement. The exhibition shows how this type of art has been a consistent theme in the creative work of many artists over the past 60 years. The curator, Guy Brett, has brought together a wide range of artworks, including paintings, drawings, documents, and films, without using too much text to explain them. Visitors are free to make their own connections and discoveries.

Some people enjoy the art of David Hockney because it is figurative and easy to understand. Others might like his personality or the way he is portrayed in the media. However, some critics think that Hockney's art is not very good. But Hockney himself knows that his art is popular and doesn't worry about what others think.

As a curator, I have seen many art exhibitions that try to make a point or follow a specific theme. I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists to create an exhibition called ""Window-shopping"", where each artist showed their own work without any connection to the others. The artworks were very different, but they didn't interfere with each other, and some even complemented each other.

Some people think that art historians focus too much on theory and ignore the pleasure of looking at art. However, knowing more about an artwork can actually enhance our pleasure. Our enjoyment of art is influenced by the values of the society we live in.

'Metals

A long time ago, people might have started to be interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for fish to come close, and finding a shiny yellow stone. It didn't feel like a normal stone, so they might have picked it up. This could be how gold was first discovered. Because gold is soft, people soon wanted to use it a lot. Copper might have been found by accident, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they started to look for copper and ways to get it out of the ground. This is how metalworking became an important part of people's lives.

St Ives

As we walked down the narrow, cobblestone street to the center of town, the strong wind and rain made it hard to walk upright. The streets were empty, and all the shutters on the houses by the sea were closed tight. We had seen the weather getting worse as we arrived in St Ives by train. Coming to Cornwall without a car in the off-season didn't seem like such a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising walks along the beautiful coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it's gone. The people who lived in good times and bad are dead. The reasons why they moved or stayed in certain places, formed families and communities, have disappeared. Archaeologists can find clues, but we can't test our ideas by experimenting on living or dead cultures. We can't rewind time and watch what happened. Or can we? Computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and environments and create virtual communities with some of the same needs and abilities as real people. We can set rules for how they behave and create social groups. Then we can change the weather or the number of people and see how the virtual community reacts.'

Vervet Monkeys

In a group of vervet monkeys, a dominant male noticed a stranger lurking in a nearby tree. The stranger was trying to join the group, which would mean the dominant male would lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to cross the open ground to reach the group, the dominant male gave an alarm call, warning the group of a leopard nearby. The stranger would quickly retreat back to the safety of the trees. This happened several times until the stranger made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while walking across the open ground himself. The dominant male had successfully kept the stranger away.

Cats

In a small English village, people collected data on their cats' hunting habits. Over one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America used these figures to estimate that cats in Britain kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate. Most cats in Britain live in towns and have small territories, and they catch fewer prey than the cats in the village. The key question is whether the number of prey caught by these cats is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people in Britain feed birds, and garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, keeping the bird population high.

Buffalo's Day

In a marshy area, buffalo live with their owners. Every morning, they slowly make their way to the distant reed beds. They groan and complain about the long day ahead. Once in the water, they become lethargic and may spend minutes wallowing and complaining. They eventually swim away, their eyes indicating they are tired and may be drowning. They spend the day grazing on green shoots, their antediluvian heads held high.

Here is the simplified version of the text, suitable for a B2 level learner of English:

Photography has been used to record many aspects of human life and activity for over a century and a half. During this time, photography has become more advanced in recording time and space, allowing us to see things that are happening at the same moment or things that are very small or very far away. It has brought us images from all over the world, including distant parts of the solar system, and has shown us the complexities and challenges of modern life.

Photography has also been used to record events in the past, with the earliest forms of pictorial recording dating back to around 35,000 years ago. These early images may have been used to record events, to encourage people to hunt, or to decorate homes. Throughout history, people have questioned the accuracy of visual images and their place in society.

When photography was invented in the 19th century, it was seen as a way to provide a truthful record of events. The camera was considered a machine that could capture an image that was very close to what we actually see. This idea was important because it was thought that all people would be able to understand photographs, regardless of their culture or language.

However, as global communication has increased, we have realized that photographs can be understood differently by people from different cultures. This has made us question whether photography is a universal language. Photographs are often used to convey important messages, but they can also be influenced by cultural norms and biases.

Photography has changed a lot since it was first invented, and its role has shifted from being a way to record events to being a way to convey messages and tell stories. Photographs can be used to promote social and political change, just like other forms of art and media. For example, photography played a key role in the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance, and it continues to shape our media culture today.

**Writing Poetry and Other Forms of Writing**

Writing poetry, short stories, and screenplays can be a challenging task. To begin, it's essential to read widely and often, and to keep writing regularly. Don't worry too much about following rules; just let your imagination flow. Some people need a stable life before they can write, while others can write even in difficult times. The key is to find your own rhythm and style.

**Short Stories**

When writing a short story, keep it simple and concise. Avoid too many characters, long descriptions, or unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used to help the reader understand the story better. Dialogue is a great way to reveal different perspectives and keep the reader interested.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves carefully. The more you write, the more you'll understand the game. It's not just about individual moves, but about the overall strategy.

**Language and Writing**

Language is an instinctive part of human nature, but written language is not. Children learn to speak easily, but writing is a skill that must be taught. Writing systems have been invented only a few times in history, and it's not natural for children to invent their own writing systems.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced complex vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removed abstract concepts and philosophical ideas
* Simplified the language used in the text
* Removed examples and anecdotes that are not essential to understanding the main ideas
* Kept the main ideas and concepts intact to ensure that the text remains coherent and answerable.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at the B2 level:

I've never started writing a book with more uncertainty. I'm not even sure what to call it. The story I'm telling is not about a dramatic event like a wedding or a death. Instead, it's about my memories of a man I met occasionally, and I don't know what happened to him in between our meetings. I could try to fill in the gaps with my imagination, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write what I know.

To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I've given the characters in this story fake names. I've also tried to make sure that no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and it's possible that he never will be. If that's the case, my book will only be interesting because of its own value. But maybe the way he lived his life and his special character will have a lasting impact on the people around him, and even after he's gone, people will realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I'm writing about, and those who want to learn more about his early life will find something useful in my book.

I don't pretend that the conversations I've recorded are exact quotes. I never took notes, but I have a good memory, and I've written down the conversations in my own words. They're as accurate as I can make them.

I've taken some liberties with the conversations to make them more believable and interesting. I've done this for the same reason that historians do it - to make the story more engaging. I want my book to be enjoyable to read, and I think I'm justified in doing what I can to make it that way. The reader can easily see when I've used this technique, and they can choose to ignore it if they want.

Another reason I'm anxious about writing this book is that the people I'm writing about come from a different culture. It's hard to really know people, and I don't think you can ever truly know someone who's from a different country. People are shaped by their upbringing, their environment, and their experiences. You can't learn about these things just by hearing about them - you have to live them. And because you can't really know someone from a different culture, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never written about people from other cultures before, and I'm not sure how well I'll do it.<|eot_id|>"

'POETRY RECITALS At any time in history, people often find the literary scene confusing. It's only with hindsight that we can see the pattern of important writers and their work clearly. Today, there is a lot of confusion about different types of poetry, different ways of writing and presenting it, and different opinions about the role of poets in society. In general, the current debate in poetry is about the difference between writers who focus on publishing their work in books and those who prefer to perform their poetry in front of an audience. This division is not absolute, as there are many ways to promote poetry readings. Small groups in towns and cities organize events in community centers or private homes. Schools and universities invite poets to read and talk to students. Arts festivals often feature poetry readings by well-known authors. These events have many consequences, both positive and negative, for poets. For some poets, performing their work in public is essential. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand, and they can be enjoyed immediately. However, the same poems may not be as effective when read on the page. Poets who are dedicated to their craft may struggle to connect with an audience that is hearing their work for the first time. The danger is that they may compromise their artistic vision to appeal to a wider audience. Attending poetry readings can be enjoyable and educational, but it's important to remember that it's not a substitute for reading poetry on the page. It's best to either read the text while listening to the reading or have a prior knowledge of the poems. The main reason for popular poetry recitals is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to a wider audience, rather than just an elite group.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at the B2 level (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages):

**Oral History**

When historians ask people about the past, they must be careful. The person telling the story might not remember everything exactly as it happened. The historian also influences what the person says by choosing who to interview and what questions to ask. Even if the historian doesn't ask questions, just being present can change how the person remembers the past. The historian's own thoughts and ideas can also affect what the person says.

When the historian is not present, the person telling the story might remember things that they learned from others, or they might remember things that happened later. This can make it hard to know what really happened in the past.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animals: by looking at how their bodies work, or by studying their behavior in the wild. Some scientists focus on how animals' bodies work, while others study how animals behave in their natural habitats.

Some scientists study animals in labs, while others study animals in their natural habitats. Both approaches are important, but they look at different things. Even if we know how an animal's body works, we still need to study how it behaves.

**The Social Sciences**

When you start studying a social science, you have to learn two things at the same time. You need to learn about the subject itself, and you need to learn how to study it. Social sciences are not just common sense; each discipline has its own way of studying and thinking about people and society.

**Classical Architecture**

In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses and buildings. It was an art that involved order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought about how to make buildings look good, not just how to make them functional.

The origins of classical architecture are complex, but it is based on simple ideas about how to build a house or a temple. Even though ancient buildings might look fancy, they are based on simple ideas about how to build a shelter.

Here is the simplified text for a B2 level learner:

Lily's sisters kept her driving a secret from her husband, Chen. She would drive around the town, including the allotments and the gasworks, and then return home. Chen was amused by Lily's new skill and asked her to take him on a drive. They planned a trip for a Monday morning, when the streets would be less busy. Lily would practice driving around the allotments beforehand. Mui, Lily's sister-in-law, was a bit worried about Lily's driving, but Lily was determined to show her that she could do it well.

On the day of the trip, Lily drove impeccably. Even Mui was impressed. Chen was so proud of Lily that he applauded her. They drove along the seafront, past the gasworks and a lagoon with small boats. Lily parked the car in a quiet street near the sea. She was unsure about the road signs and didn't want to risk getting a fine.

After the drive, Chen joked that the car was old and worthless, which upset Lily and Mui. Chen then took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. Man Kee was fascinated by the grey water and the ships passing by. Chen decided that he wanted to teach Man Kee important skills, such as business, so that he could own his own restaurants one day.

As they were watching the sea, Chen spotted a ship on the horizon. He was excited to show it to Man Kee, explaining that it was a special ship that would take them back home one day. Man Kee was fascinated by the ship, and Chen was happy to see his son's interest. When they left the telescope, Lily was left with a view of seagulls flying in the ship's wake.

'I had read that if you dig a well deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched as I pulled up the bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn't think about the extra weight of the bucket or your lack of strength. You held the handle, and I fell into the well. I hit my head. I didn't think about it then, but later I realized that I had seen strange lights, like the stars in a cartoon.

At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. You called out to me, asking if I was okay. I was about to shout back, but you called again, sounding worried, and I stopped. I lay there, watching you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a bit, then pulled myself up and got out of the well.

I could hear people shouting and worried voices coming from the castle door. I ran the other way, hid in the shadows, and listened. My parents and Arthur came, and my mother was very upset. My father told Arthur to pull me out of the well. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows, feeling angry and scared.

I looked down and saw the spots of water from my wet clothes on the cobbles. I couldn't believe no one had seen them. My mother was screaming loudly, and it was very upsetting. I didn't know what to do. I had gotten revenge on you, but now things were serious.

The plan had backfired, and I was in trouble. I realized I had to think carefully about what to do next. I came out of my hiding place, stumbled forward, and fell down. I sat up, crying, and my mother held me. I told her I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and had crawled and swum through it. My father didn't believe me. He thought I was lying. He looked at me with a serious expression, and I knew I was in trouble. Arthur looked at me with pity, but it was a rebuke, too. I realized that my actions were not just childish, but also wrong. I was ashamed.'

Susan is leaving the family home now that her children are grown up. She notices that the removal company, 'Removers of Distinction', is taking everything out of the house. The removal men, led by Fred, are carefully packing up the belongings. The house is a lovely four-storeyed building overlooking a small harbour. Susan has many memories of her time there, watching her children grow up and leave. When they first bought the house, her son Robert was curious about how they would get it home. Now, Susan is worried about leaving the house, especially the piano. Her daughter Francesca is also helping with the move, making sure the piano is taken care of. Susan is surprised to hear that people often cry when they are moving, but she is trying to stay strong.

As Susan sits on the stairs, she remembers when they first moved into the house. The piano got stuck on the stairs, and it took a lot of effort to get it up to the top floor. She also remembers the time her husband, Peter, came home and helped resolve the issue. They eventually found a way to get the piano into the house, and it was a big relief. However, it took a while to get it professionally tuned.

Now, as Susan is leaving the house, she is worried about the stairs, which are not perfect anymore. She should have warned the removal men about the piano, but it's too late now. As she looks around, she feels overwhelmed and a bit panicked. Fred notices that she is upset and reassures her that they will finish the move soon. The piano is the last thing to go, and Susan is relieved when it's finally out of the house. She laughs with her children, Robert and Francesca, as they leave the house for the last time.<|eot_id|>"

'Online Book Reviews: A New Way to Share Opinions

The idea of the internet was to make it easy for anyone to share their thoughts and opinions with others. At first, it was hard to publish things online, but then Amazon, a popular online bookstore, made it possible for anyone to write reviews of books. Anyone could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a great idea because it allowed readers to see what other people thought of a book, not just what the publisher or professional critics said.

Amazon was the biggest online bookstore, and it got a lot of reviews. But with so many reviews, it was hard to make sure they were all good. Amazon had a team that checked the reviews to make sure they followed the rules. They didn't allow reviews that were just one word, or that were mean to the author, or that had bad language.

Some people tried to cheat by writing fake reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, wrote bad reviews about his own book and then wrote good reviews to balance them out. But when he wrote about it in an article, Amazon took down the fake reviews.

Authors could also write comments on their own books. Most authors wrote nice messages, but some gave their email address so readers could contact them. However, anyone could write a comment, even if it wasn't really from the author.

Some people got upset when they saw bad reviews of a book. When a book called ""We've Got Spirit"" came out, people who were in the book wrote angry reviews, but they were taken down. Amazon liked that people were taking the time to read and write reviews because it helped them sell more books.

The most important thing about Amazon reviews is that they are honest. Most people wrote serious reviews, and they helped others decide whether to buy a book. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing books was hard because you had to pretend to like books you didn't really like. But with online reviews, people can be honest and share their real opinions.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B2 level reader:

Art has changed over the last 200 years. We used to think that every artist had to be different and innovative. We admire artists who were ahead of their time, but we're not always open to new art today. We expect art to be unique and shocking, but we're not sure what that means. We want artists to be special and talented, but we're not sure what that looks like.

Let me describe a situation, and then I'll ask a question about it. Imagine an artist who chooses a text from an art book that talks about different types of pictures. The text says there are many kinds of pictures, and the artist decides to make a canvas with this text. The artist asks someone to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: is this a painting?

In the art world, it's common for artists to stick to what they're good at. If an artist is successful with one type of art, they usually keep doing it. But some artists try new things, and that's not always accepted. Eric Rimmington is an artist who is trying something new. He's known for painting still lifes, but now he's painting scenes from the London Underground.

I've escaped to a remote island with some books. I'm not sure why I came here, but the villagers think it's because I'm sick. I'm not happy or unhappy; I'm just suspended in my memories. I used to talk about the uselessness of art, but I didn't mention its benefits. As an artist, I find comfort in my work because it allows me to reorder reality and find meaning in it. Through art, I can fulfill my destiny and find joy, rather than trying to escape it.

""My dad said, 'It's no good.' We were driving back to London after I finished school. My dad and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school, a fancy girls' school. My dad was not happy. He had just met with my headteacher and found out that I would get a scholarship to Oxford University. He was worried that I would give up on the family business.

'I'm not going to fool you,' my dad said. 'You'll do what you want now.' He was talking about how I would use my certificates to get a good job. 'You're going to be a lawyer, aren't you?' he asked. My dad knew a lot about law and lawyers.

'I just said that,' I replied. 'I didn't know what else to say.' My dad continued, 'And you have the right personality for it. You're good at finding the important parts of a problem, you're good at talking, and you enjoy performing.' I said I didn't know about that, but my dad went on, 'I think your heart won't be in the business anymore. You'll go to Oxford, and then I don't see you wanting to work with us.'

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by the family expectations. I saw that there were many other jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore my options. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my dad. I wasn't as scared of him as my brother Maurice was, but I still found him intimidating.

'It's too soon to know,' I said weakly. 'You're not going to want me to join the business,' my dad said. 'It's a pity because you have the skills - brains, nerves, vision.' I mentioned my brother Maurice, who hated the business. My dad snorted.

We then talked about how I could help the family business in my free time, and my dad suggested I could be a consultant. I agreed, and that's what happened. I helped out during holidays and then left the business after I finished university.

Years later, my dad came to visit me and asked me to do one last job for him. It was a big deal for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my while. I was worried about my final exams, but my dad didn't understand. He thought I would be happy to help him, and he would be upset if I refused. I felt a bit overwhelmed by my dad's single-mindedness and energy. In the end, I agreed to do the job.""

Simon Costello knew that buying a house in Pembroke Square was a mistake soon after he and his wife Lois moved in. A possession that requires strict economy is not worth having. At the time, it seemed like a sensible and desirable move. Simon had a streak of successful cases and they were coming in regularly. Lois went back to her job at the advertising agency two months after the twins were born and got a promotion, increasing her salary to £35,000. Lois had argued more strongly for a move, and Simon didn't resist her arguments. They needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for their au pair. These things could have been achieved in a suburb or a less fashionable part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. She wanted a prestigious address, Mornington Mansions, which was not suitable for a young barrister and a successful businesswoman.

Lois decided that one of them should take public transport to work. Her office was on the other side of London, so Simon had to make the sacrifice. The crowded tube journey made him feel resentful and unhappy. He thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy, and how his grandmother would give him a warm welcome and make him feel relaxed. She was a 'lawyer's wife', always supporting good causes and attending lawyers' events.

Simon and Lois had discussed their careers before they got married, and they both knew how important they were to each other. Their lifestyle depended on their two salaries. But now, what they had achieved could be destroyed by Venetia, a woman who had come to their office and was furious. She had accused Simon of knowing that a client had bribed a jury four years ago and doing nothing about it. Simon denied the accusation, but it seemed unconvincing even to himself. He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering a similar situation from his past. Venetia's anger and disgust made him realize that his career could be ruined if this got out.<|eot_id|>"

**Heritage and the Past**

Heritage is important because it helps us feel connected to our past. We learn about our family history and the stories of our ancestors. This connection to the past is important for understanding our own identity and our future. Heritage is a way to understand who we are and where we come from.

We can learn about our heritage through stories, legends, and cultural traditions. In the past, people passed down stories and legends from generation to generation. However, with the growth of cities and changes in society, many of these stories have been lost. Today, we can learn about our heritage through museums, historical sites, and cultural events.

**The Fens**

The Fens is a region in England that is known for its unique landscape and culture. It is a place where the past and present come together. The author of a novel about the Fens, Graham Swift, chose to write about this region because of its unique character. The Fens are a place where nature and human activity coexist, and where the past and present are intertwined.

**Museums**

Museums are important places where we can learn about our heritage. They should make their collections accessible to everyone, not just experts. Museums should use displays and interactive exhibits to make history come alive. They should also provide resources for teachers and communities to learn about our heritage.

**Preserving the Past**

Preserving the past is important for our identity and our future. Change is a natural part of life, but we need to learn how to handle it. Preserving our heritage helps us understand who we are and where we come from. It is important for planners and decision-makers to consider the need for preservation and to find ways to balance change with the need to preserve our heritage.

Before Einstein, scientists thought about the universe in a different way. They believed that time and space were absolute. Einstein said that time and space are not absolute, but relative.

We didn't like most of these books, but they introduced us to some good stories and poetry.

The origin of language is a mystery. People have made many strange claims about it. Some think that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" to express fear. These sounds have been passed down in languages, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" or ""mors"" meaning ""death"". Many people avoid talking about the origin of language because they think it's a topic for weirdos. However, recently, scientists have been studying it a lot.

""Writing Reviews: A Practitioner's Perspective

Many reviews are written quickly and have a short lifespan. They are often limited in length and are only published for a short time, usually a day, a week, or a month. The temporary nature of reviews is often seen as a reflection of their importance. It's commonly believed that people only write reviews because they don't have time to focus on more important work. However, writing reviews is a challenging and multi-faceted job. It requires not only the ability to summarize a book or article quickly, but also the skill to control one's arguments and write clearly.

The length of a review is just one consideration. The reviewer must also think about their audience. They need to write in a way that is engaging for both casual readers and those who are already familiar with the subject. Additionally, reviewers need to have a broad range of knowledge and be able to write in a way that is easy to understand.

It's no surprise that many writers who review books also write other things. The American novelist John Updike, for example, enjoys writing reviews between his novels. Some people may feel that reviews are not worth keeping, but many writers believe that their best work is often buried in reviews. I, too, feel this way about my own writing.

In the English-speaking world, it's common for academics to write reviews in addition to their main work. This is because there is no clear distinction between reviewing and literary study. As a result, many academics write reviews as part of their job. While some people may still criticize academics for writing reviews, I believe that it's beneficial for both readers and academics. Reviews can help academics communicate their ideas to a wider audience and remind them of their responsibility to make their work accessible to non-experts.""

Ralph walked into his flat, feeling a familiar sense of ownership. It was a feeling he still got, even after three years, when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first moved in, he used to rush home early, eager to see what had happened while he was away. He thought the flat was a place where he could relax and be himself.

Over time, Ralph started to see his flat as an extension of himself. He would leave it tidy or messy, and it would always be waiting for him, unchanged.

Goat Racing

I was excited to watch a goat racing event on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. The atmosphere was lively, with many people, food stalls, and music. I had to push my way through the crowd to get a good spot. A special area had been set up for the competition, where the goats would run along a path. It was a challenge to keep the goats in order, as they are known to eat almost anything they can find.

Canoe Trip

As the day came to an end, I started to think about the night ahead. I was worried because our canoe was wet and we hadn't seen any villages or houses since morning. We couldn't find a place to camp. We used our torches to see the cliffs in the moonlight, but the batteries were running low. We continued on for a couple of miles, hoping to find a place to stop.

How to be Presentation Perfect

As a managing director, I am often required to give presentations to my colleagues and external stakeholders. I'm not naturally good at it, but I need to improve. How can I do this? Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many executives are expected to be good at it. To be convincing, you need to be convinced yourself. Show your passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. This means doing your homework and preparing well in advance. Ask colleagues to help you anticipate the questions your audience might ask. Start your presentation by finding something your audience can relate to and build towards your conclusion.

""Some things cannot be rushed. For example, if you're making mayonnaise, you need to add the oil slowly or it will curdle. Similarly, if you're fishing and your line gets tangled, pulling on it will only make it worse. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can speed up some processes, like solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But others cannot be rushed and will break down if we try to hurry them. 

Our minds have different ways of thinking and learning. Some things require quick, automatic reactions, like when you need to react to a sudden situation. Other things need more time and thought, like solving a problem or making a decision. 

There are three main ways our minds work: fast physical intelligence, thinking, and slow, contemplative thinking. Fast physical intelligence is like a reflex, and it helps us react quickly in certain situations. Thinking is the ability to reason and solve problems. Slow, contemplative thinking is more relaxed and allows us to reflect and ponder. 

All three types of thinking are important and necessary. We need to be able to react quickly in some situations, think carefully in others, and reflect slowly in still others. In fact, recent research has shown that slow, contemplative thinking is particularly useful when dealing with complex or unclear situations. It's like having a 'tortoise mind' that can help us make sense of things that are difficult to understand. 

Poets and philosophers have long known the importance of slow, contemplative thinking, and scientists are now starting to study it more closely. They're discovering that our unconscious mind can do many things more efficiently than our conscious mind, like learning patterns and solving complex problems. So, we need to give our minds time to think and reflect, and not rush through life.""<|eot_id|>"

I've been warmly welcomed to a research base in a very remote area. There are about 40 people here, including scientists, students, and weather forecasters. We all live together in a close community where everyone helps each other. My school French is helpful for basic communication, but I struggle to have conversations or make small talk.

Scientists' Motivation

I recently heard a radio program about scientists and why they do what they do. Some scientists were discussing why they want to know everything, from tiny atoms to huge black holes. They want to understand why we want to know all this. But I think it's more important to focus on whether what we're doing is right, rather than wondering why we're doing it. Science is a tool, and we should decide how, when, and why we use it.'

Food

Food is an important part of our lives. Many people enjoy cooking and preparing meals for themselves and others. But sometimes, we think that cooking is only for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. With a few simple ingredients, like carrots, leeks, and herbs, you can make a delicious soup. It's more satisfying than buying a packet or can of soup.

Cooking is also a way to show love and care for others. When we share food with others, it's a way to connect and show appreciation. This is why we often celebrate special occasions, like birthdays and weddings, around a table.

Joanna MacGregor is a famous pianist. She has a very busy schedule, but she still finds time to write books for children who are learning to play the piano. Many people are surprised that she takes on this extra work, but Joanna believes that teaching children is very important. She has written three books to help children learn the piano in a fun and easy way.

Joanna used to teach piano lessons to children when she was younger. She saw how some children were very talented and could learn quickly, but others struggled and gave up. She thinks that music should be available to everyone, not just those who are very good at it. She wants to make learning the piano enjoyable for all children, not just the ones who are naturally talented.

Joanna's new book, ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"", is designed to make learning the piano fun and easy. It includes stories and games to help children learn, and the accompanying CDs have music in different styles to keep children interested. Joanna believes that children should be allowed to improvise and experiment with music, and that they should be encouraged to play with both hands and use the pedals.

Joanna also thinks that practice is very important. She used to find it hard to practice when she was younger, but now she loves it. She suggests that children should set goals for themselves and work towards them, and that they should take breaks and reward themselves for their progress.

Overall, Joanna MacGregor is passionate about teaching children to play the piano and believes that it should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their talent or ability.<|eot_id|>"

Dr. Johnson believed that writing takes effort to be enjoyable. He thought that good writing is hard to achieve. I looked back at my old handwritten essays and was surprised to see how few corrections I made. Today, I would probably rewrite them several times. I think the reason was that writing by hand was physically challenging. This made me think more carefully about what I was writing.

Using computers can make writing easier, but it can also lead to sloppiness. Many writers spend a lot of time correcting their work on the computer. Unlike handwritten letters, emails can be more casual and lack the care and attention that goes into handwritten writing.

The author of a book called ""Mighty Micro"" predicted that the book would become less popular in the 1980s. However, this didn't happen. Reading long texts on a screen can be a frustrating experience, and people tend to dip in and out of texts rather than reading them from start to finish.

Ian Cuthbert was an old friend who had been given a large advance for this book. Lancelot had made a mistake by commissioning it, as Ian's temperament made it difficult to work with him.

'England's breakfast revolution The importance of breakfast is well-known, and experts agree that it's essential for our health. However, in the past, breakfast was not a common meal in England. In medieval times, there are only a few mentions of people eating in the morning, usually before a long journey or when they were ill. Most people didn't eat breakfast unless they were rich or royal. But in the 16th century, breakfast became more popular. Some people think this was because there was more food available.

Birds have always fascinated humans. We love them, fear them, and sometimes even worship them. But what does this say about us? A wren is bouncing against the glass of a greenhouse. Is it trying to tell us something, or is it just stuck? Wrens have been a part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the direction in which a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are often depicted in art and ceramics in British homes. The wren still has a special place in our hearts and minds.

Our relationship with birds goes back to a time when people relied on nature for survival. As a result, we developed a way of communicating about the importance of other creatures. This connection is not just cultural, but also ecological. It's a way of understanding the world around us.

The relationship between humans and birds has changed over time. For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed it bread. But it became seen as a pest and was eventually wiped out. Now, it's a symbol of conservation efforts.

Birds are important to us because they remind us of our own identity. We're fascinated by their ability to fly, sing, and be free. This fascination is a measure of our own sense of identity and our connection to nature.

In recent years, birds have become a way to measure the health of the environment. The loss of 30 bird species in Britain is not just a loss of natural beauty, but also a cultural loss.

Birds carry a lot of cultural significance. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are symbols of love, romance, and magic. The loss of these birds is a loss of cultural heritage.

Folklore is important because it helps us connect with the natural world in a way that's deeper than just scientific facts. The stories and legends we tell about birds are a way of interpreting what they mean to us. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our own backyards, we can't fully understand their significance without these stories.

The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past, and the mystery of the natural world.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the text, simplified for a learner of English at the B2 level:

Maps are used to show the relationships between different places and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, such as 'a day's journey' or 'an hour's walk'. However, this method did not provide accurate information about actual distance. Direction was also important, but for travelers, knowing where to go and how far it was did not require precise direction. For a long time, written itineraries were as useful as maps.

Today, some maps, like those showing railway systems, may not show accurate directions. Landmarks along a route were initially indicated by signs, which varied in size to show their importance. The conventions used on maps varied depending on their purpose and location, so it's essential to understand the specific convention used when studying early maps.

The history of cartography is largely about improving the accuracy of distance and direction measurements and the completeness of maps. Cartographers have borrowed from other sciences, such as astronomy and geology, to achieve this. For example, the use of magnetic compasses and instruments to calculate horizontal angles has increased the accuracy of maps. The discovery that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but is slightly flattened at the poles, has also led to improvements in mapping.

The demands on mapmakers have changed over time. Travelers, merchants, and soldiers have all had different needs. The development of artillery and the need for accurate representations of terrain features have led to the invention of contour lines. Today, cartographers must create maps for various users, including archaeologists, historians, and geographers, each with their own specific requirements.

The widespread recognition of the value of maps in many sciences has led to a modern renaissance in cartography. However, there have been periods of stagnation and progress, and cartographers have often had to wait for technical improvements before they could apply new ideas. Maps should not be accepted as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique without critical evaluation.

The many thousands of maps that have been preserved provide a valuable record of human thought and work, making the study of historical cartography fascinating and instructive.

""Language is a remarkable ability that allows us to shape each other's thoughts with precision. It is so deeply connected to human experience that it's hard to imagine life without it. People often talk to each other, even to animals or plants, when there is no one else around. I like to think of language as an instinct, like how spiders spin webs. They don't need to learn how to do it, it just comes naturally.

Climate and weather have a big impact on the lives of animals and plants. The type of climate can shape the landscape and affect the types of living things that can survive there. For example, warm and wet weather allows for the growth of tropical jungles, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas can only support a limited number of living things.

The daily weather patterns that make up the climate are caused by big movements of air in the atmosphere. The sun also plays a role in these movements.

Television and Art

Television often fails to create good programs about art. This is surprising, as TV can show a whole piece of art and then zoom in on the details. However, few TV shows have successfully captured the joy and complexity of looking at art. A recent example of what goes wrong is a series about American art by Robert Hughes. Hughes is a well-known art critic with a strong personality. He had eight hours to introduce British audiences to a type of American art that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks. Instead, it showed how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike**

In Hackney Wick, London, there's a special workshop where you can build your own bamboo bike. James Marr and Ian McMillan, two engineers, run the Bamboo Bike Club. They offer a course where you can design and build your own custom bike frame over a weekend.

Bamboo is a popular material for bike frames because it's sustainable and unique. However, most bamboo bikes are expensive, costing around £1,800. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable, so they developed a system to design and build frames that are both strong and affordable.

The course is fun and hands-on. On the first day, you'll learn how to select the right bamboo and join it together. You'll also use special tools and design blueprints to create your frame. James and Ian will guide you through the process, making sure everything is done correctly.

On the second day, you'll focus on building the lugs, which are the parts that hold the frame together. You'll use hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create a strong bond. Finally, you'll add the finishing touches, such as wheels, brakes, and a saddle.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at the B2 level:

Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought it would be a bestseller and it was. Dr. Gray's book is about how to understand each other better, especially between men and women. It's very popular and makes a lot of money. This kind of book is called self-help and it's very popular in the United States.

Self-help books are often criticized for being too easy or too complicated. But there are many good ones that help people improve themselves. Editors look for books that are easy to understand and have a good message. A good title can make a big difference. Some people write autobiographies, which are books about their own lives. But sometimes these books are not entirely true. The writer might leave out important details or make things up to make the story more interesting.

Detective stories are very popular and have been around for a long time. They often represent the struggles of society. The detective is like a symbol of good and the criminal is like a symbol of evil. The detective tries to catch the criminal and bring them to justice. The writer of detective stories, Dashiell Hammett, wrote about the corrupt society of his time.

There are many great science writers, but one of the best is Stephen Jay Gould. He believes that to write about science, you need to understand the culture of science. You need to be part of the scientific community and know its rules. Gould also thinks that you should never write down to your readers. You should use simple language, but not simplify the argument. If you patronize your readers, they will not like your writing.

Air-Conditioning at the Gym

Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, has turned up the air-conditioning to combat the hot summer temperatures. It's so cold that it feels like being in the Arctic! This is just one example of how air-conditioning is used excessively in modern life. Many buildings could use alternative methods to stay cool, such as using natural light and ventilation. These methods might seem obvious, but they can be effective and reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It's interesting to see that sundials are becoming popular again. These ancient instruments measure time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping accurate time. As clocks and watches became more reliable, sundials were relegated to being decorative garden ornaments. Now, they're being taken seriously again. Sundial maker David Harber believes their appeal lies in their connection to the planets. He says there's a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They're still, calm, and romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

Paint Your Own China

My image of china-painting came from watching grey-haired ladies demonstrate the art at an arts and crafts exhibition. Their delicate brushstrokes created perfect flowers and leaves. I wondered what kind of people would take a china-painting course. Would beginners have the courage to try? Surprisingly, the atmosphere was relaxed, and even the tutor didn't expect perfect results.

Keith and Dawne booked a package holiday to Venice, Italy, but something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel in Switzerland, not Venice. They arrived at Gatwick Airport and handed over their tickets to a woman in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. However, when they got on the plane, they noticed that the other passengers were a group of elderly people from the UK. They thought maybe there was a mistake, but the flight attendant said they were in the right place.

When they arrived at the hotel, they were surprised to find that they were supposed to stay there for 12 nights. They tried to explain to the receptionist that they were meant to be in Venice, but he didn't know what they were talking about. They met Mrs. Franks, who was in charge of the group, and she explained that they were actually booked for a different type of holiday. She said that the tickets and labels were similar, and that's why they ended up in the wrong place.

Keith and Dawne were upset and frustrated. They had been looking forward to a romantic holiday in Venice, but instead they were stuck in Switzerland with a group of elderly people. They tried to figure out what had gone wrong, but it seemed like a mistake had been made at the travel agency.

**Title:** American Managers Look to Ernest Shackleton for Inspiration

**Text:**

Many American business leaders are looking to Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer, for advice on how to manage a company. Shackleton led a team of explorers to the Antarctic in the early 20th century. He is now being studied by American executives because of his leadership skills and ability to make difficult decisions.

Shackleton's story is inspiring to many because he was a natural leader. He was able to keep his team motivated and safe even in the most challenging situations. He believed in being honest and open with his team, and he always put their needs first.

American managers are learning from Shackleton's approach to leadership. They are studying how he handled difficult situations, such as when his ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice. Shackleton made the tough decision to turn back and save his team's lives. He believed that the lives of his team members were more important than reaching their destination.

Shackleton's leadership skills are being applied to modern business challenges. For example, when a company is facing a crisis, leaders need to be able to make difficult decisions quickly. Shackleton's ability to stay calm and think clearly in emergency situations is an inspiration to many business leaders.

Shackleton's story is also a reminder of the importance of teamwork and communication. He believed that everyone on his team had a role to play, and he encouraged them to share their ideas and opinions. This approach has been adopted by many American companies, which are looking for ways to improve their communication and teamwork.

Overall, Shackleton's leadership skills and values are an inspiration to many American business leaders. His story is a reminder of the importance of honesty, integrity, and teamwork in business and in life.

**Questions:**

1. Why are American executives interested in Ernest Shackleton's leadership style?
2. What are some of Shackleton's leadership skills that are inspiring to American managers?
3. How did Shackleton handle a difficult situation when his ship got stuck in ice?
4. What is an example of how Shackleton's leadership skills are being applied to modern business challenges?

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at the B2 level:

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special kind of primate called the aye-aye. It has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker. Both woodpeckers and aye-ayes search for insect larvae by drilling into wood. Woodpeckers use their beaks and long tongues, while aye-ayes use their front teeth and a long, thin finger.

Scientists have been studying the aye-aye's hunting skills. They wanted to know how it finds insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson, a scientist, tested two male aye-ayes, two females, and an infant. He presented them with logs with holes drilled into them. Some holes had mealworms inside, while others were empty. The aye-ayes easily found the mealworms, even without seeing or smelling them. They didn't use their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects.

Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes use a special way to find the insects. They tap the wood with their middle finger and bring their large ears forward, focusing them on the spot in front of their nose. This helps them detect the hollow space below. They can also hear the insects moving when disturbed by the tapping. The aye-aye's way of finding food is similar to that of woodpeckers and bats, which also use sound to locate their prey.

The aye-aye's unique features also make it similar to squirrels. Its front teeth grow continuously, like a squirrel's, and it has been observed gnawing through nut shells and extracting the nut meat with its long finger.

Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but few of us know much about their lives when they were young. We often want to write down our memories, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a way to tell the stories of ordinary people's lives. She writes their autobiographies, which are at least 20,000 words long and include pictures if needed. She started doing this because she realized that many people's pasts were disappearing. 

She talks to people and writes down their stories. They tell her things they might not have shared with others, because she promises to keep their stories confidential. One man she interviewed said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were things that hurt, like my divorce, and the pain was still there."" He did it for his family, but hasn't shown it to his children yet. 

Hannah has found that many people's lives are shaped by what happened to them when they were young. They might make the same mistakes over and over again. She also finds that people often regret or resent things that happened with their parents, even after 60 years. 

Hannah is careful to keep her distance and not pry into people's private lives. She writes the stories in a way that is honest but respectful. Each book takes up to 30 hours of interviews, which she uses to write the story. She can even choose the color of the book cover and the title. The books are expensive, but people are willing to pay for them because they want to keep their family's stories alive.

A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology

The University Museum of Classical Archaeology is a unique collection of copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over 600 pieces in the collection. All the sculptures are exact replicas made from the original works, mostly from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The museum is located in a special building with good natural light. The advantages of having copies are that we can see groups of sculptures together, even if they are originally from different places. We can also see many famous works of art in one place.

B. Cambridge Darkroom

Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography. We have community darkrooms and a gallery that shows different types of photography. We offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels. We also have a membership scheme that allows members to use our darkrooms. We encourage young photographers to develop their skills and stock photographic books and materials.

C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology

The Sedgwick Museum has a large collection of fossils, rocks, and minerals from all over the world. The collection includes over 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original cabinets. The museum is arranged by geological age, so we can see how life on Earth has changed over time. The displays have labels that explain what each specimen is and how it is used today.

D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs

The University has a collection of over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The photographs show the landscape of Great Britain and how it has changed over time. We have a small display in the entrance hall and the library staff can help with any questions. We cannot lend the photographs, but we can make copies for you.

E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre

The Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre is a unique tourist attraction. You can create wall hangings by rubbing brass plates off medieval tombs. The centre has made copies of the originals so that we can preserve them and still enjoy rubbing the brass plates. The brass plates were a way to memorialize people in medieval times, and most of the original ones were destroyed. The majority of the remaining ones are in Britain, and we have the widest range of examples here at the centre.

A. The theatre director

I have been a father for 35 years, and I love every minute of it. I've been very lucky with my children. We all share the same interests: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has brought us closer together. Now that they're mostly grown up, I'm more like a friend to them than a father. I believe in setting a good example, and I've tried to be available for them whenever they need me.

B. The advertising executive

When my children were born, I was young and found it challenging to balance my responsibilities and limitations. It was tough, but it also kept me young. As they grew older, they introduced me to new things, like music and fashion, which has helped me stay connected with the younger generation. I've never felt out of touch. Although I missed some important events when they were young, like concerts and sports days, I've made up for it by taking them on holidays to the south of France.

C. The politician

As a politician, my work schedule can be demanding, but I make sure to prioritize my family. I only accept meetings and public appearances on weekends if they have facilities for my kids to join me. This way, they understand what I do and don't feel left out. I've noticed more and more politicians bringing their kids to work, and I think it's great that we're becoming more aware of the importance of involving our children in our lives.

D. The writer

I became a single father when my children were young, so I had to focus on being a good parent. I made an effort to stay in touch with them, even when they were growing up. However, I realize now that I might have treated them too much like adults. I regret not being more structured and setting clearer boundaries. I still worry about my daughters, and it's hard to let go.

E. The TV presenter

I was ready for a child, so we decided to have one instead of buying new things. Having a daughter has helped me understand who I am and what I want. It's a big responsibility, but it's also a great privilege. I sometimes feel overwhelmed, but looking at my daughter's smile always makes me forget my worries.

'Science in Space: A Unique Flight Experience

Journalist Tom Mumford joined 13 students from Europe and America on a special flight to test their scientific theories. The aircraft, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, looked like a normal plane from the outside. But inside, it was a unique environment. The seats were removed, and the students had to wear special harnesses to keep them safe. The flight was a rollercoaster ride, with the plane climbing up and then falling down. This created a weightless environment for the students to conduct their experiments.

The students had competed to get on this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative ideas for experiments to do in space. The best ideas won a place on the flight. The students were excited to be on this adventure.

During the flight, the students did experiments to study how objects move in space. One group looked at how cats land on their feet, while another group examined how metal joins are affected by gravity. Another team even tried to make solar sails using thin liquid films.

The flight was over after two hours, but the students felt exhilarated and excited. One student said, ""I was already planning to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."" This was an unforgettable experience for the students.'

I had a unique experience in New Zealand. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually their winter. My parents bought a small piece of land, and I, my brother, and sister could take care of it. We had to plant trees on the land. If we did, we could keep the land. My father was born in New Zealand, so it was a special connection. The land was not very good for farming, but it was perfect for planting trees. I had worked on sheep farms in Australia before, so I was excited to plant trees.

I started planting in 1968 and finished in 1972. It was a very wet winter, but it was a happy time. We would get up every morning, ready to plant more trees. It was hard work, but I enjoyed it. I had a friend who was experienced in planting trees, which helped me a lot. We would fill bags with trees and then plant them. The hardest part was making sure the trees were planted in straight lines.

After a while, planting trees became automatic. I would get into a rhythm and plant the trees quickly. It was also mentally stimulating. I would think about the natural world and our place in it. This experience had a big impact on my life.

I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and seen the trees grow. It's been satisfying to see them thrive. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but it's been good for the trees so far. I even wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green"", while I was back there in 1984. I stayed for three months and wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. The connection I feel to that place is still strong. It's a special bond between people and the earth.

We turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago. Since then, we've become known for taking care of orphaned animals. Recently, we received a cardboard box containing three small grey badger cubs. They were about eight inches long and had milky-coloured eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. The mother badger had been killed, and the cubs were cold and whimpering. We took them in and kept them warm by the stove. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.

We fed them with a syringe at first, but then they started drinking from a bottle. We had to wipe their faces with a warm cloth to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, we fed them every four hours. After a week, they were eating and moving around more easily.

However, Willow seemed lethargic one day, and unfortunately, he died from a lung infection. This was because we let him drink too fast from the bottle, which can cause problems in small animals. We continued to care for the other two, but six days later, a local farmer brought us another male badger cub, Willow II.

Willow II was a bit more difficult to feed because he was younger and had not learned to eat properly. It took him a while to get used to eating solid food. The other two, Primrose and Bluebell, were eating well and even started to play with each other. As they grew, they became more independent and started to explore their surroundings.

As the summer was very hot, it was hard for them to find food. We had to help them by giving them a special diet. By August, they were eating a variety of foods, including cereals, meat, and fruit. They even started to go for walks at night, chasing each other and playing in the long grass.

We also noticed that other badgers were visiting our field, probably because they were struggling to find food. We were warned that they might attack our cubs, so we took precautions to protect them. The local press wrote about our story, and people were so interested that we started a campaign to build a special home for the badgers. With the help of local businesses and a bus company, we built a sett with tunnels and a badger gate. The cubs loved their new home and would explore it before going on their nightly walks.

Eventually, they moved into their new sett, and we would often see them playing and exploring their territory. Although we don't see them as often now, they still come to say hello before going off into the night.<|eot_id|>"

'Tracing the path of a scientific pioneer

Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to recreate the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer who charted the variations of the compass in the 17th century. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley is best known for the comet that bears his name, but his work on charting the compass variations was just as important. Without this knowledge, sailors couldn't correct their compasses, making it difficult to navigate the oceans accurately.

Halley's journey was not easy. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Rio de Janeiro, but his first trip was cut short due to crew problems. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans.

Dr Clark is planning to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing his route. He will use more advanced instruments to make precise measurements of the magnetic field, which is constantly changing. This data will help scientists refine their understanding of the Earth's magnetic field.

Dr Clark became interested in Halley's work during a two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica. He believes that Halley's life was remarkable, not just because of his scientific achievements, but also because of his adventurous spirit.

Recreating Halley's journey will not only pay tribute to his legacy but also provide valuable scientific data. Dr Clark hopes to complete the expedition in four stages, with different crews for each stage. He is prepared to spend eight months at sea to achieve his goal.'

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How do these birds get away with having such a useless feature? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are trying to find the answer.

Charles Darwin believed that living creatures evolved over time through a process called natural selection. This means that the individuals best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and have babies. However, the peacocks' tails don't seem to fit this idea. They are a waste of space and can even be a disadvantage. Darwin thought that there must be another reason why peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails.

Alfred Russel Wallace, a friend of Darwin's, had a different idea. He thought that peahens must be choosing peacocks with beautiful tails because they have some other quality that is not obvious to humans. Wallace believed that the peacocks' tails are like an advertisement, showing off their good health or other qualities that are important for survival.

Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to figure out why peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails. Marion Petrie and her team have been studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to see if the peahens really do choose the males with the most impressive tails. They have found that the peahens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which is related to the length of the tail. However, they are still not sure if the males with the most impressive tails are also healthier or more successful in other ways.

One scientist, William Hamilton, has suggested that showy birds are often healthier and more disease-free. This could be why peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails. But the scientists at Whipsnade haven't been able to test this idea yet.

The team is also studying the offspring of peacocks that have been chosen by hens. They want to see if the children of these peacocks grow faster or are healthier than the children of peacocks that hens don't find attractive. If they are, then it would support Wallace's idea that peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails because they have some other quality that is important for survival.

Finally, a mathematician named R A Fisher proposed an idea called ""Fisher's Runaway"". He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the others, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail and the daughters will inherit their mother's preference for long tails. This could start a process where the males with the longest tails get more mates and leave more offspring, and the females' preference for long tails increases over time. This could explain why peacocks have such long tails. Interestingly, this would also support Darwin's idea that females choose ""beauty for beauty's sake"" once the process gets going.

This is unusual because most modern boats are designed with new technology and look very different.

I have my own boat, which is not as flashy as the ones at the boat show in London. It's designed for sailing, not for luxury. I like it because it's simple and easy to use. Some people might think I'm a romantic, but I just like the feeling of being at sea.

Some modern boats have too many gadgets and technology, which can make sailing less enjoyable. Sailing is about being close to nature and facing challenges. I think it's important to have a boat that's simple and practical.

I used to have an old boat called Hirta, which I sailed around Britain for a TV show. It was simple, but it was a great boat. I had to learn how to take care of it, but it was worth it. Eventually, I had to sell it because I got hurt and couldn't sail it anymore.

I built my new boat, The Westerman, from scratch. The designer, Nigel Irens, used a combination of traditional and modern methods to create the design. The boat is made of wood, which is strong and durable. It's not flashy, but it's a great sailing boat.

The Westerman has sailed across the Atlantic and has won several racing competitions. It's a timeless boat that doesn't follow current trends. I think it's a great example of how to design a boat that's both functional and beautiful.

**Health Farms and Country House Hotels: A Perfect Break**

I recently visited five health farms and country house hotels to see what they have to offer. I was looking for a relaxing break and a chance to recharge. Here's what I found:

**Henlow Grange**

I stayed at Henlow Grange for six days. The room was comfortable and cozy. I spent my days doing body conditioning exercises and taking classes like yoga and stretching. The instructors were very good and helped me feel more flexible. The hotel has many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and massages. The staff were friendly and professional. I left feeling relaxed and energized.

**Shrubland Hall**

Shrubland Hall is a beautiful stately home with a calm atmosphere. I had a medical check-up when I arrived, which included a weight and blood pressure check. The fitness instructor helped me with a shoulder problem I had. I followed a special diet and lost weight. The hotel has a gym, pool, and spa facilities. I enjoyed my stay and felt refreshed.

**Careys Manor**

Careys Manor is not a health farm, but a lovely old manor house. The food is delicious, but if you're counting calories, you might want to choose a lighter option. The hotel has a gym, pool, and spa facilities. I had a treatment for my shoulder injury and felt much better. The hotel is comfortable and relaxing.

**Cliveden**

Cliveden is a luxurious country home with a five-star hotel. It offers many health and beauty treatments, a gym, pool, and other activities like horse riding and tennis. The food is excellent, and the surroundings are beautiful. I enjoyed my stay and felt pampered.

**Springs Hydro**

Springs Hydro is a modern hotel with a focus on relaxation. The aromatherapy massage was amazing, and the carrot cake was delicious (but be careful not to overindulge!). The hotel has many therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments. I would love to go back.

These health farms and country house hotels offer a great way to relax, recharge, and take care of your health.<|eot_id|>"

**Natural Talents**

In just 7 million years, humans have not developed any significant genetic differences from chimpanzees. We are still very similar to them, with over 98% of our genes identical. This means that the things that make us human must have developed very recently. Our physical ability to create art, for example, must have come from a small number of genes.

Studies of animal behavior have shown that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to crack open shells. Monkeys even have their own language, with different sounds for warning calls.

If human art came from a unique genetic ability, it's strange that our ancestors didn't develop it until recently. The earliest evidence of human art is from around 35,000 years ago, in the form of cave paintings, statues, and musical instruments.

There are three main differences between human art and animal activities. Firstly, human art is not functional, it's not used for survival or to pass on genes. Secondly, human art is made for aesthetic pleasure, not just for communication. Thirdly, human art is learned, not instinctive.

However, these distinctions are not as clear-cut as they seem. Some animal behaviors, like bird song, may be motivated by aesthetic pleasure. And while humans learn art, some animals also learn their behaviors.

In fact, a study showed that chimpanzees can create art for their own satisfaction, just like humans. The paintings were not functional, and the chimpanzees did not intend to communicate with others. This challenges our idea of what makes human art unique.

'The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It's also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. These days, you don't find many big adventures or heroes. Charles Blackmore's great adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The name means 'once entered you never come out', but locals call it the Desert of Death. He told me about his amazing journey in his calm home.

The team he led consisted of four British people, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. Unfortunately, the handlers had never worked with camels before - they were long-distance truck drivers. This could have been a disaster! They set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's most inhospitable desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating book about their journey.

At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something. 'I had always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who I really was, outside of the Army. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back, as no one had ever done that route before. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was kind to us.

The team faced many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and dehydration. They lost part of their precious water supply. But they also found some water when they needed it most. They didn't experience the desert's famous sandstorms or extreme cold. Charles Blackmore says, 'What drove me on was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. We were completely on our own once we got into the sandhills.'

Charles Blackmore was scared at the beginning, but he was determined to finish the journey. He says, 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've been through so much; you've got so much behind you.' By the end, they were very thin but strong and muscular. Charles Blackmore felt proud of what they achieved, but he also knows that his family is his greatest achievement.

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? He still yearns for the challenge and the sense of purpose it gave him. He finds it hard to fit into modern life now.'

I recently decided to get rid of my gadgets and go back to doing things by hand. Everyone loves technology, and it makes our lives easier. However, I had a bad experience with my word processor, which made me realize that gadgets are not always worth the trouble. I started to get rid of some of my household gadgets, and it made me wonder what technology really gives us. Does it give us more time to do other things, or do we just buy more gadgets to fill that time? 

I was always a bit uneasy about those electric sewing machines that move quickly across the fabric. Now, I can sew by hand and take my time. I can even listen to the radio or talk to my family while I sew. It's a very relaxing activity. I used to think that sewing by hand was boring and tiring, but it's actually quite enjoyable. I can see the progress I make and feel a sense of satisfaction. 

I've also started doing things like washing up by hand, which I find quite pleasant. I'm now thinking about getting rid of some other gadgets, like the freezer and the microwave oven. We might even be able to save some money by not using electric lights.

Charles Hurst is a skilled cabinet-maker who has built a good reputation for himself over the past ten years. His workshop is located under a railway arch in East London and is filled with half-finished pieces of furniture and various types of wood. Hurst is always busy and doesn't waste time. He has a full order book for several months in advance, despite not promoting himself much. People know that if they want well-made furniture, Hurst is the one to go to.

However, Hurst is disappointed by the quality of some modern furniture and the fact that many craftsmen are not as skilled as they used to be. He believes that there are few true cabinet-makers left and that many people settle for low-quality furniture. Hurst is proud of his skills and is not afraid to show off his work. He is self-taught and has learned through trial and error.

Most of Hurst's clients are private individuals who come back to him again and again. He enjoys working with clients who know exactly what they want and are not difficult to work with. However, he also has some clients who are hard to please and change their minds halfway through the project. Despite this, Hurst is a humble person who is grateful for his success and is always looking for ways to improve his craft.

'Sleeping is an essential part of our daily routine. We spend about one-third of our lives asleep. Scientists are still trying to figure out why we need so much sleep. There are three main theories about the purpose of sleep. One theory says that sleep helps keep our bodies healthy. It's like a repair shop where our bodies fix any damage from the day and get ready for the next day. Another theory suggests that sleep helps us learn and remember things we did during the day. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to learn and remember new things. The third theory is about energy. It says that sleep gives us a chance to rest and recharge, so we have enough energy for the next day.'

'Eccentrics are people who behave in a way that is not normal or usual. But what is normal? We all have our own quirks and unusual habits. Some people love entering competitions, collecting strange items, or writing letters to the newspapers. Being eccentric means being true to ourselves.

 Inside us, there is a constant battle between being an individual and conforming to what others think is right. Most of the time, we choose to fit in with the crowd rather than stand out. People who have unusual hobbies or opinions often join groups to share their interests with others. They find comfort in being with others who understand them.

We all have a mix of individuality and conformity within us. We may feel the need to be different, but we also want to be accepted by others. This tension between being ourselves and fitting in is natural.

Some people have made a success of their lives by being true to themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous singer, is an example. He has said that when you do what you truly believe in, you will often surprise others.

However, being eccentric is not just about doing something unusual. It's about being natural and genuine. Eccentrics are not trying to be odd; they just are. They don't worry about what others think of them. They do what they do because it's who they are.

This is different from people who try to get attention or make a statement. Eccentrics are not trying to impress or escape from society. They just live their lives as they want to, without thinking about what others might think.'

She was a famous environmentalist who wrote about the importance of taking care of the planet. Her book, ""The Home of Man"", talks about how cities are growing and how we need to live in a way that is good for the Earth.

Another naturalist, Linda Bennett, chose a book about animal communication. The book, ""Signals for Survival"", was written by Niko Tinbergen, a scientist who studied animal behavior. The book is full of interesting stories and pictures that help readers understand how animals communicate with each other.

Lee Durrell chose a book that is very special to him. It's called ""My Family and Other Animals"" and it's about his childhood growing up in a family that loved animals. The book made him realize how important it is to care for the natural world.

Bruce Pearson chose a book called ""The Shell Bird Book"". It's a book about birds, and it has beautiful pictures of different species. The book helped him understand that there's more to birds than just identifying them. He learned that birds are also connected to music, literature, and art.

Finally, James Fisher wrote a book called ""The Shell Bird Book"" that was published in 1966. The book has beautiful pictures of birds by Eric Ennion, and it talks about different aspects of birds, such as migration and the history of birds in Britain. The book made the author realize that his emotional and creative response to nature was just as important as a scientific one.

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the impact of book reviews on a book's success. Here's what they said.

Publisher A Reviews are very important for us. A study found that many people buy a book because of a good review. Authors are happy with reviews, but publishers are more concerned about the number of words used to describe the book. A mix of positive and negative reviews can actually help sales.

Publisher B Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to get their books reviewed, preferably with a good review. Book reviewing is better now than it was 40 years ago, but there is still a problem with reviewing paperbacks.

Publisher C Reviews are essential for our business. Without them, we wouldn't be able to reach readers. When reviews are good, they can help sell books more than any advertisement. Readers trust a review from a respected reviewer.

Publisher D The relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK is complicated. In the US, a single review in The New York Times can make or break a book. In the UK, bookshop staff often don't pay attention to reviews, but some books that get consistently good reviews can eventually become popular.

Publisher E Of course, everyone wants long, positive reviews. But do they actually sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but the book didn't sell well. People thought they didn't need to buy the book because they had already read the reviews. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, people took note of reviews from certain authors, but now it's more about the style and quality of the review.

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, had a huge success with his first novel, The Horse Whisperer. Even before it was published, the book was a hot topic. Evans talks about his inspiration and his success.

At the beginning of the year, things didn't go well for Evans. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about his financial situation. He had no income for two years, and the bank was getting impatient. Instead of getting a job, Evans made a surprising decision. He bought a ticket to the US and spent three months researching his novel.

The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive and how a gypsy was able to calm it down by talking to it. Evans was fascinated by this and decided to write a screenplay. However, after the film project fell through, he decided to write the story as a book instead.

Evans spent the spring traveling across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt lonely and uncertain about his future, but he was determined to write his book.

When he returned home, he wrote the first half of the book. He was worried about his financial situation and needed to know if his book was worth continuing. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent, and he thought it was good enough to get an advance of $30,000. However, Evans needed more than that to pay off his debts and support his family.

In October, Evans sent his manuscript to seven UK publishers, and within a week, he received an offer of $75,000. The book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $53.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel.

Evans was amazed and grateful for his success. He decided not to write the screenplay for The Horse Whisperer and instead focused on writing another novel. He was proud of his independence and didn't want to become an employee of the film industry.<|eot_id|>"

Bobby Fischer, a famous chess player, is back in the game after 20 years. He is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's first game was impressive, but he is now 49 years old and not as strong as he used to be. Chess has changed a lot since Fischer's time. The game is now more competitive and fast-paced, with players needing to be in top physical and mental shape. The rise of professional chess has meant that players need to be well-prepared and focused to win.

In the past, chess was a game of strategy and skill, but now it's also about nerves and stamina. Players need to be able to think quickly and make decisions under pressure. The game is also more physically demanding, with players often playing for hours without a break.

Fischer's comeback is a big story, but it's not easy. He's up against younger and stronger opponents, and the pressure is intense. If he wants to win, he'll need to be in top form and stay focused. The prize money is a big incentive, but Fischer's motivation is not just about the money. He wants to prove that he's still the best player in the world.

Volunteer tourism Four experts discuss the topic of international volunteering.

A. Some people argue that volunteering abroad doesn't really make a big difference. This is because many volunteers pay a fee to participate, which could be used to hire more local workers. For example, during gap years, the skills and experience required are often very basic. This raises questions about whether people are really motivated to help others or if they are just looking for personal benefits.

B. Volunteering can lead to better understanding between countries, improved conflict resolution, and more global participation in social issues. It can also create a network of international connections among ordinary people. The benefits of volunteering can be shared by both the volunteers and the host communities, and can contribute to the greater good.

C. Unfortunately, international volunteering can sometimes be a way for wealthy people from developed countries to feel good about themselves while not really making a difference. It can also be a way for individuals to gain career and personal benefits. On the other hand, volunteering can be a genuine way to provide technical assistance and make a positive impact. It can also help raise awareness about the causes of poverty and inequality.

D. Volunteer tourism can fit with people's desire to help others. It seems like a positive and attractive way to make a difference, especially in a time when people are skeptical of big government and big business. However, it can also avoid addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality. Some people might view volunteer tourism as a way to work around these issues rather than tackling them head-on.

""Choosing a Good Clock Radio

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios. We found that some had useful features, but others were not so good.

One clock radio had a ""dual alarm function"" that allowed you to set two different wake-up times. However, the instruction booklet advised using this feature to set different times for weekdays and weekends, which seemed unnecessary. This model was also quite expensive, but it did have a built-in cassette player, which was a nice feature.

We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but the clock was quite big. Paul Bridges said that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, and phone.

We tested five clock radios and chose the best one. It had a digital display with a nice design and a wide snooze bar. The clock also had a self-power backup, so you didn't need to reset it if the power went out. However, setting it up was a bit tricky.

Tom Granger thought the design of this clock radio was tacky and the light was hard to position. Paul Bridges liked the idea of the built-in lamp, but found the radio hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and made him feel like he was on a submarine.

We also tested a simple and cheap clock radio that scored points with Tom because it was easy to set up and took up little space. However, it had old-fashioned dial tuning, which he preferred. The radio quality was good, but the tuning was a bit crude.

In the end, we chose the best clock radio based on its features and design. It was a bit tricky to set up, but it was worth it.""

'Hedgehogs are small mammals covered in sharp spines. They can be found in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs have a special way of defending themselves by rolling into a ball when they feel threatened. This works well if they have a lot of spines. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines and are more likely to try to run away from danger. They use their rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep a lot during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them choose to do so. Some stay awake all year round if the conditions are suitable.'

""Women in Sports: Breaking Barriers

It's not easy to be a top athlete, but women have to work even harder. They have to balance their training and competitions with their personal lives, which can be difficult. Despite these challenges, many women are achieving great things in their sports. Here are some inspiring stories of six British women who are making a name for themselves.

Jill, a 27-year-old skier, loves the feeling of flying down the slopes, but it's not without its risks. ""It's scary sometimes,"" she says. ""But I get on with it."" She has to give up a lot of her social life and friends to train for 10 months a year.

Caroline, a 22-year-old cyclist, started racing two years ago. She won a charity race and realized she was good at it. ""I'm well paid now, but I worry that people think I'm successful because of how I look, not because I'm a good cyclist."" She trains for four hours a day and has to make sacrifices, but it's worth it.

Annabel, a 26-year-old rower, found it hard to get into the sport because few girls' schools offer it. She started late and had to work hard to catch up. ""Rowing is great fun, and I love being fit,"" she says. ""And there's a good social life.""

Ffyona, a 24-year-old long-distance walker, has always loved walking. She walked around the world and set a record. ""It was the hardest experience of my life,"" she says. ""But I did it.""

Lisa, a 26-year-old saloon car racer, faces challenges on the track and off. ""Some men think I'm not as good as them, so they try to beat me,"" she says. ""But I'm determined to succeed.""

Alison, a 28-year-old triathlete, trains hard every day. She swims, cycles, and runs. ""It's not easy, but it's worth it,"" she says. ""I'm happier when I'm fit, and I love the social side of racing.""

These women are breaking barriers and achieving their goals. They're showing that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.""

I met Picasso when I was 18 years old and had just finished school. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco with a friend in a old van. We didn't have much money, so I took a job painting boats on the waterfront in Cannes. One day, I was sitting at a café when I saw Picasso eating lunch with his wife and some friends. I was surprised because I had heard he was a reclusive person who didn't like to be seen in public. I decided to approach him and ask for his autograph. To my surprise, he agreed and even drew a picture on my sketchbook.

I was so grateful that I decided to ask him if I could draw his portrait. He agreed, and we sat down at his table. He started acting out different expressions, making it difficult for me to draw him. But I persisted, and eventually he relaxed and let me study his face. I was struck by his youthful appearance, despite being 84 years old. His eyes were very intense and seemed to be looking at something in the distance. He was also very private and seemed to be lost in thought, even though he was surrounded by people.

After I finished drawing, Picasso looked at my work and then took the crayon from me. He quickly drew a portrait of me, which was very different from what I had drawn of him. He added a few quick strokes and handed the sketchbook back to me. I was amazed at how easily he had captured my likeness. I thanked him and asked if I could keep the drawing, but he said it was already signed. I was grateful for the experience and the opportunity to meet Picasso.

**Selling Tricks in Shops**

Have you ever walked into a store and left with more than you intended to buy? Many shops use clever tricks to make you spend more. Here are some of their secrets:

**Fresh and Attractive**

Supermarkets know that people like fresh food, so they put it at the entrance of the store. They also use bright colors and nice smells to make you want to buy more. For example, they might have a bakery that smells like freshly baked bread.

**Displaying Products**

The way products are displayed is very important. Shops use computers to see which products are most popular and put them in easy-to-reach places. They also put higher-priced items in these areas to make more money.

**Making You Spend**

Some shops put low-priced items in hard-to-reach places, so you have to pass by more expensive items to get to them. This is a way to make you spend more money. Others put their most popular items far from the entrance, so you have to walk around the store and see other things before you get to them.

**Presentation Matters**

Some shops, like Next, make their products look exclusive by displaying only a few items at a time. This makes you feel like you're getting something special.

**Pricing and Promotions**

Shops use different prices to make you buy more. They might sell some items at a low price to attract you into the store, then sell you other items at a higher price. They also use promotions, like ""buy one, get one free,"" to make you buy more.

**Lighting and Layout**

Shops use lighting to make their products look good. They also use different flooring to guide you through the store and make you walk past other products.

**In-Store Promotions**

Some shops use big pictures or videos to make you want to buy certain products. They might also use special screens in trolleys to show you ads as you shop.

These are just a few of the tricks shops use to make you spend more. Next time you go shopping, see if you can spot some of these tactics!<|eot_id|>"

Chris Bonnington is a famous mountaineer who climbed Mount Everest in 1985. He also explored new routes in the British mountains and Alps and wrote several books. Robin Knox-Johnston is a sailor who sailed solo around the world in 1968-1969. He broke the transatlantic record and won many awards.

Chris and Robin became friends after Chris asked Robin for an interview for his book about adventure. They decided to go on a sailing and climbing trip to Greenland together. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness while climbing and his ability to make decisions. Robin was a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the boat's engine and toilet.

Chris found the sailing part of the trip boring and difficult, as he is a land lover. Robin, on the other hand, loved the sea and was good at fixing things. The two men had to work together to navigate the boat through ice and climb mountains. Chris was responsible for Robin's safety, which was a big responsibility.

The highlight of the trip was climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral. It was a challenging climb, and Chris was impressed by Robin's determination and willingness to learn. There were some tense moments, but they worked well together and supported each other.

The only time they had a disagreement was when Robin didn't wake Chris for his watch on the boat. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him that it was just a mistake. By the end of the trip, Chris realized that Robin was a kind and sensitive person beneath his tough exterior.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B2 level learner:

Apples have been around for thousands of years. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colours. However, the last century is in danger of losing this heritage.

Prehistoric humans ate apples 8,000 years ago. They threw away apple seeds in Britain and left apple remains around their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland, people even dried apple halves for winter. These were small, wild apples that were different from the apples we know today.

The Romans taught the French how to grow fruit, and they took this knowledge to Britain. The British monks developed new apples and introduced the dessert apple, Decio. Most Roman apples didn't grow well in Britain, so the Norman apples became popular.

In the 13th century, several types of apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple that was sold in Oxford markets. However, the country faced droughts, the Black Death, and wars, which reduced apple production and increased imports.

In the 16th century, Henry VIII ordered his chief fruit supplier to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. The supplier returned with new grafts, including the famous Pippins, and grew the first modern orchard in Kent.

Apples became popular in Britain, and settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America.

In the 17th century, John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple seedlings from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was known for his kindness to animals and his religious devotion.

In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer discovered a new apple variety, which he named 'Hawkey'. The apple became popular and was introduced as the 'Delicious' apple. Another famous apple was discovered by Maria Anne Smith, who found a small tree growing in a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and harvested the first major crop of green apples.

Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most commercial apples come from just a few varieties. There is a danger of losing the diversity of apples, as many old varieties have been lost. However, consumers are starting to demand more variety, and it is important to protect the natural diversity of apples for the benefit of all.

Richard Nerurkar, a top 10,000-metre runner from Britain, visited the Kenyan high-altitude training camp. The camp is located on the slope of Mount Kenya, the second-highest mountain in Africa. Richard had been training in Kenya for three years, but this was his first time training with Kenyan runners on their home soil. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000-metre race.

Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity. This has been proven by the success of many Kenyan runners. Richard's first race in Kenya was also a historic event - the first international cross-country race to be held on African soil.

Richard noticed that Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport. They have a relaxed attitude, a simple diet, and seem to enjoy competing. However, the most important factor in their success is their training regime. The national team training camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the mountain. The athletes live in basic dormitories and have a strict daily routine. They run three times a day, with a total distance of around 40 kilometres. On Sundays, they have a shorter run of 20 kilometres.

Life at the camp is uncomplicated. They have a simple breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and spend their free time relaxing or running. In the evenings, they take a bath in a nearby stream. Richard left the camp with a new appreciation for Kenyan success, which he believes cannot be attributed to genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. He thinks that the simplicity of the mountain lifestyle, the gruelling training, and the passion for success are the secrets behind Kenya's success in distance running.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2 on the CEFR:

Advertising is not as effective as it used to be. The problem is not just the economic recession, but the fact that advertising has not kept up with changes in the way people consume and make purchasing decisions. Advertisers often focus on mass markets and media, but with so many brands and products available, target audiences have become more fragmented. As a result, even big brands rarely target the right people.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30-50 items, but most of these will not be advertised brands. In fact, you probably only buy a few hundred different brands in a year. This is because most people don't buy many different products, and they rarely buy advertised brands.

According to a report, there are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised, but most people only buy a few hundred of these. In fact, the average person buys only 4% of the advertised brands. This means that 96% of all advertising is wasted, because it is not targeting the right people.

When you watch TV, you might see a few commercials for brands you buy or might buy in the future. But most commercials are for brands you don't buy or won't buy. This is because people are not easily swayed by advertising, and most of it is ignored.

Despite the waste, advertising can still be effective. It is a cheap way to reach a large number of people, and it can be targeted to reach the right people. However, advertisers need to be more precise in their targeting to make the most of their advertising budget.

'Charles Clover visits a unique home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which is considered the most environmentally-friendly house in Britain. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale, who are architects at Nottingham University. The house is special because it uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost, and heats itself using waste heat from appliances and the body heat of the family and their two cats.

The house looks like a traditional home, with a clay-tiled roof and burnt-orange brick walls, which was designed to fit in with the local architecture. When you enter the house, you notice that it is very quiet because of the super-insulated walls and krypton-filled windows. The house is also designed to be very efficient, with clever ventilation systems and air-locked doors to prevent heat loss.

The Vales have been interested in sustainable architecture for a long time and wrote a book on the subject in the 1970s. They designed the house to produce no carbon dioxide emissions and to use minimal resources. They even designed their own composting toilets and rainwater collection system.

The house is very energy-efficient and uses only 9 units of electricity per day, which is much less than the average four-bedroom house. The Vales are planning to install solar panels and a generator to produce even more electricity and eventually power an electric car.

The house is also designed to be warm in the winter, with a small wood-burning stove in the hall that is only used on extremely cold nights. The Vales claim that the house is comfortable at a temperature of 18°C, which is lower than usual, because of the lack of draughts and radiant heat loss.

The house was built using local materials and craftsmen, which made it affordable and low-tech. The Vales hope that their design will inspire others to build sustainable homes that are good for the environment.'

Blacksmiths have always been important craftsmen. For centuries, they have made things like weapons, tools, and even beautiful decorations. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected, even more than doctors and astrologers. They were the only ones who could make these important items.

In the past, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for famous buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. They also made intricate metalwork for French and Belgian architecture. However, by the 1960s, blacksmiths were no longer needed because machines could do their work more quickly and cheaply. As a result, the art of blacksmithing almost disappeared.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in decorative architecture and interior design, which has led to a revival of blacksmithing. Many blacksmiths are now creating beautiful and unique pieces of art. The British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is hosting an exhibition to promote the craft. The exhibition features over 250 pieces of ironwork, including bookends, a spiral staircase, and more. The prices range from £90 to over £1,000.

Blacksmiths are no longer limited by traditional techniques and can now use power tools to shape and mold the metal. This has given them the freedom to express themselves creatively. One blacksmith, Alan Dawson, says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because people and blacksmiths have had their eyes opened to the possibilities.""

Many blacksmiths are fascinated by iron because it is a challenging material to work with. It is soft when hot, but hard and rigid when cold. Susan May, a jeweller, says, ""It's magical because it's soft when hot, but becomes really rigid and unmovable when it cools down."" Another blacksmith, Ann Catrin Evans, says, ""I love the fact that steel is cold and hard, and the way it feels like it's there forever.""

Iron has the potential to be used decoratively for many years to come, as long as we don't have to look at too many rusty candlesticks!<|eot_id|>"

""I QUIT SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. 'Why did you stop now and not earlier?' she asked. I couldn't explain how I suddenly stopped smoking after being a heavy smoker for years. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnosis. I didn't want to stop smoking and I didn't even think about it. I had low blood pressure and a healthy family, and I didn't get sick easily. I went to the session to write an article about other people who were trying to quit. I told the counsellor I wouldn't try to stop, as my motivation was to write the article, not to quit. The session was unusual - we were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was filled with smoke. But I noticed that when we were told to smoke, I didn't want to - and neither did the others. I think what happened was that the idea of quitting made sense to me intellectually. Quitting smoking became a challenge, and the thought of not being a smoker made me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that was just between me and myself. Quitting was easy. The physical cravings went away after a few days, and I didn't have any problems with my work. The only difficult thing was pottering around at home on weekends, which I still find hard. I think I used to smoke to fill my time, and now I have to find new things to do. I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel prize. She should be a well-known figure in Britain, but many people don't know about her. I've been asking friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them haven't heard of her.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a remarkable person who worked in a field that was not well-known to the general public. Her life reflects some of the most important events of the 20th century, such as the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.

When I started researching her life, I found that there were few biographies about her. I also discovered that many scientists don't think their lives are interesting enough to be written about. They think that their work is too complicated and technical for the general public to understand.

However, some scientists are now trying to change this. They are writing books about their lives and experiences, and they are appearing on TV and radio shows. This is helping to make scientists more relatable and human.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a devoted scientist who worked hard to solve complex problems. She won the Nobel prize for her work on the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12. She also had a personal life, with three children and a husband who was a historian. Her ability to balance her work and personal life is something that many people can learn from.

However, communicating scientific ideas to the general public is a difficult task. Scientists need to find a way to explain their work in a way that is easy to understand. This is not just about explaining complex ideas, but also about conveying the passion and excitement of scientific discovery.

It is sad that many people are not familiar with the work of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. She was a remarkable person who made important contributions to science, and her life is worth learning about.<|eot_id|>"

Hakan Hardenberger is a world-renowned trumpet player. Despite coming from a non-musical family, he has achieved great success at a young age. His parents, who didn't know much about music, bought him a trumpet as a Christmas gift when he was eight. The gift was a surprise hit, and Hakan never stopped playing. His mother managed to get him lessons with a professional trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson. Nilsson recognized Hakan's natural talent and helped him develop his skills.

Hardenberger believes that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and that it's all about finding the right relationship with its imperfections. He has always been a solo artist, and his role model was the French trumpeter Maurice Andre. Hakan's parents supported his ambition to become a professional trumpet player, and he eventually studied in Paris with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud encouraged Hakan to enter a competition, which he won, and he realized that he had a special gift for communicating with his audience.

**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**What Makes a Good Leader?**

A leader is someone who inspires and motivates others. It's not about being tall or smart. A good leader shows the way forward and makes things happen through enthusiastic and interested people. To be a good leader, you need to be able to speak clearly and confidently, and make decisions with conviction.

**Everyone Can Be a Leader**

Most people have the potential to be leaders, but they may not recognize it. To become a leader, you need to develop your skills and use them. We all have the ability to lead, but we need the right circumstances to do so.

**The Difference Between Leaders and Managers**

Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path. A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a company. Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills.

**Tips for Becoming a Better Leader**

* Find your passions and convictions and act on them.
* Think of yourself as a leader and recognize your abilities.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from your mistakes.
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but don't feel like you need to lead all the time.

**Films on Video**

Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases.

A. **The Abyss**
This film is about oil riggers and navy experts who try to rescue a submarine that's stuck underwater. The director, James Cameron, made this movie before he made **Titanic**. The film is a thriller and has a lot of action. The characters are brave and have a sense of humor, like the heroes in movies by director Howard Hawks. The special effects and production design are impressive. However, the dialogue and character development are not as good.

B. **The Thin Red Line**
This film is based on a novel by James Jones and is about a battle in World War II. The director, Andrew Marton, made a more traditional war movie than the director of the newer version, Terrence Malick. Marton's film is more faithful to the book and focuses on a single soldier and his relationship with his sergeant. While Malick's film is more poetic and complex, Marton's version has its own moments. One memorable scene is a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.

C. **On Guard**
This film is a swashbuckling adventure set in the 18th century. It's loosely based on a novel by Paul Feval. The film has a good villain and a hero who is brave and fun to watch. The film-makers use costume drama clichés, but they do it in a way that's entertaining. The film is a bit corny, but it's enjoyable.

D. **Character**
This film is a drama set in the early 20th century in Rotterdam. The production design and costumes are very detailed, but the film is a bit slow and serious. The main character is a cruel bailiff who is mean to his tenants. The film focuses on his relationship with his son, but the story is not as strong as it could be.

E. **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This classic Western film has been re-released on video. The sound effects are impressive, and the music is great. The story is violent and intense, and the characters are all morally ambiguous.

F. **The Longest Day**
This war epic has a big cast of stars and was directed by four different directors. The film is about the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II. The early parts of the film are a bit slow, but the action scenes are impressive. The film is better suited to the big screen, but it's still enjoyable on video.

BOOK A Steve Martin's Compelling Evidence is a great book. The main character is a lawyer who has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial is exciting and you're not sure what will happen until the end. This is a great debut book in a popular genre.

BOOK B Curtains for the Cardinal is a thrilling book that takes place in the Italian Renaissance. The main character, Sigismondo, is a troubleshooter for the aristocracy and gets caught up in a complicated web of politics, intrigue, and murder. Although the book is a bit too long, it's still very engaging.

BOOK C File Under: Deceased introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, a tax inspector who becomes involved in a murder investigation. Leah is a strong and determined character who is not afraid to take risks.

BOOK D Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker is a classic detective story about a private investigator named Spenser who helps his friend Hawk to clean up a troubled neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is fast-paced and witty, and there's more philosophy than usual in this book.

BOOK E False Prophet by Faye Kellermann features a pair of detectives investigating a burglary at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's writing style is easy to follow and the characters are interesting.

BOOK F Husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock wrote Blood Red, Snow White, a suspense novel about a lawyer who defends a client accused of murder. The story is full of romance, money, and violence, and it's hard to put down.

BOOK G Dead for a Ducat by Simon Shaw is a comedy about an actor named Philip Fletcher who is supposed to star in a movie about Robin Hood. However, things don't go as planned and Philip becomes the target of a series of mishaps.

BOOK H Fall Down Easy by Lawrence Gough is a detective novel about a bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The book builds up slowly and the portrayal of the robber is very well done, making it a standout in the genre.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

Tim Pozzi, a 34-year-old man, has decided to leave his job and go backpacking. He's thinking about why he and others his age are making this choice. I'm 34 years old and I've decided to leave my job to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm nervous. I've traveled before, but this time I'm doing it alone.

I used to work and had a steady income, but I realized I was sacrificing my happiness for money. When I quit my job, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. Many of my friends are married with children and they're jealous of my freedom. I'm not in a relationship and I don't have big career goals. I feel like I should make the most of my freedom, even if it's just for my friends' sake.

I'm worried about making arrangements, like finding someone to rent my flat and organizing my trip. I've also been putting it off because I'm not sure if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among young backpackers?

Many people in their late 20s and 30s are taking a break from their normal lives to travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that people are realizing that adventure is available to them whenever they want. They just need to be brave enough and organized enough to take the chance.

Danny and his girlfriend Tammy are taking a year off to travel around the world. They're willing to give up job security to have this experience. Matt, who used to be in the Army, traveled for a year and it helped him change his perspective.

There are many reasons why people are traveling at this stage of their lives. Some are taking a break from work, while others are looking for a change. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says that more people are working on short-term contracts, so they have more freedom to travel. Some companies are even offering career breaks.

Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, says that many people in their 30s are reassessing their lives and looking for a change. Travel offers a chance to take a step back and think about what they want. Is giving up the comfort of a steady job and a routine just a sign of our generation's inability to grow up? Jennifer Cox doesn't think so. She says it's a sign of a more educated and stable society that people are taking the time to ask if this is what they really want.

Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is heading to Central America for a year. He doesn't think he's running away from anything, but rather towards something. He's excited about the adventure, but also worried about leaving behind his comfortable routine.

I share Ben's concerns about leaving behind a predictable life with few challenges. I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't had a bad boss. As Jennifer Cox points out, often there's a catalyst, like a break-up or a job loss, that pushes people to take the leap. Whatever the outcome, I'll be happy to have taken the chance and grabbed life by the horns.<|eot_id|>"

I decided to leave my job as a journalist for a few years to focus on my family. But when I turned 37, I realized that I needed to get back to work. I looked at my CV and saw that I was stuck in the past - I didn't know how to use a computer. Most job ads asked for experience with desktop publishing, which I didn't have. I felt like I was at a disadvantage.

I was a bit of a technophobe - even using a pocket calculator was a challenge for me. But I knew I had to learn. So, I entered a competition and won a computer package, which included a laptop and a personal computer for my family. We started using the computer and soon we were chatting with people all over the world via the internet. My children were already familiar with computers from school, but I was more hesitant. I was worried that I would make a mistake and lose all my work.

However, I persevered and learned the basic skills I needed. I even started freelancing for a magazine and writing two articles a month. I was able to work from home and take care of my children at the same time. The computer has been a game-changer for me. It's helped me stay organized and efficient, and I can now research stories and communicate with other journalists easily.

Working from home has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, I can be isolated from human contact and there are distractions at home. On the other hand, I have more time with my family and can work at my own pace. There are many people like me who have started working from home and it's becoming a growing trend. According to a report, most people who work from home are well-educated and have a computer and other technology at their disposal. I'm one of the lucky ones who has made the transition successfully.

'The National Museum of Scotland is a modern building in the historic city of Edinburgh. The building's unique design has been praised by some, but others have been less impressed. Now that the museum is almost ready to open, it's time to see what's inside. The museum tells the story of Scotland's history through a collection of precious objects. The exhibits are arranged in a way that helps visitors understand the timeline of events, but doesn't overwhelm them with too much information. The museum's goal is to make the visit a pleasant and engaging experience for everyone, not just experts. The head of exhibitions, Dr. David Clarke, believes that the museum should show the truth about the past, without using mock-ups or reconstructions. This means that what you see is what the experts know.

The museum has a unique layout, with galleries of different sizes and shapes. The walls are made to look like stone, and there are windows that let in natural light. The museum also has a special area for children, called the Discovery Centre, where they can learn and have fun. The museum's top floor is dedicated to the 20th century, with objects that have had a big impact on Scottish life. The Prime Minister even suggested an electric guitar as one of the items to be included! Overall, the museum's goal is to make history come alive through the objects on display. The building's modern design works well from the inside, but some people may still have mixed feelings about its location.'

""The end of print newspapers may take some time. Some people might find the idea of change frightening or challenging, but transition means moving from one place to another in a smooth and gradual way. However, the transition of newspapers to the online world is a different story. It's an uncertain and uncomfortable process because it may not happen at all. Many people think it will happen eventually because newspaper sales are decreasing while website visits are increasing. But there are some things that don't quite fit this picture.

For example, although newspaper sales are down, the number of people reading news and current affairs magazines is increasing. In fact, some magazines have seen a 5.4% rise in sales. The same is true for books. Although e-readers are popular, the value of physical books sold has only decreased by 0.4%. It seems that people are reading both on screens and on paper.

Some people think that young people have abandoned newspaper reading, but the latest figures show that nearly 5 million people between 15 and 35 still read the main national dailies. Different countries have different stories to tell. In Britain, newspaper sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany and France, the decline has been much smaller.

The media analysts used to think that online advertising would pay for the change and make online newspapers successful. However, this is not happening. Many newspapers have put up paywalls, and the best way to attract paying readers is to offer both print and digital access together. Print advertising is also much more valuable than online advertising, raising between nine and ten times more money. This means that newspaper companies have to maintain both a print and digital presence, which is difficult, complex, and expensive. Despite this, newspaper brands still have a strong reputation in print, and it's harder to be noticed online.""

**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. They can make a picture more engaging than a scene without people. However, photographing people can be challenging because you need to consider many factors, such as their actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of the camera can also affect how they behave.

**Taking Group Photos**

When taking a group photo, avoid straight lines. Instead, ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also ask some to sit or kneel in the front so that everyone's face is visible.

**Posing for Pictures**

People often don't act naturally in front of a camera. They might stiffen up and look unnatural. To relax your subject, suggest a comfortable position, such as folding their arms or putting their hands in their pockets.

**The Right Approach**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can create tension and make people feel uncomfortable. Most people will agree to have their picture taken and are usually flattered by it. However, they might feel self-conscious and need direction.

**Eye Contact**

A picture becomes more interesting if the subject looks directly at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, not necessarily to smile. This will create a natural expression.

**Candid Concentration**

An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can be easier for them and make the viewer feel like they are observing the scene unnoticed.

**Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures can tell us more about the subject than anything else. Look for familiar expressions, such as smiles, winks, or tears, which can convey emotions and create a connection with the viewer.

**Situational Interest**

The background or environment of a photo can add interest and information about the subject. Try to exclude unnecessary details and blur them if necessary. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.

**Interaction**

Photos of people interacting with each other, such as talking, laughing, or working together, can be very engaging. Look for contact between the subjects, such as eye contact or physical contact.

**People and Places**

Many photos of people are taken during outings or holidays. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to capture the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so that they form a foreground interest without obscuring the background.

**To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear photo to remember someone, you may want to ask them to pose against a well-chosen background. However, candid photos of events as they happen can be more lively and memorable.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

Sarah's work is in high demand, and she's worked on many big projects, including a ceiling in a castle. She's very humble and doesn't like to brag about her skills. She thinks that art should speak for itself, and she's happy to let her work do the talking.

Sarah's trompe-l'oeil paintings are often inspired by architecture or designed for specific spaces. She loves working with clients and coming up with ideas together. She believes that trompe-l'oeil should be personal and engaging, and she's always looking for ways to make it more interesting.

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**

The way we work is changing. We are no longer judged only on our intelligence, skills, and qualifications. Now, our ability to work well with others and handle ourselves is also important. This is especially true when choosing who to hire or promote. The new rules focus on personal qualities like initiative, empathy, and persuasiveness - what we call emotional intelligence.

In today's job market, where job security is uncertain, personal qualities play a big role. We need to be able to work well with others and manage our own emotions to be successful. Emotional intelligence includes being aware of our own feelings and those of others, regulating our emotions, and using them to make good decisions.

Some people think emotional intelligence means being nice all the time, but it's not always about being nice. It's about knowing when to be direct and honest, and when to be kind. It's also about managing our emotions so we can work effectively with others.

More and more companies are recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence in their employees. In fact, it's essential for success in many jobs, especially those that require teamwork and customer service. Emotional intelligence can be developed over time, and it's an important part of personal growth and maturity.

Emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success, but it's an important ingredient. If we ignore it, other aspects of our work may not work as well as they could.

Reporters now use social media to get images quickly. However, some journalists use photos and videos from the public without asking permission. There's a debate about whether this is right. Research shows that many people would take photos or videos of a news event. This means that photos and videos from the public will be important in the future of news.

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice that is over 2,000 years old. It is based on the idea that the body has a flow of energy, or Qi, that needs to be balanced for good health. Practitioners believe that when the flow of Qi is blocked or imbalanced, it can cause illness or pain.

During a consultation, an acupuncturist will examine your pulse, tongue, and overall appearance, and ask about your medical history, lifestyle, and state of mind. They will then insert fine needles into specific points on the body to stimulate the flow of Qi and restore balance.

There are over 300 points on the body that can be used for acupuncture, and the points are related to specific energy pathways, or meridians. People often report a gentle, tingling sensation when the needles are inserted, which is a sign that the Qi is flowing properly.

While some doctors in the West may not fully understand the traditional Chinese theory behind acupuncture, many have found that it can be effective for pain relief. Some scientists believe that acupuncture works by blocking pain signals to the brain or releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals.

Acupuncture is used to treat a range of conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is often used as a last resort for people with chronic pain, and can be especially helpful for those who have not found relief with other treatments.

In recent years, acupuncture has been used as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery, particularly in China. This has helped to increase its acceptance among Western doctors. While some people may be hesitant to try acupuncture, it is generally considered safe and can be an effective way to manage pain.

As with any complementary therapy, it can be difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture through clinical trials. However, many people report that it works well for them, and acupuncturists generally quote a success rate of 50-80%.

Overall, acupuncture is a holistic approach to health that views the body as a whole, rather than just focusing on specific symptoms. It can be a valuable addition to traditional Western medicine, and can help people find relief from chronic pain.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level B2:

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. She is known for her clever and complex stories. People often think she would be a good headmistress of a girls' school because she seems so confident. But she is actually shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is based on herself, but if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes on his own, just like his creator. P.D. James likes to work alone when she writes. She can write anywhere as long as she has privacy.

P.D. James is very modest about her success. She doesn't think she is the best crime writer in Britain, even though millions of people all over the world read her books. She likes the books of her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James also likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively. She also enjoys books by men like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, who she thinks were great writers.

P.D. James didn't become famous until later in life. When she was 42, her first crime novel was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11. She met her husband at the university and always loved the place. That's why she chose it as the setting for one of her books.

P.D. James had a difficult life. Her husband came back from the war sick, and she had to work long hours to support their two daughters. She didn't have time to write, but she used her organizational skills to work in administration for the National Health Service. She even managed five psychiatric outpatients' clinics and worked in the Police Department and the Home Office. She became used to seeing dead bodies, but it wasn't the death itself that inspired her. It was the way a crime novel is structured that appealed to her. She always enjoyed reading detective stories and wanted to be a writer. Writing detective stories is a way of bringing order to chaos. It shows that life is still valuable, even if it's not perfect. Nobody likes violence.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2 on the CEFR:

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is becoming more popular. In some countries, employers ask job applicants to write a sample of their handwriting. This can help decide whether they are suitable for the job. Researchers believe that handwriting can reveal a person's character, health, and even psychological state. For example, it can show if someone has heart disease or cancer. Handwriting analysis is used to help with job interviews and to find the right person for a job.

Some companies employ graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential employees. These experts can tell a lot about a person's personality, such as whether they are honest, reliable, or devious. They can also detect signs of mental health problems, like depression or anxiety.

Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes that handwriting is a powerful tool. She says it can reveal a person's social class, intelligence, and even their potential. She claims that handwriting can show whether someone is likely to be successful in arts or sciences, or if they have a troubled past.

Graphology can also be used to detect criminal tendencies. According to Marne, criminals often have poor handwriting and may have arrested emotional development. She says that graphologists can even predict whether someone is about to commit a crime or has suicidal tendencies.

However, not all experts agree with Marne's claims. Some psychiatrists think that handwriting is just a product of education and artistic ability, and has no deeper meaning.

'A happy and healthy workforce starts with a good office environment. We visited four different offices to see how they compare. Our experts included a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here's what they thought:

Office A: This office is quite basic. There's no central heating or air conditioning, and the windows open straight onto the street. But the people who work here are a close-knit team and seem happy. They make adjustments to the temperature and lighting themselves, just like they would at home.

Ergonomist: The furniture is a bit of a mix. Some of it is not very good for working, and many chairs are old and broken. However, the people here have a varied work schedule, which helps prevent boredom and fatigue.

Occupational Psychologist: The staff love the variety of work and the flexibility of the office space. They said it's just the right size - small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but big enough to have some alone time.

Office B: This office is comfortable and well-maintained. The air is good, and there's no smoking allowed. The furniture is good quality, and the space is well-planned. However, it's a bit impersonal and lacks stimulation.

Ergonomist: The chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. However, the layout could be improved, and the walls are bare.

Occupational Psychologist: The staff are generally happy, and relationships are good. However, the office could be improved with more decorations and ways to share information.

Office C: This office is a bit mixed. It feels like a showcase, with many similar offices nearby. Despite the mix of smokers and non-smokers, the air is good. The furniture is adequate, but not inspiring.

Ergonomist: The desks are okay, but not great. The chairs are not all suitable for computer work, and the computer screens are not set up well.

Occupational Psychologist: The staff are supportive and well-equipped with technology. There are many awards on display, and the wood panelling and carpet give a serious tone. The office is busy and active.

Office D: This office is not very good. The air conditioning is poor, and the space is cluttered and dusty. The furniture is old and not suitable for computer work.

Ergonomist: The furniture is not suitable for a modern office. Many chairs are old and uncomfortable, and the desks are not well-designed.

Occupational Psychologist: The office is dirty and needs a good clean. There's no recognition of individual achievements, and the air conditioning is not good. The staff seem stressed and focused on meeting deadlines.'

'Chewing Gum: A Global Phenomenon

Chewing gum is a popular habit that has been around for thousands of years. In ancient times, people chewed on tree resin to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Today, Americans alone chew 12 million sticks of gum every day.

Chewing gum is a food, so it must meet certain standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration. Most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resin and softeners to give it a pleasant taste and texture.

The history of chewing gum dates back to ancient Greece, where people chewed on a resin from the mastic tree. In North America, early colonists chewed on resin that formed on spruce trees. Later, in the 1800s, chewing gum became a commercial product in the United States.

In the late 1800s, a new type of gum was discovered in Central America, made from the sap of the sapodilla tree. This gum was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, and it quickly became popular. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have been unsuccessful.

Today, most chewing gum is made from synthetic materials, as the demand for natural chicle has decreased. The few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, face many challenges, including poisonous snakes and insects, to collect the sap.

Despite the challenges, the chewing gum industry continues to grow, with manufacturers finding new ways to market their products. Some claim that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay, and research is ongoing to develop new textures and flavors.

In the United States, a significant amount of land is dedicated to growing mint, which is used in many popular chewing gums.'

The Hotel Inspector, Sue Brown, checks hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. As soon as she arrived, she noticed some problems. The receptionist was not paying attention to a potential guest and didn't even acknowledge them. Sue thought this was a bad start.

The hotel had three red stars, which means it was one of the best 130 out of 4,000 hotels in the guide. However, the entrance was not what Sue expected. There was no one to help her get in, and the corridor was long and empty. When she arrived at the reception, the staff didn't have her booking information.

Sue found some other problems, such as a room that was too hot and had a hole in the wall. The next morning, she met the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, and told him about her findings. He apologized for the mistakes and promised to fix them. Sue suggested that the hotel should improve the way they welcome guests and make sure the rooms are ready.

Although Sue found some negative things, she also praised some staff members, like Emma and Trudy, who were helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel's food was also good, which helped keep its two-rosette rating. Sue told Greaves that the hotel could get three rosettes if it improved its service and food.

As the hotel inspector, Sue's job is to tell the truth, even if it's hard. She has to write a report about her findings and give it to the hotel manager. The hotel pays to be included in the guide, but it's worth it because it helps them improve. Sue is not going to take away the hotel's red stars, but another inspector will come back to make sure everything is fixed.

**The Seven Summits**

I, Doug Scott, have climbed the highest mountain on each continent. This is my story of adventure and perseverance.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**

My climbing partner, Dougal Haston, and I were on the summit ridge when we started talking about sleeping bags. I thought it was strange, as we were alone. Later, I found myself talking to my feet because of the cold. We were worried about the quality of our survival, not just the survival itself. After two days, I realized I couldn't have chosen a better climbing partner than Dougal. We reached the summit, and I felt confident that everything would work out.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**

This mountain is known for being the most treacherous. Dougal and I arrived at the base of the mountain and spent four days climbing to the top. We decided to climb 'alpine style', carrying all our gear and food with us. We climbed up a snowy slope to camp under a rocky cliff. The air pressure was lower than expected, making it feel like we were at a much higher altitude. We reached the summit and felt triumphant.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**

I was supposed to climb Mt. Kenya, but an unexpected offer took me to Kilimanjaro instead. We got lost in the jungle and had to find a rock pool with water. We tried to climb a direct route, but it was too difficult, so we took a different route to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**

My wife, Sharu, and I joined a guide, Phil Erscheler, to climb Aconcagua. We decided to take a different route to avoid the crowds. The wind was strong, and we had to hurry to reach the summit before dark.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**

Climbing Vinson Massif was a financial challenge, but it helped me realize my dream of climbing the Seven Summits. We traveled to Antarctica and climbed the mountain in extreme weather conditions. The air was clean and invigorating, and we reached the summit within 8 hours.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**

Our team assembled in St Petersburg and traveled to Elbrus. We took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to the refuge at 4,200m. The wind was strong, and we had to climb a long ridge to reach the actual summit.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**

We climbed Carstensz Pyramid to establish a new route and to spend time with the local Dani people. We were warned about potential dangers, but we were undeterred. We climbed the mountain, and I was given a standing ovation at the summit, my seventh and final summit.

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden, which surrounds her house, is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants are a bit wild and spread seeds all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path are very beautiful, with a mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is partly due to the previous owners, who were keen gardeners and left behind plants that Susan liked. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to paint individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She usually picks a flower, takes it to her studio, and paints it. Sometimes it takes a few days to finish one flower, and then she brings in another one to add to the painting. It can take a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is in the spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies bloom. She loves watching the flowers change and grow.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany at school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside. She didn't like garden flowers back then, but now she appreciates the beauty of plants from all over the world. Her garden is a mix of plants from different places, and she likes to let them grow freely. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for, it's been hard for her to find time to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows it's important to get her hands dirty to stay connected to her subject matter.

We had lived in our valley for 16 months when we realized the dangers that could affect us from the surrounding hills. The year was unusual, with storms arriving early, before winter even started. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley, sheltered by the hills. Suddenly, snow began to fall, covering the ground 15 centimeters deep. It blocked our lane and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But the snow was much deeper on the nearby hills, and the wind was strong. We felt only strong gusts of wind in our valley, but we knew there was a reason to worry. The river, the Ryburn, was a bigger concern. It normally flowed gently, but if the snow had not been controlled by dams, it could have caused problems. As the snow melted, we watched the clouds gathering over the hills. They were dark and twisted, warning us of what was to come. The river started to swell, and we watched it every day. The snow was washed away, and the rain poured down, filling the reservoir. It was almost full and about to overflow. Suddenly, the reservoir burst, and the water poured into the stream below. The river became wild, and the stream near our cottage was deeper than we had ever seen it. We were worried it would flood, but the dam held, and the water subsided. In the past, the river had flooded nearby villages, but now it's contained by the dam. We can enjoy the big clouds and the river's power without fear, knowing our home is safe.

My first job as a critic was at The Front Page, where I met Tom Seaton, the arts editor.

It was a dream come true to be part of a new newspaper. However, the team idea didn't work out, and we ended up working individually by phone.

I chose to focus on film criticism because it's what I enjoy most. I wouldn't want to review every film that comes out, as that would get boring. Instead, I write a weekly article on one film, which gives me the freedom to explore different themes and ideas. My role is not to tell people what to watch or not to watch.

**Why Do Some Teenagers Love Triathlons?**

Do you know why a schoolgirl would want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because it's fun! Melanie Sears, a 17-year-old athlete, loves triathlons. She is looking for a training partner, preferably a female, who is also passionate about distance running, swimming, and cycling.

Melanie started triathlons at 14 and has been training hard ever since. She says it's not just about the physical challenge, but also the fun of competing. ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end.""

Melanie has had some ups and downs in her triathlon career. She once entered the National Championships and finished nowhere, but she didn't give up. She has also had to overcome some mistakes, like going the wrong way during a race and having to cycle 20 kilometers extra.

Despite the challenges, Melanie is determined to keep going. She is already a top junior triathlete and is hoping to compete in the World Championships in New Zealand. She needs to buy a new bike to help her train and is trying to convince her parents to help her out.

However, her intense training schedule has made it difficult for her to have a social life. She doesn't have time for parties or hanging out with friends. Instead, she focuses on her training and talks to other athletes about their times and progress.

Melanie wants to keep pushing herself to new limits and is considering entering even tougher events than triathlons. She is looking for someone her age to train with, but so far, she hasn't found anyone.

Collecting is a popular hobby that many people enjoy. One in three adults collects something. I have been collecting things all my life. I started collecting stones and seashells as a child. I also collect flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was of stones I found in my parents' garden.

I was fascinated by the objects in the local museum when I visited it as a child. I was surprised to learn that many people share my interest in collecting. Some people collect because it's the only part of their life where they have complete control. For me, collecting is just something I enjoy doing.

Many famous people have collected things too. The Duc de Berry in France had a room full of unusual objects. Catherine the Great of Russia had a collection of over 4,000 paintings. But you don't have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I've collected all sorts of things, from tulip bulbs to china cups.

I once collected American rag dolls, and I searched all over the USA to find them. Unfortunately, my house caught fire and my collection was destroyed. It's the way collections change hands that fascinates me. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet can be very valuable. As certain objects become popular, their value increases.

Some old toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot of money, as long as you still have the original boxes and contents. I, unfortunately, threw mine away!

""My Work""

Lisa - Science Museum

I organize temporary exhibitions at the Science Museum. My job includes planning and designing the exhibition, and telling people about it. Before the exhibition, I read about the subject and talk to experts to understand the main ideas and goals. I make sure the public can understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays and activities. I also work with engineers to ensure the exhibition is safe for visitors. Before it opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to promote the exhibition.

Janet - London Taxi Driver School

I teach London taxi drivers. My day starts by checking the accounts and preparing new maps and documents for students to learn the routes. When students are in class, they work out the most direct route to pass the test. I help them when they disagree on a route, and sometimes I give them an alternative route because a road is closed. This helps them think critically.

Sarah - Marine Conservationist

I work from home near the coast, responding to phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes I go to our main office. I also work with schools and training centers, teaching coastal managers and decision-makers about the importance of marine conservation. I take them on boat trips to help them understand the impact of their decisions. It's a rewarding job, but my charity needs more funding, so I'm always looking for resources.

Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher

My job is varied. I make sure our publications meet customer needs and manage our stock of books. We have high standards for accuracy and content. We receive letters from readers about issues like map boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss projects and sales with co-publishers and work with a team that makes the job enjoyable. The downside is that there's too much administrative work, leaving less time for more interesting tasks.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make them easier to read

We always went to Ireland in June. For as long as we've been going on holidays together, we've spent the first two weeks at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house near the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes, but they've done it tastefully. Our friend Strafe found the house for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still looking for guests. We didn't like our previous holiday, so we were excited to try something new. The four of us - Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I - have been friends for a long time. We've been going on holidays together for ages. Dekko and Strafe were at school together, which is why we call Strafe by his surname. We're all around the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds used to live in England before they moved to Ireland. It's a coincidence that we all ended up at the same place.

When we arrived, Mrs Malseed was waiting for us in the big, low-ceilinged hall. It always smells of flowers in there. She asked Arthur, the porter, to take our luggage to our rooms. She calls the rooms by the names of flowers - Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mr Malseed came in from the kitchen and greeted us with a big smile and a warm welcome. He's a friendly man with dark brown eyes that twinkle. Everyone smiled, and we felt like our holiday had really started.

After dinner, we played cards for a bit, but we didn't stay up too late because we were still tired from our journey. There were other people in the lounge, including a man on his own and a French couple. We could see some of the other guests walking around the lawns or going down to the sea. The next day, we would walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee, and then go on a drive in the afternoon. This is what we usually do when we're at Glencorn Lodge.

Over the years, we've fallen in love with the beautiful landscape around here.<|eot_id|>"

A chalet girl's work is never done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, who works in Val d'Isere, France. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex. Sarah works for a company that provides chalets for people who come to ski. She cooks and cleans for the guests who stay in the chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and is using this job as a way to gain experience and make new friends before settling down.

Sarah wakes up at 7 am and walks to the chalet, where she prepares breakfast for the guests. She then cleans the rooms and prepares tea for the guests to help themselves. After that, she goes skiing as much as she can. Sarah usually returns to the chalet around 4:30 pm to prepare dinner. She serves dinner at 8 pm and then clears away the dishes.

Sarah meets her friends in the evening and they go out to bars and restaurants. On Sundays, Sarah has a busy day, as she needs to prepare breakfast for the guests who are leaving and then clean the chalet. She also does the shopping for the week and prepares tea for the new guests. In the evening, she might take the new guests to the ski shop to get their equipment and then go back to the chalet.

Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale girl who looked younger than Seymour's daughter Marie, came to his factory one day. She was wearing overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Despite her small size, she was a university student doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. Seymour sometimes helped students like Rita by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a brief tour of his factory.

Rita asked Seymour about his factory and the process of making gloves. He told her that his factory produces between 20,000 and 25,000 pieces per shipment. She was interested in every detail and asked about the tannery where they get the raw material. Seymour offered to take her to the tannery to see how the leather is made.

Rita had never seen anything being manufactured before, except for her mother making a cake when she was a child. Seymour was impressed by her eagerness to learn and her innocence. He thought she reminded him of his daughter Marie, who was tall and fair-haired, but had the same good-natured intelligence and enthusiasm for learning.

Seymour decided to show Rita the entire process of making gloves, from start to finish. He asked her what size she wore, and then offered to make a pair of gloves for her to watch being made.

In a lumberyard by a lake, there was an old building with soft sawdust piled up all around it. The sawdust was so high that it reached the lake. One afternoon, Michael and his friends decided to climb up to the roof of the old building. They sat down and looked out at the lake. Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down!' He jumped first and landed safely in the sawdust. His friends were hesitant at first, but eventually they all jumped down and laughed together. They spent the rest of the afternoon lying on the sawdust, telling jokes and having fun.

Later, one of Michael's friends suggested they jump down again. This time, Michael was the only one who didn't want to. He was scared and didn't know why. His friends teased him and called him a coward. Michael tried to convince himself to jump, but he couldn't. He stayed on the roof for a long time, feeling ashamed and alone. Eventually, he slipped off the roof and fell onto the sawdust. He lay there for a while, feeling sorry for himself.

When he got home, his stepmother was angry because he was late for dinner. She told him he was old enough to get home on time and that he should stay in if he didn't want to come home. Michael was still feeling sad and embarrassed, and he hardly heard his stepmother's words. He was still thinking about his friends and how they had laughed at him.

'Changing Your Job Are you unhappy in your job, but don't know how to change? Many people are in this situation. One solution is to see a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a short story about yourself and then take some tests. The results will show what jobs you might be good at and what training you might need. I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. The tests were like a science exam, but it wasn't about passing or failing. They asked me to do things like find mistakes in a list of names and numbers, and match shapes. Then I talked to an adviser and they gave me a report with their suggestions. I agreed with most of what they said, but I was surprised to find out that I didn't do well in the science and practical tests. It was good to know that I made the right decision about becoming a journalist. You don't have to change your career completely. Donna Laney, for example, was a marketing manager, but after losing her job, she went to Career Analysts and discovered she had a talent for design. She decided to use her existing skills and move into a new field. Juliet Greene, on the other hand, was unhappy in her job at a bank and went to Career Counselling Services. The tests showed she was interested in science, and after four sessions with an adviser, she decided to study geology. However, not everyone has the same experience. Amanda Margetts, a sales representative, didn't find the advice helpful because it didn't suggest anything new or different from what she already knew.'

'Fun at the Dentist's? W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in Glasgow's city centre is a pleasant surprise. The walls are decorated with modern paintings and the waiting area has a fashionable blue couch. Jerome says many people only visit the dentist when they're in pain, because they're afraid. He wants to change this. That's why his surgery has a relaxed atmosphere, with no white coats. He believes dental treatment should be enjoyable and relaxing. This is a big change from what most of us are used to.

Jerome uses special techniques to help his patients feel calm. One of these is virtual reality headsets. Patients wear them during their check-up and watch a film while Jerome examines their teeth. Many people enjoy this part of their visit. The surgery also has a pleasant smell, like a perfume shop. Jerome wants his patients to feel comfortable and relaxed from the moment they walk in.

Despite being known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome takes his work very seriously. He uses special instruments to clean teeth, which are gentle and painless. Jerome has also studied dental techniques in the US and believes that making patients feel comfortable makes it easier for the dentist too. He hopes his approach will change the way dentistry is done in the UK. When a patient arrives, Jerome offers them a cup of tea and helps them choose a video to watch before their treatment. The patient seems to be enjoying the experience, and it's easy to see why. The surgery feels like a luxurious beauty salon, not a typical dentist's office.'

'Chocolate has a long history that started in South America. Today, it's a big business worth millions of pounds. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter, which is 8% of all chocolate sold. Christmas is the only time when people eat more chocolate. The process of making chocolate began a long time ago, over 3,000 years ago, when the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans grew the cacao tree. The tree is an evergreen plant that grows in many parts of the world. The fruit of the tree has 20-40 seeds, which become cacao beans when dried. These beans can be used to make chocolate.

In the past, the Aztecs used cacao beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in the Aztec language. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar. For a long time, people in Europe didn't know about the drink, but eventually, chocolate houses were set up in big cities where people could go to drink it.

In the 19th century, a man named CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder, which made it easier to make chocolate. Later, a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, created the first chocolate bar. A Swiss company added milk to the process, and milk chocolate was born.

In the past, British chocolate was made by French companies, but then Cadbury created their famous Dairy Milk bar. The company even named their factory Bournville, which means 'town' in French. The bar became popular because of clever advertising that linked it to healthy milk from the English countryside.

Today, people in the UK eat about four chocolate bars a week, which means manufacturers have to find new ways to attract customers. One way is by making chocolate into different products, like ice cream or soft drinks. At the same time, cacao farmers are still feeling the effects of a drop in cocoa bean prices in the 1980s. Many small-scale farmers were forced out of business. So, next time you eat a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grew the cacao beans.'

She uses a special vehicle that's like a small car, but for the ocean. She dives down 3 kilometers to the ocean floor and stays there for 16 hours. 

The vehicle is very small, so she has to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. If something goes wrong, she can press a panic button and a small escape vessel will be released. It will quickly take her back to the surface.

I was tired, hungry, and dirty after my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted from all the traveling, and my mind was overwhelmed by foreign languages, timetables, and currencies. I thought, ""Never again!"" But the next year, and the year after, I said the same thing when I stepped off the train and back onto my own soil. As a young person under 25, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month with just one train ticket.

Carrying my backpack and sleeping on trains made me appreciate the simple things in life. I learned to be more wasteful, but in a fun way. I would get rid of old socks and books when I was done with them. This carefree attitude is what Inter-Rail is all about.

My friends and I thought the Inter-Rail ticket was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we soon discovered that we could travel to other countries without extra cost. We visited many places, but we mostly focused on the most obvious sights. This was our chance to escape the usual tourist routes and do something different.

We were proud of the fact that we didn't bother to see everything. We just wanted to have a good time and enjoy the journey. We shared our experiences with other travelers, and we were all excited to be exploring Europe together.

The thrill of travel comes from seeing a place for the first time. When the train arrives at the station, you see the city with your own eyes, and it's like it's brand new. Only by experiencing Europe firsthand can you really understand what it's like. Everyone knows what Europe is like, but it's not the same until you see it for yourself. That's why other people's holiday photos are often boring. The train trip may not teach you anything new, but it's a valuable experience.

'Lost luggage is a common problem for travelers. Imagine arriving at an airport and discovering that your suitcase is nowhere to be found. You may have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline finds your luggage. This can be especially frustrating if you're traveling to a different climate zone or to a place far from home.

Airline companies don't usually reveal how many bags they lose, but it's a fact that travelers will eventually experience this problem. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it's impossible to guarantee that your luggage will be on the same flight as you.

The airline's baggage system has a few flaws. For example, they require passengers to check in too early, which can cause delays. There are also minimum connecting times between flights, but these can be too short. Sometimes, flights are delayed due to security checks or air traffic problems, which can cause the baggage system to fail.

Additionally, there's always the risk of human error or accidents, especially at busy airports. For instance, London's Heathrow airport is one of the busiest, with over 41 million passengers passing through each year. Even at efficient airports like Amsterdam or Singapore, mistakes can happen.

To avoid losing your luggage, it's a good idea to choose direct flights whenever possible and check in early. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline and allow extra time for your connection. Make sure to label your luggage clearly with your home and holiday addresses, and don't forget to include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, you should report it to the airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report before leaving the airport.'

The kingfisher is a beautiful bird that lives near streams and rivers. It has a bright blue-green color and feeds on fish. The kingfisher's home is surrounded by old trees, which cast a shadow over the water. The colors of the scene are soft and natural, with shades of green, brown, and yellow. The bird moves quickly and smoothly through the water, creating a striking image. Charlie James, a wildlife photographer, has been fascinated by the kingfisher since he was young. He can't explain exactly why he loves the bird so much, but it's clear that he has a deep connection with it. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher is associated with the moon and is said to have transformed into a bird. Another story tells that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body turned blue and its underside was scorched by the sun. This story has some scientific truth to it. The kingfisher's feathers do not actually contain blue pigment, but the structure of its feathers reflects light and gives the appearance of blue. This is why the bird can appear to change color depending on the angle of the light. Charlie James has spent many years studying the kingfisher and has developed a passion for photographing it. He has built hideouts near the bird's favorite spots and has taken many pictures of it. Despite his love for the kingfisher, Charlie James has not always been successful in his career. He has missed school and struggled academically, but his passion for the kingfisher has led him to become a successful wildlife photographer and filmmaker. He hopes to make a film about the kingfisher that will show its beauty and importance without needing words.

""Choosing a Theme Park for Families

If you're thinking of taking your kids to a theme park in the UK, there are many options to choose from. We asked five families to test the best ones. Here's what they thought:

Fun Island - The Burns Family

We visited Fun Island and were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger kids, with rides like the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special ride for little ones. The older kids loved the scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! We thought the park was a bit lacking in atmosphere, but the staff were friendly and helpful.

Wonderland - The McMillan Family

We visited Wonderland and were impressed. The park has something for everyone, from the Mountain Train to the ferris wheel. The older kids loved driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and enjoyed the clean and well-organized park.

Adventure World - The Jeffree Family

We spent seven hours at Adventure World and still didn't see everything. The kids loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line, which was a bit scary. The park is well-designed, so queuing for rides isn't boring. The staff are great and the park is spotless.

The Great Park - The Langridge Family

We visited The Great Park, which is perfect for younger kids. The rides aren't too scary, and we all enjoyed Exotic Travels, a boat ride that gets more exciting towards the end. We queued for half an hour for Lightning River, but it was over before we knew it!

Fantasy World - The Break-all Family

Fantasy World lives up to its name, with Europe's tallest roller-coaster and many other rides. The kids loved the Rocket and the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres above the ground. We thought the staff were a bit mixed, but overall, it was a great day out.""

""Starting a business in the countryside

Five women share their experiences of setting up a business in the countryside. They all chose to leave the city to start their own businesses.

Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business. She and her husband moved to the countryside because they wanted a better work-life balance. She works from home, which saves her money on office rent. She has four employees and a turnover of over £200,000 a year.

Maggy Sasanow is a designer who works from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there weren't any jobs available in the countryside. So, she started her own business designing greetings cards. She sells her cards to museums and has a good reputation for being cheaper than other artists.

Delia Turner runs a curtain-making business. She started eight years ago and had a lot of success, but then the economy declined and she had to lay off her employees. Now, she works from home with the help of her husband and a few part-time workers.

Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside for financial reasons and to be closer to nature. She works with authors and artists from all over the world and has to be disciplined to shut the office door.

Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She started making fruit cakes at home and soon got requests from friends and relatives. She now employs six people and has a turnover of £250,000 a year.""

Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The Watkins family is very special because all the sons are musicians, and their dad makes the instruments they play. John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers, wanted to get their 10-year-old son Paul a cello to help him develop his musical talents. However, they found that buying one was too expensive, so John decided to learn how to make one himself. He took evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for three years and eventually made a cello for Paul. Paul still plays that cello today.

John has since stopped teaching and now makes violins full-time. He even sold one to a famous American musician, which was a great achievement. Both Paul and his younger brother Huw were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano, but soon switched to the cello because he loved watching the cellist in his dad's music group. Huw, on the other hand, started with the piano and later developed a passion for composition.

Now, Paul is a successful musician and has won many awards, including the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. He even became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at a young age. However, he has recently acquired a new cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. His dad, John, is proud of his son's achievement and has even had the chance to play both cellos. Huw is also making a name for himself as a pianist and composer. The family is very busy with their musical activities, and it can be challenging for their parents to keep track of everything they do.

'The National Trust is an organisation that works to protect the British countryside. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talked to Gareth Roberts, a warden who takes care of the beautiful areas owned by the Trust. Gareth thinks that to be a good warden, you need common sense and the ability to work well with people. He needs to deal with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders.

Gareth grew up on a farm on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked there until he got married. When he applied for the warden job, he was one of about 80 people who applied. He got the job because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he didn't have any formal training.

Gareth's farming background is helpful because he can understand the problems of farmers and deal with them on an equal level. He also knows how to handle the physical demands of the job, such as building fences and planting trees.

Gareth has learned more about nature conservation since he started working for the Trust. He used to collect flowers, butterflies, and birds' nests as a child, but he realises now that farming has affected the countryside. He thinks that farmers were just following government advice, and that conservationists and farmers can work together.

Gareth's job involves conservation, making sure people can visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He enjoys seeing projects finished and working with the public, except for some people who are not very nice to him. If you have common sense and like working outdoors, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth, but there might not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time.'

'The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, we met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. She's been training hard for the World Championships next month. When I talked to her, she'd just finished a day of teaching at a local school and a training session in the car park. ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice anything else,"" she said. ""I might see cars slowing down, but that's all.""

Kendra's whole life is now about being at her best for the Championships. She's on a strict schedule to get fit for the big event. This is her fourth time playing in the World Championships, and it's going to be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries taking part.

""We'll have the support of our home crowd, which is amazing,"" she said. ""And it's important to show that netball is a popular sport in this country. We'll have more pressure than usual, but that's okay. We're used to playing in front of big crowds.""

Their first game is against Barbados, and it's right after the opening ceremony. ""We've beaten them before, but they're a tough team,"" Kendra said. ""They have a lot of skill.""

The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to give it your all every day, with no rest between games. And you can still win even if you lose the first game. But in the Championships, there's only one chance, so you have to be ready.""

In the 15 years she's been playing at the top level, the sport has become faster and more competitive. ""Players are more aggressive now,"" she said. ""But once the game is over, we all become friends again.""

Netball is also using new methods to test players' fitness. ""We all have to think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra said. ""As captain, I need to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I support and encourage the rest of the team.""

Kendra has always planned her netball career carefully. She's decided that this will be her last big competition as a player. She'll probably coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on this event. When she leads her team out onto the court for the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'<|eot_id|>"

' SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to help a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always clear how to develop and encourage their gift. Some parents may not recognize and respond to their child's needs until they become frustrated and difficult to manage. Most schools are good at helping children who are very good at academic subjects, but those with musical talent need special support that may not be available in a regular school, especially if music is not a main focus. Children with exceptional musical ability, as well as those whose parents or teachers encourage their talent, may benefit from a specialist music school. There are five music schools in Britain that offer a special environment for children aged 7-18 to develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend most of their day on music activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, and theory. They also have private practice rooms and spend some time on core subjects like English, maths, and science. The schools are independent and have small classes with a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they spend their formative years with others who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some disadvantages. The schools are expensive, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year. Additionally, not all parents want their children to board at school, especially at a young age. Some directors of the schools question the wisdom of admitting children as young as 7 to such an intense environment. They stress that their goal is to produce well-rounded individuals. Setting musically gifted children apart from others can cause stress, and some may lose their early signs of musical ability in their teenage years. The schools keep a close eye on each student's progress and offer help if needed.

Some former students feel they benefited greatly from the high-quality music education, but others express concerns about the limited academic program. Many musically gifted students are also highly intelligent and can handle academic pressure, but may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. It may be better to wait until the child is old enough to make their own decisions before considering a specialist education. Those who are equally gifted academically may do well in a less specialized environment, such as a school with a strong music department or by combining regular school with music training at a junior music college. However, this option is not practical for families living outside of major cities.'<|eot_id|>"

Susan Shepherd is a famous artist who loves painting flowers. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some of the plants grow wildly and spread everywhere. The two long flower borders along the path in the garden are very beautiful, thanks to the previous owners who were good gardeners. Susan inherited the gardener, Danny, who helped her create the garden. She likes to paint individual flowers rather than the whole garden. She picks a flower, takes it to her studio, and paints it, then brings in another one and adds it to the painting. It can take a few days or even years to finish a painting.

Susan's busy season is in the spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. She loves watching them change shape and form over time. She has always been interested in plants and used to collect wild flowers as a child. Now, she grows plants from all over the world in her garden. She lets her garden grow a bit wild and doesn't worry too much about it. With two upcoming exhibitions, she's been busy painting and hasn't had much time to work in the garden lately.

She wakes up at 7 am to walk to the chalet, where she prepares breakfast for the guests. After breakfast, she cleans the rooms and prepares afternoon tea. In the afternoon, she goes skiing and usually returns to the chalet by 4:30 pm. She then prepares dinner, which is served at 8 pm.

Andrea Thompson - Newsreader

I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago. I try to visit as often as I can. There's a train that runs along the coast and into Italy. The views are amazing - you see beautiful coastlines, even in bad weather. You can see the homes of rich and famous people, and the train is full of tourists and locals who are all excited to be on this journey.

Raj Patel - Explorer

I've taken many train journeys, but my favourite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. I grew up in South Africa and always wanted to take a family train trip to Kruger National Park, but it didn't happen. When I moved to England as a teenager, I saw London Waterloo station for the first time and was amazed.

Betty Cooper - Novelist

I'm grateful for one special train - the Blue Train, which took me and my husband on our honeymoon to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. The journey was lovely, passing through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was a great way to relax after our wedding.

Martin Brown - Journalist

We were working on a project and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unpredictable, but when the train arrived, hundreds of people got on board. We even saw people climbing onto the roof! At night, the train passed through beautiful landscapes, like a dream.

I didn't grow up with trains, as I was raised in Singapore and Cyprus. I didn't see many trains until I was a teenager. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire.

Are you trying to get your writing published? If so, you're probably wondering where to send your work. Many people ask me, ""I've written a story/book, can you tell me who to send it to?"" First, you need to research the market and learn about publishers. This means reading widely and finding out what kinds of writing are popular at the moment. You can do this by visiting your local library and bookshops, and reading different types of publications.

It's also important to practice your writing skills. Whatever you write, you need to know what kind of writing is in demand. This means reading a lot and keeping up to date with new publications and changing trends. If you're not sure what you want to write about, start by finding out which magazines publish the type of writing you're interested in. For example, if you like writing love stories, find out which magazines use this type of content and read some recent issues.

When you're ready to send your work out, be prepared for rejection. It's normal to get rejected at first, even if you're a good writer. The key is to keep writing and improving your skills. Don't be discouraged if your work is rejected - it's all part of the process. Instead, use the feedback you receive to make your writing better and keep writing.

It's also important to be patient and persistent. Don't send out your work until it's ready, and don't be afraid to ask for help or join a writing group to get feedback and support. Remember, every successful writer has had to deal with rejection and criticism at some point. The most important thing is to keep writing and believe in yourself.

'I'm John Moore, the owner of a restaurant. I've written about my relationship with my son Gary, who's a famous TV chef. I believe everyone deserves a chance in life. My son Gary was given his chance in cooking, and I was given the chance to run a restaurant. When I saw the restaurant, it was in a bad state, but it was perfect for me. It reminded me of my childhood, when my mother worked in a factory and I was left alone. That's why I wanted to make sure my family had time together. My wife took care of the children and did the accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped our children, Gary and Joe, become confident. They would often talk to our regular customers from a young age. This gave them a great start in life.

Gary was a lively child who loved to play. He even jumped into our corner bath like a swimming pool when he was seven and knocked himself out! As he grew older, he started working for pocket money, doing odd jobs and then helping out in the kitchen every weekend. He was very disciplined and would often get up before me in the morning. I was proud to see him helping out in the family business.

Gary wasn't very academic, but he was amazing in the kitchen. By the time he was 15, he was as good as any of the other chefs, and sometimes he was even in charge. He could produce over 100 meals by himself. I knew then that he would go into catering. When he did his work experience at school, I sent him to a friend's restaurant. Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. Who knows what will happen to his cooking if his music takes off!

My advice to Gary is to focus on one thing at a time. He needs to chase his dreams, but not too many of them at once. I told him that if he doesn't achieve his goals by the age of 30, it might be too late. Gary went to catering college at 17 and quickly proved himself to be an exceptional cook. He's now a successful TV chef, and I'm extremely proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it.

For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt a bit nervous when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't really think about why she was going. It was just assumed that she would go.

'Dolphins are loved by many people. We enjoy watching them in marinas, films, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, their situation is very worrying. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species.

Dolphins are intelligent and sensitive animals that allow us to imagine a free and wonderful life in the sea. This love for dolphins has been encouraged by TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest. However, these happy portrayals hide the reality of dolphins' lives in polluted and overfished seas.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises has decreased by up to 89,000. You might expect such popular animals to be protected by law and cared for in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and the lack of plans to protect them may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.

There are 40 different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In European waters, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose, and harbour porpoise dolphins. The first two are usually found far out in the open sea, while the last two are often seen near European coasts.

Bottlenose dolphins are social and used to be found near the Channel coast and in British river mouths. However, their numbers have decreased, and the few remaining ones show signs of stress. The reasons for this decline are complex and difficult to determine.

Overfishing, which is reducing fish stocks worldwide, also threatens porpoises and dolphins. This is because porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish in one area are removed, they may not survive. They are also at risk of getting caught in fishermen's nets, which can be invisible to them.

In recent years, many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornish beaches, with signs of injury caused by getting caught in nets. Dolphins can also store waste and substances in their bodies, such as pesticides, which can harm them and their young.

Human disturbance is another threat to dolphins. They live in groups and receive information about their environment through sound. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells, and other sources can disturb them in ways we do not yet fully understand.'

Film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman travel to Africa for months at a time to make wildlife documentaries. They are not afraid of getting stuck in the mud or facing other challenges because they are passionate about their work. They have been working together for a long time and have developed a good understanding of each other's ideas.

Their latest project is about jackals, which are shy animals. They have to be patient and wait for the right moment to capture the perfect shot. They often spend weeks or even months in one place to get the footage they need.

Amanda and Owen work well together because they share the same vision and values. They want to make films that are not just informative but also emotional and engaging. They believe that if they can make people feel something, it's better than just teaching them facts.

In their daily routine, they make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask. They eat pre-packed meals and often go without a proper shower or laundry for weeks. But they are happy to make sacrifices because they love being in the wilderness and getting close to the animals.

In their experience, the best moments come when they can get close to the animals and become part of their lives. They remember a time when they were filming lions and one lioness would come to greet them as part of her daily routine.

Amanda and Owen have been working together since 1988 and have developed a strong partnership. They know what they want to achieve and work together to make it happen.<|eot_id|>"

'England's Netball Captain

Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski, to talk about the upcoming World Championships. Kendra has been training hard to get ready for the event. She spends her days teaching at a local school and then practicing her netball skills in a supermarket car park. Kendra said she doesn't notice the strange looks from people while she's training because she's too focused on her movements.

Kendra is determined to be at her best for the World Championships. She has a strict training schedule to improve her fitness. This is her fourth time competing in the World Championships, and she thinks it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries taking part.

The team will have the support of their home crowd, which Kendra thinks will be a big advantage. However, they will also feel more pressure to perform well. Their first game is against Barbados, a team they have beaten before, but Kendra thinks they will be tough opponents.

The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the World Championships will be challenging. She says that players have to be ready to play every day, with no rest between games. The team's goal is to win the championship, but Kendra is also focused on improving her mental attitude and leading her team by example.

Kendra has been playing netball for 15 years and has seen the sport become faster and more competitive. She believes that players need to think and train like world-class athletes. As captain, she wants to support and encourage her teammates.

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully and has decided that this will be her last competition as a player. After the World Championships, she may coach young players in the future. She is looking forward to leading her team out onto the court during the opening ceremony and is likely to be emotional about it.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at the B2 level:

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research on marine geochemistry, which is the study of the chemical processes in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on a special underwater journey. She gets into a small steel vehicle, like a small car, and dives 3 kilometers down to the ocean floor to study underwater volcanoes.

""It's very crowded inside,"" she says. ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can take 16 hours - 3 hours to get down, 10 hours to collect samples, and 3 hours to get back up.""

""If something goes wrong, there's an emergency button. The outside part of the vehicle opens, and a small escape boat comes out. It's like a ping-pong ball in a bathtub - it goes up quickly to the surface. Nobody has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.""

Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she went with a Russian team to a site west of the Canary Islands. There, they found a huge area of underwater volcanoes, with chimneys spewing out black smoke. This is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive.

When she's not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love. I do it so I can focus on my research on underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and turns into black smoke. It's like a chimney, pouring out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

""The only time I was scared was when I went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we were so relieved - we were still alive!""

""It's an amazing adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the window and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen them before. I studied underwater volcanoes for three years for my Ph.D. When I saw them for real, it was an incredible feeling.""

Here is the simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at the B2 level:

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our body language, and how we speak. Mary Pearce, a teacher, learned this the hard way. She didn't get a job at a primary school because the Head Teacher thought she didn't take the time to present herself well. The Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take care of their appearance, what kind of teacher will they be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, agrees. He says that people who take care of themselves are more likely to care about their work. Many people forget the importance of dressing professionally. Janet Goodwood, an administrative assistant, didn't get an interview for a promotion because the office manager thought she didn't fit the image of an office manager. The manager suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again.

Our body language and facial expressions also play a big role in making a good impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 55% of our message comes from our facial expressions, 38% from our voice, and only 7% from our words. Make sure your words match your body language to avoid confusing the interviewer.

It's also important not to show too much enthusiasm or eagerness for a job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, got a job offer on the spot, but her enthusiasm led the boss to offer her a lower salary than she expected. Finally, knowing about the company and preparing some questions to ask during the interview can make a big difference. David Artesio, a manager, suggests reading the company's annual report to learn about their activities and interests. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, recommends having a few short, clear questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences.

**Four Young Sports Stars Share Their Lives**

Meet Darius, Gabriel, Dieter, and Tomas, four young athletes who are passionate about their sports. Let's hear what they have to say about their lives.

**Darius (runner)**

I've always been into sports. I played many sports when I was younger, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I decided to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country's youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing. I train hard, both at home and abroad, to prepare for competitions. My goal is to compete in the next Olympics.

**Gabriel (surfer)**

The surfing community is small, so I see the same people wherever I compete. Professional surfers are very dedicated and often need to give up late-night parties to focus on their training. I don't mind too much, but I do love sleeping in and having a lie-in is usually not an option. However, it's worth it, as I won the National Championships last year and got to present a surfing series on TV. I do like to celebrate with a big night out after a win, especially if there's prize money involved.

**Dieter (yacht racer)**

When I'm on a boat with my teammates, we have a great time. We're a traditional group and like to celebrate our wins in style. We don't actively seek media attention, but sometimes reporters are more interested in where we go out to celebrate than our actual performance. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back and do normal things with friends. I'm known within the sailing community, but I'm not a celebrity outside of it. I enjoy getting letters from fans and always reply to them.

**Tomas (tennis player)**

It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd's support. However, it can get chaotic sometimes. I do enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out and about, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. As a tennis player, I have to travel a lot, and that's why we split up. You have to make sacrifices in any sport, but I'm focusing on my game now and will catch up on other things when I retire.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B2 on the CEFR:

Taking children to the supermarket can be a difficult experience for some parents. Children often want everything they see, including the latest sugary cereals, Disney videos, and comics. Parents may feel guilty if they agree to their demands, knowing that they are buying unhealthy food. On the other hand, saying no can make them feel cross and defensive. Some parents try to avoid taking their children shopping, but this can also make them worry about not teaching their children how to make good choices.

Research shows that children make a purchase request every two minutes when they are with their parents in the supermarket. The food industry spends a lot of money on advertising, especially on TV, and this is likely to increase. Children often don't understand why their parents can't afford certain things, and they are easily swayed by attractive advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that parents are concerned about what they feed their children, but they may not always have accurate ideas about what is healthy. She believes that parents and children should have a conversation about food, but this can be difficult when children are bombarded with advertisements.

Some parents feel stressed when deciding what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says she tries to discuss food with her children and teaches them to read labels. She has found that this helps to reduce conflict in the supermarket.

Parents often admit that they are inconsistent in their responses to their children's requests. One father says that he refuses to buy his son sweets because they are bad for him, but he buys unhealthy foods for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent and says that it depends on his mood.

Supermarkets could make shopping easier for parents by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This could make parents more likely to shop without their children, which could actually attract more customers.

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin after nearly two years of work. The hotel is based in four large 18th-century houses, which has allowed the latest technology to be installed. The hotel's General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know each guest's name and preferences. To help with this, the hotel has a computer system that costs PS250,000. This system will pay for itself over time, according to MacCann.

The hotel's technology includes a guest-history facility, which allows staff to record guests' preferences. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. The hotel also has a system that lets guests control the room temperature themselves.

The hotel is designed for business users, who make up about 65% of the hotel's customers. Each room has a business centre with a phone, fax machine, and video-conferencing facility. The hotel has also laid extra cables to prepare for future technological advances.

Despite all the technology, the hotel has tried to make the rooms comfortable and welcoming. There are 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, and a beautiful garden. The hotel also has two bars, two restaurants, and a popular Dublin restaurant with two Michelin stars.

The hotel's food is excellent, and the chef, Patrick Guilbaud, has been able to design a new kitchen and modernize his business. The hotel's staff is highly capable, and with the help of technology, the Merrion looks set to be a successful hotel.

**Ice Skating: A Fun and Challenging Activity**

Ice skating has a long history that dates back thousands of years. Archaeologists have found old skates made from animal bones. In the past, only the upper class in Scandinavia skated, but in the 1920s, a young figure skater named Sonja Henie popularized the sport and made it more accessible to everyone.

Today, ice skating combines art and athleticism. To start, it's important to focus on balance and control. As you gain experience, you can increase your speed. The position of your body is crucial for balance. Keep your knees slightly bent and your body weight centered. It's also essential to relax while skating, as it can be a physically demanding activity.

When you start, keep your heels together and your feet turned outwards. Push off with one foot while making a small movement with the other. As you get more comfortable, you can increase the length of your movements. It's also important to know how to fall safely. Even experienced skaters fall sometimes, but by relaxing your body, you can reduce the impact of the fall.

To get up after falling, kneel down and then stand up. Once you're confident on the ice, you can try different styles, such as figure skating, freestyle, or speed skating. It's best to start with figure skating and then move on to freestyle. Many ice rinks offer lessons and guidance to help you learn the basics.

To improve your skating, it's essential to practice regularly and do exercises to loosen up your body. This includes exercises for your legs, back, and shoulders, with a focus on your ankles and knees. After a long or intense skating session, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness. Ice skating can improve your balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It's also a great way to stay healthy and fit, especially when combined with other activities like swimming or jogging.

Annika's training is very demanding. She has no time for TV, friends, or other activities. She tries to take it one day at a time and sometimes her coach gives her a day off. Sarah, 15, won the British National Championship in show-jumping. She loves the excitement and fun of competitions. Her parents support her and take her to shows all over the country.

Jane, 10, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. She finds tournaments friendly and fun. She doesn't get nervous and doesn't talk about her success at school. Her parents encouraged her to play chess from a young age and are proud of her achievements.

Annika's mother said that Annika was shy and timid before she started gymnastics. Now she's confident and has met people from all over the world.

It's true that we're all getting taller. Chris Greener, who is now Britain's tallest man at 228 cm, was already very tall when he was 14. In fact, the average height of people in Europe is increasing by one centimetre every decade. This means that more and more people are growing taller. But this doesn't mean that we're becoming a new kind of superhuman. Instead, we're returning to what our ancestors were like thousands of years ago.

In the past, our ancestors ate a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. They even ate 85 different types of wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, people started farming, which had a big impact on our diet. Today, just three types of plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide most of the calories we need. This diet has had a negative effect on our health and physical development.

For a long time, people have been eating soups, porridges, and breads that are not very nutritious. This has led to problems like tooth decay and diseases. In one study, scientists found that when people started eating corn, they became unhealthy and underweight. However, farming allowed more people to live in the same area, which was a big advantage.

Now, some countries are trying to improve their diets and eat more like our ancestors did. As a result, the average height of people in some countries is increasing. But there are also some problems. For example, beds and furniture are still the same size they were 150 years ago, and clothes manufacturers are having to make new sizes all the time.

Scientists are trying to figure out how tall we can grow. Some think we might reach a maximum height of 193 cm, but others think we might start to shrink again because of global warming.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being filmed? I found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV production, but many people don't know much about them. We often see them on game shows, clapping and cheering, and wonder who they are. Some people think studio audiences are made up of people who just want to be on TV for a few seconds. But that's not true. People from all walks of life attend studio audiences. TV producers try to get different types of people for different types of shows. Some people might think, ""Why would anyone want to watch TV in a studio when they can watch it at home?"" But there are reasons why people apply for tickets, travel, and spend hours waiting in a studio. Some people hope to appear on TV, while others are curious to see how TV shows are made. Many people just got tickets from friends. I spoke to some audience members and found out that they enjoy the experience. For some, it's more exciting than watching at home. They like being part of a live show and feeling connected to the performers. However, my own experience was different. I was squished among strangers, and all I could see was the back of someone's head. But for most audience members, it's just a fun and free night out.

I also like a miniature railway in Kent that runs through the countryside. The scenery is not exciting, but I enjoy watching people's daily routines from the train window. I like seeing ordinary things, like people making tea or doing laundry.

My friends have a special place in Cornwall, called the Hartland Peninsula. It's a remote and beautiful coast with few visitors. We stay in a small cottage and enjoy hiking and exploring the area.

**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We love animals and enjoy their company. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work with exciting news. She had found a beautiful pine snake! ""Can we keep it?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for temporary visitors, and I wanted to admire the snake and learn more about it.

I was running late, so I quickly boiled some water when I got home. But as I entered the bedroom, I heard screams from my sons. I rushed in to find Domino, our cat, chasing Bianca, a white mouse, around the room. The cat had the mouse's feet in its mouth and was trying to find a way out.

I joined the chaos and tripped over something. As I got up, I saw the snake had escaped from its tank and was slithering across the floor. I crouched down, ready to catch it, but it was too fast. The snake and I were both being jumped over by the cat, mouse, and kids, who were screaming and hissing. The dog was barking loudly.

I managed to catch the cat by the tail and freed the mouse from its mouth. The snake was still on the loose, so I looked for a way to catch it. It was very slippery, but I finally managed to pick it up and sit on the floor like a snake charmer. The snake relaxed and eventually allowed me to stand up and release it into the garden.

As I watched it go, my children and I stood in silence. Then my eldest son, DJ, explained, ""You're nice and warm, Mum, and the shed isn't."" I encouraged the kids to help the snake move away from the shed. It slowly slid up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of tail disappeared, my three-year-old son, Clay, said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!""

'Write to me! In today's world of emails and text messages, the old-fashioned art of writing letters is almost disappearing. But for me, there's something special about receiving a letter. You get excited when it arrives, you're curious about who it's from, and you enjoy reading the contents. I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember. As a child, I would write little notes to my mother. My mother always wanted me to write thank-you letters for presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I moved to London to study medicine at 18, I would write to my family once a week. My parents would also write to me, and it was always nice to receive their letters. They would tell me about their daily lives and their friends. We would also make phone calls, but I remember the letters more. I've had many penfriends over the years. When I was younger, I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away from home, and I could only stay in touch through letters. But writing letters actually helped our relationships. I found it easier to express myself in writing than in talking. I love getting birthday and Christmas cards with letters inside. It's better than just getting a quick note. And it's even more special when the letter comes from abroad, with interesting stamps. I have penfriends in Sri Lanka, Australia, and Canada. I've even had a penfriend in France, whom I met in a restaurant. We've stayed in touch for years and have even visited each other's homes. I'm glad that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I want them to write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes little notes to me, just like I did to my mother.

The site was classified as a historic monument years ago, and the Ministry of Culture is responsible for protecting it. However, the department in charge of the site does not have enough money to hire enough guards to prevent damage. They may have to charge visitors a fee to enter the site.

One researcher thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. She believes that the Ministry of Culture should provide the necessary funds to protect the site. If nothing is done, the drawings may be lost for future generations.'

Here is the simplified text for a B2 level learner:

Taking children shopping can be very challenging for some mothers. They often want everything they see, especially sugary cereals, Disney videos, and comics. Mothers feel guilty when they agree to buy these things, but they also feel bad saying no. They worry that their children will not learn how to make their own choices. Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes while shopping. Advertisers spend a lot of money on TV ads targeting children, and this is likely to increase. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy them everything they want. They are influenced by attractive and persuasive ads, and parents' explanations about sugar and health are not convincing.

According to Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance, parents are concerned about what they feed their children, but their ideas about healthy food are not always accurate. Parents and children should have a dialogue about food, but TV ads give children a one-sided view. Parents feel like they are competing with advertisers and are forced to disappoint their children. The Independent Television Commission prohibits ads that tell children to ask their parents to buy something, but the intention is still to persuade children to ask for the product.

Some parents find it stressful to decide which demands to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks to her children about food and labels, and they have little conflict while shopping. Parents also admit they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, a father, says he refuses to buy sweets for his son because they are bad for him, but he still buys treats for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent and sometimes says yes to his children's requests when he's feeling generous.

Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas. This might encourage parents to shop without their children, which could attract more customers.

Here's the simplified text, adapted for a B2 level learner:

'Indoor climbing walls have become popular. Climbers used to go to mountains, but now they can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd watches in awe as French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by his fingers at the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham. The National Indoor Arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events share something in common - The Wall. This is all thanks to a new technology. In the past, climbers would climb on cliffs in areas with good climbing angles. During the winter, they would either tolerate the cold or go walking instead. However, as the sport developed, top climbers needed to stay fit. When the cliffs were unusable, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to practice. This helped keep their fingers strong and prevented boredom. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing, using bricks with special edges. These early walls were inspired by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He created a block of concrete with natural rock inside, which could be used in a wall. Many climbing walls were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s. However, these walls had limitations. They could only be built vertically, unlike cliffs, which have features like overhangs and angled rock. Climbers would eventually get bored with the repetitive nature of the walls. In 1985, a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, developed a material that could be moulded into shapes like those found on cliffs. This could be attached to any existing wall and removed when climbers got bored. French manufacturers also experimented with panels on steel frames. Steel frames could be built anywhere and were lighter than concrete, making it possible to create overhanging walls. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers an endless supply of new holds.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B2 level learner:

Do you want to be an actor? When you tell someone you want to make a career in acting, they might say it's a risky choice. And it's true, there are many people who want to be actors, but there aren't as many jobs available. Some people might even think you're crazy for choosing this career. But it's a personal choice, and only you can decide if it's right for you.

Becoming an actor isn't easy. There are no exams to pass or a guaranteed way to succeed. It's a combination of luck and talent. However, there is always a demand for new actors and the possibility of exciting opportunities.

So, what makes someone talented? I believe it's a mix of natural ability and imagination. And it's not just about being good at acting, but also about being brave and believing in yourself.

Why do people want to act? For many, it's the thrill of performing in front of an audience. This connection with the audience is what drives actors to keep acting. Even experienced actors won't know exactly what makes them successful. They might know some things about themselves and their technique, but they always stay humble and know that they can't take anything for granted.

Actors also know that they can't control everything. They might be out of work one day and get a part the next. This uncertainty can be stressful, so they find ways to cope with the pressure. Nobody likes being rejected, and actors are no exception. From the moment they start looking for parts, they have to be prepared for rejection.

Ultimately, it's up to the actor to show they care about their craft and themselves. If they don't care, nobody else will.<|eot_id|>"

To simplify the text for a learner of level B2, I will make some adjustments to the vocabulary, sentence structure, and complexity while maintaining the factual content. Here is the revised text:

Chris Greener, the tallest man in Britain, is 228 cm tall. When he was 14, he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be?"" Chris replied, ""The flagpole on a ship."" The teacher had a point, as Chris was already quite tall at 14.

Every decade, the average height of Europeans increases by one centimetre. This means that more people are growing taller. However, this doesn't mean that humans are becoming a new species. Instead, we're returning to our natural height, similar to our ancestors who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, people ate a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and animals. This diet was diverse and provided all the necessary nutrients. However, about 9,000 years ago, people started farming, which had negative consequences. Most of the land was used for farming, and only a few plants like wheat, rice, and maize provided most of our calories. This diet was not good for our health and physique.

As a result, people became underfed and underdeveloped. In one study, scientists found that when hunter-gatherers started eating corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn was not a healthy food for humans.

Despite this, farming spread because it allowed more people to live on the same land. However, many people still rely on this system, which is not good for their health. Only in some countries like the US, Holland, and Japan are people eating a more diverse diet again, which has led to an increase in average height.

The average height in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it also has its challenges. For example, beds and furniture are still the same size as they were 150 years ago, and clothes manufacturers have to constantly update their sizes.

The question is, where will our height stop growing? Will we reach a maximum height, and if so, what will it be? Some scientists think it could be as high as 193 cm, but others point out that as a species, we may be getting smaller due to climate change.

'From childhood game to successful business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties, are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, playing a game that brings back memories of their childhood. The game is called pichenotte, which was introduced to their family by their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada. The family played the game every weekend and holiday, and it became a big part of their family tradition. When they moved to New Mexico, they continued to play, and visitors would often be fascinated by the game, which was unknown in the southern USA.

Three years ago, Dave decided to make a new pichenotte board, and it was a huge success. People loved the game, and soon the brothers were making more boards and selling them at markets and craft fairs. The game became very popular, and they even started a championship with a trophy called the Lord Pichenotte Cup. As the game's popularity grew, the brothers decided to turn their hobby into a business. They set up a workshop in their garage and started making more boards. So far, they have produced over 450 boards, which are made of birchwood and mahogany and are very durable.

The brothers sell their boards on their website for $595 each. While there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, the brothers are hopeful that their business will continue to grow and make them successful.'

'Welcome to the Model Village! When I first saw this place, I couldn't believe it was once a piece of wasteland. For years, it was considered useless, but one man's hard work and his wife's support turned it into this beautiful village. Thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to create the landscape you see today. It took a lot of effort, with bulldozers and machines helping, but also many hours of manual labor.

To create the lawns, flowerbeds, and rockeries, we brought in about 1,000 tons of topsoil. We also planted hundreds of trees and shrubs, carefully choosing ones that could tolerate the salty air near the sea and strong winter winds. Some plants came from local nurseries, while others were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models over nine years. He used different materials like stone, concrete, and special wood to make the models durable. At first, he needed help from experts, but soon he became an expert himself.

You'll notice that everything is made to scale and that even the smallest details are carefully done. This took a lot of patience and developing special techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance.

The models you see are not based on specific buildings, but are typical British architectural styles. One of the most impressive is the Manor House, a 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls. As you walk around the village, you'll also see a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models, as this can cause damage. You're welcome to take photos from the paths only. Dogs are allowed on a short leash. To make your visit more enjoyable, you'll see buttons in front of some of the working models. Press these to make them operate.

We would love to hear your comments at the end of your visit. We're always planning new models and would appreciate any ideas you have. If you notice any models that aren't up to standard, please let us know. We're always updating and replacing models, so your feedback is important to us. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again soon. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!'

""Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules of journalism. While some celebrities might pose for photographers, most people in the public eye suffer when their private moments are captured on the front page. However, very few people complain to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization that was set up to deal with such issues. Most of these pictures are not in the public interest. Do pictures of famous people help solve crimes? In what way did a recent picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. The PCC didn't investigate, which is a scandal. They should also investigate a recent story about a pop star's private life. The pop star didn't complain either. Shouldn't the PCC take the initiative and investigate other similar cases? This seems like a good idea at first, but there are many problems. The PCC would have to decide whether to launch an investigation and how to do it. They might have to approach the person involved and encourage them to complain. But if the person refuses, should the PCC still investigate? There are also practical problems. How could the PCC monitor all British newspapers and magazines? And what about the embarrassment factor? Even if someone's privacy has been invaded, do they really want an investigation? Most people just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might come out, and they don't want it to become public. In short, it's hard to find a solution to this serious problem.""

Many people get advice on what to do after leaving college and starting their first job. But what about those who want to move to a second job? We're not talking about people who are looking for a temporary job while they search for a permanent one, or those who leave a job after just a few weeks. Instead, we're looking at people who are taking a step up in their career, choosing a job that fits with their goals and ambitions. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on what you want to achieve in the long term. Do you want to specialize in a particular field, take on more responsibility, or move into a new area? Whatever you decide, you should choose your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job, as it will show that you have thought about your career and are committed to it. Most importantly, it should help you grow and develop as a person, and give you more responsibility.

If you're feeling restless and want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily while you're away, and then come back and find a new job. Employers will be impressed that you've had the experience and are not likely to get bored easily.

He showed me his collection of kites, all made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat under a tree and watched the festival. There were 10 platforms where people held up their kites, and a row of competitors waiting for the start. When the whistle blew, the kites went up in the air like rockets.

New Picture

The Gallery has a beautiful still life painting by a Dutch artist from the 18th century. The painting is of flowers and fruit and is very colorful. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. The artist waited for certain flowers to bloom before painting them. The painting was given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister. You can see it in Room 25.

Special Exhibition

The exhibition 'Painting in Spain during the late 18th century' opened on 15 March. The Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters from this period. The exhibition will run until 31 May.

Lectures

There are lectures every Wednesday to go with the special exhibition. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will talk about Melendez, and on 12 April, Sarah Symmons will talk about Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists tell stories through their pictures.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

'Money What is money? Money is like a unit of measurement, just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. A £5 note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that doesn't cost much to make. A long time ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Instead, people would trade things with each other. For example, a farmer might exchange the corn he grew for some honey from a beekeeper. This was a simple exchange between two people who had something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own systems of money so that people could trade more easily. As different systems joined together, we now use a national currency.'

Hypatia: The First Woman Scientist

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 AD. For a long time, she was the only woman scientist to be remembered in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University and made sure she got the best education available. This was unusual because most women didn't have many opportunities to study at that time. Hypatia studied in Athens and Rome before returning to Alexandria, where she started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. Although we don't have copies of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented some scientific tools to help her with her work. Unfortunately, many rulers at that time were afraid of science, and people connected with it were in danger. One day, in March 415, Hypatia was attacked and killed in the street.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

'Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grass and they can be found in every part of the world. Grass is the only flowering plant that can survive in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many different animals, from tiny insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from the roots, not from the top of the plant. This means that many families of animals can live together in the same area. When they have eaten all the grass, new grass will grow again, providing a fresh food source.'

She didn't tell her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream of making a career out of fashion. She thought they wanted her to work in a more established business, so she studied management at university. After graduating, Kal moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. However, she couldn't afford the expensive clothes she liked to wear to industry events. She started making her own clothes and friends liked them so much that they asked her to make more. Kal found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a trial basis. They were very popular, and nothing came back. This encouraged Kal to leave her advertising job and start her own fashion label. Her parents were surprised but supportive, which made her very happy. Kal's business is now in over 70 stores, and she earns over £500,000 per year. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, and she even designs clothes for famous pop stars. Kal feels very lucky and says, ""What I do is my hobby, and I get paid for it! But I've worked hard for this.""

The new line was finished just before my trip. The train is not very fast, with few stops and mostly holidaymakers on board. It's not like luxury trains like the Orient Express, but the food is good. The train was originally built to carry goods, not people. It was thought to be a faster and cheaper way to send goods from Europe to Australia's southern cities. The Ghan is the world's first north-south train, and I was excited to take it. I met many Australian pensioners on board, who were looking forward to the journey. Our first stop was Katherine, where some passengers went on a boat trip. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I took a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. We walked around the rock and watched the sunset. Many passengers break their journey here, as there are only two trains a week heading south from Alice Springs. The view after Alice Springs is not very interesting, just flat land with cattle. But on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean.

'Climbing Ben Nevis in Scotland is a popular activity. Many people climb the mountain every year. Ben Nevis is a big mountain, and the weather can be very cold because it's located in the north. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time climbing Ben Nevis in winter.

In February, Keith and his group decided to climb the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This is a long climb, about 600 metres up. They planned to camp for three days on the way. They brought tents, sleeping bags, and special spikes for their boots because the snow was very hard and slippery.

Although some members of the group were experienced climbers, they took all the necessary safety equipment, including lights, hard hats, and extra clothing. The weather forecast was good, but they were still a bit nervous. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.

The track was steep, and Keith's legs felt heavy. He had to rest more often than the others because he was not as experienced. The group waited for him to catch up, but then they continued climbing. Keith realized that he should train more before climbing in the future.

After climbing for 200 metres, they reached the beginning of Tower Ridge, a narrow path that takes you to the top of the mountain. The path is only 1.5 metres wide, and the mountain drops away on both sides. They had to be careful and concentrate as they walked along it. It took them seven hours to reach the top.

From the top, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. However, on this day, there was a mist, so they couldn't see very far. Climbing down the mountain can be just as challenging as climbing up. You need to be able to read a map correctly to avoid taking a wrong turn. Keith was relieved that they took turns reading the map to ensure they got back to camp safely. Keith only felt like he really enjoyed the experience when he was safely in his tent. He was glad he made it to the top.'

It was exciting to watch the builders clear the land and start building, but it was also sad to see the open space disappear. The noise from the machines was loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop work because of the rain. We thought it would never be finished! Now we have five big classrooms, which are much larger than our old school next door. We also have a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms that we're looking forward to using when our new sports field is ready. When you enter the school, you'll notice that it's very warm inside, but there are no heaters! The heat comes from us, the children, the teachers, and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it keeps all the heat inside. You'll also notice that the roof has a tree on it! The builders put it there as a special touch. The electricity comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went to see it yesterday, and it's really impressive. We'll put some pictures on our website.

""Sharks are some of the most fascinating creatures in our oceans. They are well adapted to living underwater because they have excellent eyesight and special sensors on their bodies that help them detect movement. This makes them formidable predators for smaller sea creatures that become their prey. Although sharks share some similarities with other fish, they have some distinct differences. For instance, most sharks need to swim constantly to breathe and survive, so they don't sleep much. Another unusual feature is that if a shark is turned over on its back, it can stop moving altogether. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to handle sharks, as it helps them learn more about these incredible creatures.""

Here is the simplified text:

My name is Nathalie, and I'm a student at the Kirov Ballet in St Petersburg, Russia. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the school. At first, I was a bit nervous because I didn't know anyone. But everyone was friendly and helped me communicate in English. Now, six months later, I've made many friends and my Russian has improved a lot. My teachers are nice and easy to understand.

When I first arrived, my mum stayed with me for two weeks. When she left, I missed her a bit. I even called her late at night because I felt a bit lonely. But I've settled in now and feel at home. The ballet classes are challenging, but I'm working hard to keep up. I need to eat a lot to have enough energy. In my free time, I like watching movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish.

I enjoy exploring the city and visiting shops. Even in December, when it was very cold, I liked walking around. I bought a warm hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was actually quite mild for the time of year! My room is always warm and cozy. Right now, we're preparing for a new production, and I'm going to take part in a competition for young dancers. I feel very lucky to be here.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened some sentences to make them easier to understand
* Removed some idiomatic expressions and phrases (e.g. ""I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate"" became ""But everyone was friendly and helped me communicate in English"")

THE ICEHOTEL

For a long time, people went to the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in the winter, the few people who lived there had the snow and ice to themselves. In the late 1980s, someone had an idea to use the winter for something special. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to create an art exhibition in a special igloo in a small town called Jukkasjarvi, near the frozen Torne River. The igloo, called Arctic Hall, was a big success and many people came to visit.

One night, a group of visitors had the idea to sleep in the igloo. They were very happy with their experience and this idea led to the creation of the ICEHOTEL. Today, it's a famous hotel all around the world.

Every year, a team of builders, architects, and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They use natural materials like snow and ice to build it. The hotel is finished in parts, and each part opens to visitors and guests as it's completed. The first part is finished in December, and then a new part opens every week until January 7th.

Since the hotel is built outside, the finishing date depends on the weather. In the spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, it's never colder than -5°C to -8°C, even if it's very cold outside. Guests are provided with warm clothing, but it's a good idea to bring extra warm clothes, like sweaters and socks.

The hotel is located in Jukkasjarvi, near the Arctic Circle. It's close to Kiruna airport and train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the hotel.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary

""A new furniture shop, Homestyle, had a surprise when it opened at midnight last Thursday. Over 6,000 people came to the shop, attracted by special deals like a leather sofa for £45 and a bed for £30. The shop was supposed to be open 24 hours, but it had to close just half an hour after opening. A police officer who was called to the scene said that the crowd was too big and people were not patient. The shop staff decided to close the doors to keep everyone safe. The problem was that there were many cars trying to park, and some people even left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the rest of the way. This blocked the road completely.

One customer, Jenny Smith, was in the shop for three hours but didn't have time to buy everything she wanted. She said the staff were calm and explained the situation. They didn't have a choice, as it wasn't safe. Jenny plans to come back when the shop reopens, but she's not willing to queue again.""

In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters underwater and come back up without help. She held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which is a record for a woman. A team of safety divers watched her dive.

Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya believes that safety and training are the most important things. She trains for her events by doing exercises at the gym, in the pool, and in the ocean. She also uses a special bike to improve her heart fitness. Tanya doesn't run because she doesn't want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks quickly to stay fit.

When Tanya is not preparing for an event, she travels to make public appearances to promote sports products. She also helps environmental organizations by doing research or making films. Tanya grew up on the island of Grand Cayman, where she loved swimming and exploring the ocean. She says that her life today is like living her childhood dreams.

As a well-known person, Tanya thinks people listen to her when she talks about environmental issues. In the future, Tanya plans to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at the age of 25 and doesn't plan to stop for many years.'

After taking a year off to travel, I received an email from my mom saying they were making the book into a TV series. I knew I had to audition for the part. My mom was surprised at first, but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. We started filming outdoors just a week into term, so I got permission to take three weeks off from university. When I got back, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on my essays. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was cool. It was an incredible experience and I feel lucky. After university, I want to make acting my career. Although I'm not from an acting family, my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles, but haven't got any yet. I don't know how I managed it all, as I had a full social life too.

Norwich is a city in East Anglia, England, with a history dating back over 2,000 years. It started as a small village near the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, Norwich had grown into one of the largest towns in England. The city has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for people of different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. Norwich also celebrated its 800th anniversary in 1994, marking the year it received a Royal Charter and became an independent city.

Although Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of around 150,000, it has a rich history. In the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. The city continued to grow and became famous for its many churches and pubs. Today, there are still many churches and pubs, but the city has also developed modern attractions. The University of East Anglia is located in Norwich, which has brought a growing student population and a thriving commercial centre. The city now has a wide range of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and leisure centres.

Norwich is also home to a football team, known as 'The Canaries', although the reason for this name is unclear. The city has a new shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall', which has a park with water features and trees in the middle. The old market remains in the city centre, next to the new development, and continues to be popular.

'Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States becomes a kaleidoscope of colours in the sky. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that has been running for over 40 years. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, there were just a dozen hot-air balloons. Today, over a thousand balloons from around the world attend the festival.

What to see and do

During the festival, the pilots of the hot-air balloons communicate with each other and simultaneously light up their burners, creating a spectacular sight known as a 'balloon glow'. This is a great opportunity to take amazing photos. However, you need to arrive at the festival site just before sunset or early in the morning to see the balloons take off in the dark sky.

During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all shapes and sizes, with some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, and even popular brands. Kids will love it!

You can also take a ride in a hot-air balloon over the desert or ride a cable car to the top of the nearby mountains for a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other activities for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks displays.

Practical tips

Buy your tickets online in advance to avoid long queues. Wear layers of thin clothing, as it can be cool in the evening and early morning, but hot during the day. Bring a flashlight for night-time events, a camera, and suncream. If you're not a digital photographer, bring high-speed film for evening and night-time photos.'

He wrote about important events, such as diseases, a foreign navy sailing up the Thames, and a big fire in London. He also wrote about himself, including his mistakes - like falling asleep in church or looking at pretty girls. Pepys wrote about his family life, including a fight with his wife and how they made up. He was worried about her illness. Pepys liked reading, music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. He was a busy person with many important jobs - he was a politician and a leader of a scientific group.

'History of Shoes

In the past, people didn't think about making shoes comfortable or fashionable. They wore animal skins to keep their feet warm in cold weather. We still use leather today, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton. It wasn't until about 150 years ago that people started wearing a different shoe on each foot. Before that, people wore the same type of shoe on both feet. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now most are made in big factories using machines. The invention of sewing machines helped the shoe industry produce many more shoes at a lower cost, making them more affordable for more people.'

THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD

In the late 1800s, people came to Alaska to search for gold. One town that grew quickly was Iditarod, which means 'far away place'. In the summer, supplies could be delivered by boat, but in the winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter road was built for dog teams to travel along. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. The road became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took three weeks for the dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could rest and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s, when planes replaced dog teams as the main way to travel. However, the dogs got one last big job in 1925. A disease called diphtheria spread to the city of Nome, and the closest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. The only pilot who could fly in the cold weather was away, so it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey was over 1,000 km, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams six days to complete the journey. The medicine was delivered, and the diphtheria was stopped. One of the dogs, Balto, became a hero for saving the team from icy water. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the same route as that famous journey. It's called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.

I play the trumpet in my school's jazz band. Last month, we took part in a jazz competition with other schools from our area. We wore black uniforms and played really well, considering we're all still young. Some of the other bands wore bright clothes, but we all had a great time. During the competition, some musicians even created new songs on the spot. It was thrilling to watch, and even more exciting when it was our turn to play!

Not everyone can join our jazz band, as it's quite competitive. Only about half of the students who want to play get in. But those who do get to join go to extra practice before school and often hang out together after school, listening to jazz and learning about its history. We also go on trips to jazz camps in other parts of the country. It's surprising that young people like us are interested in jazz, but our music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for us. I love jazz because it's both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel like you're part of a long tradition. We're really lucky to have great teachers and supportive parents who help us with our music.'

Winter driving can be risky because it's hard to predict what will happen and accidents can happen quickly. Fog can suddenly appear over a hill, and ice can be hidden under the snow, waiting to cause an accident. A car coming towards you might also slide across the road. To stay safe, follow two important rules.

First, drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make your car hard to control. Imagine you're driving with a cup of hot coffee next to you - drive slowly and carefully so you don't spill it.

Second, be aware of what might happen. On icy roads, you need to look further ahead than usual. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be going faster than you think. When the road is wet, snowy, or icy, leave more space between you and the car in front. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you'll avoid trouble.'

Craigie Aitchison was a Scottish painter. He went to London to study law, but ended up at art school instead. He didn't enjoy the traditional drawing classes, but continued to paint. In his late 20s, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. This is where he developed an interest in early Italian artists, which is reflected in some of his work. He loved the green and brown colours of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this in his paintings. To achieve this, he paints thin layers of colour on top of each other, from light to dark. He claims he never knows what the final result will be. 'It's a secret,' he says, 'because I don't know myself.'

Aitchison believes that anyone can learn to mix colours. 'You can buy the colours,' he says. 'I just notice what colours go well together.' Unlike some artists, he doesn't make sketches before starting a painting. He thinks that if he did, he might lose interest in the painting. Instead, he makes many changes to his paintings before they're finished. This is why he prefers to work with models who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I think they're worried and want to see the painting, I can't work,' he says.

Aitchison has lived in London for many years, but he doesn't feel part of the Scottish art scene. He doesn't want to follow any particular style or tradition, he just paints the way he wants to. Despite this, his work has influenced many young British artists.<|eot_id|>"

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He didn't like farming, so he started working as a mechanic when he was 15 years old. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 km, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used a special type of steel to make affordable cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he created the Ford Model T, which cost $825. It became very popular, and soon he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million.

He famously said, 'You can have any color you like, as long as it's black,' about the Model T.

REBECCA STEVENS: THE FIRST WOMAN TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. Before she did it, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in London. In 1993, she decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with some other climbers. She found that climbing Everest was very challenging. 'You have to carry everything on your back,' she explained. 'So, you can only take what you really need.' There was no water on the mountain, so she didn't even take a toothbrush! When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. After that, she became famous. Now she has written a book about her adventure and often talks about it. She also has a new job on a science TV show. Rebecca is well-known today and has more money, but she still lives in her little flat in London, surrounded by her photos and books about mountains.

Bill had a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. During the summer, he took them on short flights, and the young geese flew behind him. When autumn came, Bill flew to Virginia, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. The next spring, Bill waited for the birds to return. But they didn't come back. So Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks, but couldn't find them. When he got back home, he found the geese waiting for him. They had learned to find their way back home without him!'

Stephen shears the wool every six months to keep the sheep cool. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters and tried to sell them at local markets, but it was summer and people didn't want to buy sweaters. So, she started making socks instead. They were a big hit because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business began. Initially, she made the socks at home, but as her customer base grew, she had to start sending the wool to a factory where machines produce the socks.

'Burglars often strike in the afternoon. According to the police, most burglaries happen between 2 pm and 6 pm. Inspector Ian Saunders says that the number of burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He also notes that 67% of burglaries occur when people forget to lock a door or window. In contrast, night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home. However, winter afternoons are a good time for burglars because it's dark and they can't be seen easily. Many houses are also empty during this time because people are still at work. Inspector Saunders recommends leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you're away on holiday. This can help deter burglars. He also suggests that neighbors keep an eye on each other's houses when people are not home and report any suspicious activity to the police. Inspector Saunders also promises to provide advice on how to make your house more secure, and this service is free.'

'Horse racing has a long history. It started in Central Asia over 4,500 years ago. The ancient Greeks and Romans loved horse racing. When Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century, modern horse racing began. Initially, races were long and only two horses participated. However, by the early 18th century, races became shorter and involved several horses. Today, horse racing is a popular sport, attracting more spectators than any other sport in the USA, except baseball. It is also widely enjoyed globally.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced complex vocabulary (e.g., ""it is clear that"" -> ""it has a long history"")
* Simplified sentence structures (e.g., combined two sentences into one)
* Removed unnecessary words and phrases (e.g., ""From the first history books ever written"")
* Changed some phrasing to make it more accessible (e.g., ""At first, races were long and between just two horses"" -> ""Initially, races were long and only two horses participated"")

Nick only packs a few clothes and always brings some books. His wife, Helen, is understanding and keeps busy while he's away. She likes to hear about his adventures when he returns. Sometimes, things can be difficult. Once, Nick was filming in the Malaysian rainforest when he heard his wife was ill in hospital.

'Parrots You may have seen these colorful birds with their long tails in the forest or in a zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They often live in big groups and because they love to eat fruit, they can sometimes cause problems for farmers. There are many types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet that help them climb and hold food. The largest parrots can live up to 80 years. They are very loud, but they are clever birds and can easily be taught to talk. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can see the birds performing tricks they have learned.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

Howard Bonnier Bray is a small village near London. Howard Bonnier, a 29-year-old Englishman, opened a restaurant called The Palace there three and a half months ago. Although not many people in the UK know him, he is well-known in France. This is because he has written about the best restaurants in France in French magazines. Howard often went to restaurants with his parents when he was a teenager. He loved it so much that he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many cookbooks in French and English. So, why did he open a restaurant? He loves cooking. Was it easy to open a restaurant? He says it's expensive and harder to cook for 50 people than for his family, but he thinks it was the right decision.

I made the following changes:

* Simplified vocabulary: replaced ""about fifty kilometres west of London"" with ""near London""
* Simplified sentence structure: combined some sentences and rephrased others to make them easier to understand
* Reduced the number of complex vocabulary words: replaced ""almost all"" with ""many"", ""instead"" with ""so"", and ""he says he has more than two hundred and fifty"" with ""he has many""

John Pickering is a gardener in a small town in central England. He spends his days cutting grass and watering flowers. But last week, he was in Tokyo, Japan, and millions of people watched him on TV. You see, John is a famous singer in Japan, known as Jon Otis. He visited Japan a few months ago to perform in clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A DJ heard his music and played it on his radio show. Hundreds of young people called the radio station and asked to hear his songs again. Despite being a famous singer, John still works as a gardener in England. He's not sure how much money he'll make from his music. 'I have to keep my job in the park,' he says. 'I still have bills to pay!' John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, is surprised by his fame. 'This won't change our lifestyle,' she says. 'I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!'

* Shortened sentences: I combined some sentences to make them shorter and easier to understand.
* Removed complex sentence structures: I rephrased sentences to avoid complex sentence structures and focus on simple, clear sentences.

Many people in Britain have started a new hobby - line dancing. You can find clubs and classes in almost every town. Fiona Lever, a teacher, says that line dancing is easy to learn.

'THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE

In the past, London didn't have a police force. A few old men used to look after the streets at night, but they weren't paid much. London was a big city with many poor people and a lot of crime. People were afraid to go out at night because of thieves. In 1750, a man named Henry Fielding started paying a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called the Bow Street Runners. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London was getting even bigger and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was created with 3000 officers. Most of them walked, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police are well paid, and police officers who still ride horses get paid even more.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary: I replaced words like ""very dirty"" with ""big"" and ""poor"" with ""many poor people"".

During this time, the streets are filled with music and dance from morning to night. You can even watch artists painting on the streets. One of the highlights is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small halls and cafes. Many tourists come to the Festival to see new films, plays, and music performances by famous musicians. This year, you can see over 500 performances featuring actors from more than 40 countries. Tickets are affordable, and it's often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, come to Edinburgh next summer, but don't forget to book your hotel in advance, as rooms can be hard to find!'

'You need warm and light clothing,' he says. 'Wear two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. It's easy to catch fish here.' He explains, 'First, you break the ice and make a small hole. Then you put a fishing line with some bread on it into the hole. When the fish eat the bread, pull the line up. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people eat them, but I prefer to have a snack like chocolate after catching a few. Today, I caught twenty-five!

Later, when bicycles became more affordable, many people started buying them. People used bicycles for both commuting to work and leisure activities.

The trainers gave them new paintbrushes and took the old ones away. The elephants painted pictures following the trainers' instructions. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture was of a river, one of a tree, and one of a bunch of flowers. When the trainers showed us the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at level B2 CEFR:

'Otters Few people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim at speeds of over 10 kilometres per hour. They have thick brown fur, which keeps them warm in the water. Otters can also close their ears and nose, allowing them to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were heavily polluted, and many fish and insects died. As a result, otters struggled to find food. However, thanks to efforts to clean the rivers, there is now plenty of food available for them.'

Dear Deshini,

I'm excited to be your penfriend! My name is Tom and I'm 15 years old. I was born in Canada, but I now live in England. I'm really interested in learning about your life in India. What's it like living there? Do you live in a small village or a big city? What's your school like? Do you have any photos of your school that you could send me? I'd love to see them!

I'm sending you a few photos of my family. I'll send more next time I write. I hope you'll write to me soon.

Dear Carlos,

I'm excited to tell you that I'm planning to visit your country next month with two friends. We're having trouble finding a place to stay in the city centre. Are there any affordable hotels in your town? We would like to be close to the main attractions.

Could you help us out?

Best regards,
David

Dear David,

I'm happy to help. Unfortunately, hotels in the city centre can be quite expensive. But I have some good news! I talked to my aunt Gloria and she's kindly offered for you and your friends to stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my own house, so it should be comfortable for all of you. Would that be okay with you?

'Building and Architecture

Humans have built structures for thousands of years. We need houses to shelter us from the elements and stadiums to host events like football matches and concerts. Museums are used to display valuable and beautiful objects. Construction projects often involve many people working together. The architect designs the building's appearance and creates drawings to illustrate their ideas. Engineers ensure the building is sturdy and secure. Then, workers carefully construct it. The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a striking roof. What's impressive about this building is that it's beautiful from all angles, not just from above. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also features a famous roof, which resembles a transparent tent.'

Gail Rollins is a well-known runner from Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run in the 10,000 and 5,000 meter races at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was often second in big competitions, but she always smiled and laughed about it. People in her hometown love her for her positive attitude. However, everything changed in 2004 when she won her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She finished in a very good time, the fastest for any British woman runner that year. Gail's husband and manager, Mike Rollins, used to be a runner too, but he had to stop due to an injury. Now, he sometimes runs with Gail, but she always leaves him behind. Gail trains hard. She goes for a long run in the morning and then does some fast runs in the afternoon. She takes a rest from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I'm with her all the time.

Every day, he goes to his office and writes. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me if she doesn't like something,' says Bill. His 10 grandchildren, who don't live nearby, also read his stories and give him feedback. This helps Bill understand what children want to read. He writes about life in his village and on the nearby farms. His favourite book is the fifth one, The Sheepdog, which is about a farmer and his clever dog. 'I've always liked animals, and dogs are very smart,' says Bill. Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors.

We're not looking forward to leaving.
