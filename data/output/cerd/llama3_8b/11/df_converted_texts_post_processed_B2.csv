'Charging for household waste: a complex issue
In many developed countries, people do not pay for taking out the trash. But is this really a good idea? Economists think not. The cost of collecting and disposing of waste is not zero. The more waste we produce, the more we need to pay for waste collectors and trucks. So, making households pay for their waste might encourage them to produce less and recycle more.
Some towns and cities have tried this approach. For example, in Charlottesville, Virginia, residents were charged 80 cents for each bag of waste. This might seem like a good idea, but the results were not as expected. People did produce less waste, but they also found ways to put more waste in each bag. This made it harder and more expensive to collect and dispose of the waste.
The study also found that some people started dumping their waste illegally instead of paying for it. This is a problem because it's hard to measure. The only positive result was that people recycled a bit more, but this might have been happening anyway.
The researchers also looked at the impact of price increases on waste production. They found that a 10% increase in the cost of waste bags only reduced waste by 0.3%. This means that making people pay a little more for their waste might not make a big difference.
So, is charging for household waste a good idea? It's not that simple. The effects of these policies can be complex and hard to understand. We need to consider many factors, including income and education, to make sense of the results.'

'Work and happiness. Are you satisfied with your job? Many people are not. They feel unappreciated and undervalued. Even those who have achieved success often feel unhappy. Loving your work used to be enough, but now it's not enough. You need to ask yourself if your job is good for you as a person. Are you able to talk to people outside your profession? Do you have time to learn new things and have fun? If not, no amount of money or status can make up for it.
I'm trying to find ways to make work more fulfilling. Instead of just doing a job for money, we should do it because it makes us happy and fulfilled. We need to rethink what we mean by 'work' and what it means to be a human being.
Many people are unhappy in their jobs. Even those in high-status professions like doctors and accountants often feel stressed and unhappy. Architects and administrators often feel trapped by their work. Only a few people feel truly fulfilled in their jobs.
I'm investigating different jobs to see how they affect people. I'm looking at how different cultures have valued work and how we can make work more meaningful. I'm also looking at how we can make our work more like a work of art, with the person at the centre.
For example, hotels could be more than just a place to sleep. They could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel workers could be more than just servants. They could be hosts who bring people together.
Work is a relationship. We need to rethink what we mean by 'work' and how we do it. We need to give people the chance to design their own jobs and choose their own colleagues and customers. We need to learn to communicate with each other in a more meaningful way. This is the key to happiness and fulfillment.'

'Broadcasting: How a Technology Was Shaped by Society
The word ""broadcasting"" originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand. This metaphor is not just about agriculture, but also about modernism. It's about planned growth and the possibility of a rich harvest. The idea assumes a central location with resources for spreading and reproduction.
We want to know why a new technology that sent words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor. Television, as a technology, is related to other two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone. It's surprising that, from its early days, television was seen as a centralized ""mass"" medium. This was in line with social and economic structures and the way people lived in modern societies.
There were some experiments with alternative forms of organization, but they didn't succeed. In the 1930s, some people in Britain experimented with two-way television as an alternative to the phone. They even published articles on how to build transmitters and receivers. However, big business and the government intervened and set standards for television equipment, which made it difficult for these grassroots efforts to continue.
Television was also seen as a way to compete with the film industry in the United States. In many countries, people watched TV in public settings, not just at home. In Britain, for example, most people watched TV in public places.
Despite some alternative ideas, television was largely organized around central broadcasting to individual homes. This was because manufacturers wanted to sell sets to as many people as possible, and people wanted to have TV in their homes. As people's living standards improved and they entered consumer society, they wanted to have entertainment and cultural experiences at home.
There is a connection between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting. As societies became more modern, they became more centralized, and people became more isolated. Centralized broadcasting was a way for governments to reach people efficiently and create a sense of national identity.
The text also mentions the importance of broadcasting in promoting democracy and equal access to information. However, the term ""broadcasting"" might become outdated as technology changes.'

'Clutter Sometimes, having many possessions doesn't make us feel secure. It's natural to want a home that meets our needs, but there's a point where we start to buy things for the wrong reasons. Advertisers use our insecurities to sell us things. They make us feel like we need something if we don't have it. To see how much advertising affects us, try not to look at billboards the next time you're out. They are very persuasive and can influence us without us even realizing it.
We're constantly surrounded by advertisements on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the internet, all telling us to buy more. On the other hand, caves have been studied by scientists and researchers around the world. They're a fascinating part of nature that sparks our curiosity and encourages us to learn more. Because caves are a natural part of our environment, people have been studying them for a long time.
However, visiting caves can be challenging, which means that not many experts have been able to study them. Instead, both professionals and amateur cavers have contributed to our understanding of caves.
Weather forecasting has a long history, dating back to the 17th century. We now have advanced technology that helps us predict the weather quickly and accurately. However, human experience and observations are still essential for making accurate weather forecasts.

'Opera and Theatre: A Different Perspective
I used to think that opera is primarily a form of theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first. This makes sense, as music is the foundation of opera. However, I come from a theatre background, where the spoken word is central and the audience and performers share a common language. In contrast, music performances often feature a minority of people who don't understand music, while the majority are impressed by the skill of the performers.
In music, audiences are often awed by the technical skill of the performers, just like watching an athlete in action. In theatre, audiences are more familiar with the performance and may not be as impressed by the actor's skill. This doesn't mean that theatre audiences are less demanding or less appreciative; they simply have different expectations.
I believe that music can learn from theatre in terms of building a connection with the audience. Music performances can be more engaging and immersive, like a theatrical experience. The conventions of music presentation, such as formal dress codes and deference to conductors, can create a sense of hierarchy. On the other hand, interrupting the performance with applause can disrupt the overall experience.
There are many initiatives to encourage new audiences to attend concerts and operas, and to break down barriers that make people feel music is not for them. I recall a remarkable community opera production that involved the audience in the performance. This type of innovative approach can lead to a more immersive and life-changing experience.
What I would like to see in music is a bit more experimentation and risk-taking, similar to what happens in theatre. This can involve using unconventional locations or formats, which can be challenging but also lead to exciting and memorable experiences. I believe that both music and theatre can thrive and bring joy to more people if we can find ways to bridge the gap between the two.'"

'I'm not a big fan of sand in its natural state. It's a barrier that gets in the way and makes a mess. When you're at the beach, it blows in your face, gets in your food, and swallows small objects. When it's wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step onto a towel or a carpet, it suddenly falls off. Sand is very persistent and can stay with you for a long time. I'm not a fan of sand, to be honest.
The search for a safe and secure home has been going on for a long time. People want to feel safe and protected. The idea of a lock and key is comforting. Recently, some companies have developed electronic locking systems, but people prefer the old-fashioned way of using a physical key. When a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they added a metal key to make it more appealing.
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern art gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some of it, but I'm not sure what it's all about. The idea is to let the art communicate with you, not to try to understand every detail. The new gallery provides information about the art, which helps visitors understand what the artists were trying to say. The labels explain the context and meaning of the works, which makes it easier to appreciate the art.'

""Every Picture Tells a Story
When we adapt a novel into a film, we have to make some changes. We have to remove some parts and make it shorter. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be interesting. When I worked on a script, I was surprised by how much I could remove from the original novel without losing the main idea. This doesn't mean that the original parts were unnecessary. It's just that the way we present information is different in books and films.
In a book, we can include more details to help the reader understand the characters and the story. In a film, we can show the characters and the story more directly. We don't need to include as much extra information.
Watching Movies
Going to the cinema is a special experience. It's like being transported to a different world. We can forget about our everyday problems and just enjoy the film. But when the lights come back on, we're back in the real world.
Some people used to think that movies were just entertainment, not a serious art form. But now many people consider film-making to be a serious art.
The Film Studios
The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing place. There were many different buildings, and it was hard to find your way around. The studios didn't make it easy for visitors to find their way. But the people who worked there knew their way around.
Many people want to make movies. There are many books and courses to help them learn how to do it. Some people even make successful films with very little money. For example, Robert Rodriguez made a film called El Mariachi for just $7,000. He became a famous director as a result.""

In the past, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. They were old and not very nice. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from a nearby factory would spread around the houses and gardens. People would often complain about the smell.
I don't remember much about my childhood, but I do remember sitting by the window and looking at the houses going away into the distance. I also remember my mother doing ironing in the back room of a house that wasn't ours.
My mother was a small, strict woman who was often angry. I never understood why she was angry, and I couldn't make her happy. Even when I was a child, I knew she was a bit strange. She was very alone, even when she was with other people. She had her own rules, which she followed very strictly. For example, she would get very upset if I walked on someone else's garden or if I didn't sit still for a long time.
My mother had some friends, but they were not very nice. They would talk about boring things like the weather and how difficult it was to take care of their children. I didn't like being around them.
Growing up in West Earlham was very routine. Until I was five, I just stayed at home and played with my toys. Then, I started going to school. The lucky kids had a bike with a seat for their child, but my mother didn't have one. Instead, she would ask other kids in the street to take care of me on the way to school.
The summer holidays were the best time. I would see the world outside West Earlham, like an old man who told stories about his time in the navy or a charity event where I got lemonade and tried to learn about a charity. But my mother didn't like these things. She thought people were only doing them for money.
My mother didn't like politicians and thought they were all corrupt. She would often talk about how they were only in it for the money. I think she was a bit unfair, but I also think she was very strict and didn't have much kindness in her.
Sometimes, my mother would take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at the paintings. She wasn't very interested, but she would try to make a joke sometimes. I remember one time she said, ""I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" when we saw a painting of a Roman soldier.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The sun was setting, and the air was humid and misty, making my walk feel secretive. I knew this street well from my childhood. I used to play with my friends who lived in the houses here. The houses were all different, with their own unique features, like the small gutters that led rainwater from the roofs to the sidewalk. As the street sloped downward, the houses became smaller and the yards got smaller too. Over the years, some houses that were once homes became shops, and some shops became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these spaces, especially those that used to be stores.
I visited the home of a furniture designer, Rick Gilbert, who lives in a former curtain warehouse. He wanted a cozy space, not an open-plan one, so he put up a wall made of corrugated plastic to separate his office from the rest of the flat. He also added a kitchen in the middle of the flat, which is a neutral zone where he can cook for friends or work with clients. To make the space feel more homely, he added some wooden floors and furniture given to him by his parents.
Bruce Chatwin was a famous writer who traveled a lot and wrote about his adventures. His book, In Patagonia, is a classic travel book that is full of imagination and romance. However, Chatwin often mixed fact and fiction in his writing, so it's hard to know what's true and what's not.
One summer, I went swimming in my pool during a heavy rainstorm. The raindrops created little fountains on the water, and I loved watching them burst and disappear. It was then that I had the idea to swim through Britain, following the rain and the rivers to the sea. I wanted to break free from the routine of swimming laps and explore the wild side of Britain.
Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, but walking, cycling, and swimming allow us to experience the unknown and the wild. A swimming journey would give me a chance to explore the unknown parts of Britain and regain a sense of wonder and adventure.

Here's a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the B2 level:
'Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no obvious reason. However, scientists have found that crying plays an important role in our social lives. For example, a psychiatrist named John Bowlby discovered that crying helps develop the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that children cry mainly because they feel helpless. But why do adults still cry? The sound of crying is less important than the way it looks. It's possible that crying helped early human communities to build trust and feel connected to each other. We may also cry to show sympathy for people who are suffering unfairly. Sometimes we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. We might cry when watching a sad movie, and interestingly, this is more likely to happen when we're with others than when we're alone. The importance of crying in our social lives seems clear, but scientists are still studying this topic.'

**The Heat is On: Understanding Global Warming**
Global warming is a well-known issue, but how much warmer will the Earth get and how will it affect our lives? Most people have a general idea of what global warming is, but few know exactly what will happen. A warmer climate will change the weather all over the world. Since the atmosphere affects everything on our planet, any changes to the climate will have big effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support our population. Any changes to these resources are serious. The problem is that we don't know exactly how the world will change and what's causing these changes. We do know that human actions have increased the concentration of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These increased concentrations are likely to continue and are already affecting the climate.
Scientists have been studying the relationship between atmospheric gases and temperature. They have found that the Earth has warmed by about 6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe that this warming is not natural and is partly caused by human pollution.
To predict the future, scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These programs use physical and chemical laws to analyze temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, these models are not perfect and have limitations.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we've experienced before. The models suggest that the Earth's temperature will rise by 1-3.5°C by 2100, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts will become more frequent in some areas.
Climate change will affect the environment and human societies. It could change the location of ecosystems, the mix of species, and their ability to provide benefits. This will impact food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some areas will experience negative effects, while others might benefit.
For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have led to an increase in wheat production. However, many predicted effects of climate change will be negative. Small changes in climate can affect water availability, leading to droughts and water shortages. This will be a problem in areas where water is already scarce.
Climate change will also affect glaciers, sea ice, and ice sheets, which will impact vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. The Arctic's ice cover may even melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.
The most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the expansion of warmer water and the melting of ice. With many people living in coastal areas, the consequences of rising sea levels will be severe, including flooding, inundation, and displacement of people. This could lead to millions of environmental refugees.
The consequences of climate change will be devastating, not only for the people and culture of small island nations but also for the countries that will need to accommodate those who have been displaced."

The existence of works of art can actually make it harder to understand them. This is because these works are physical objects that exist independently of our experience of them. We often think of a work of art as a building, book, painting, or statue that exists separately from the way it affects us. However, the true value of a work of art lies in its impact on our experience. Moreover, the fact that some works of art have been widely admired for a long time can create conventions that make it difficult to see them in a new light. When a work of art becomes famous, it can become isolated from the circumstances in which it was created and the way it affects people's lives. This can make it hard to understand its significance.
The task of art theorists is to bridge the gap between the refined and intense experiences that art provides and the everyday events, activities, and struggles that make up our lives. This is not an easy task, as we often separate art from the rest of our experiences and achievements.
In order to understand art, we need to consider the ordinary forces and conditions that shape our experiences. We need to look at the way art is connected to the world around us, rather than just focusing on the art itself. This might seem surprising, but it's true. To understand the meaning of a work of art, we need to forget about it for a while and look at the ordinary things that make up our lives.
It's possible to enjoy art without understanding it, just as we can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants. But if we want to understand the art, we need to start with the raw materials that shape our experiences. We need to look at the events and scenes that capture our attention and evoke our emotions.
Many people enjoy things that they don't consider to be art, such as movies, jazz, or comic strips. This is because they provide an outlet for our natural desire to experience enjoyable things. However, many people who criticize the traditional notion of art still share the same mistake. They separate art from the ordinary experiences of life, just like the traditional notion of art does. The times when art is closely connected to everyday life are the times when people appreciate it most.

However, after studying lions for many years, we have a different view. We wanted to know why lions hunt together, care for their young, and scare off rivals. It seemed that if an animal is too helpful, others may take advantage of it. So, why don't lions follow this rule?

When we submit our manuscripts, they often go to a pile of unsorted papers, known as the slush pile. A junior editor or an experienced editor will review our work, looking for something original. If they like our work, they will pass it on to a more senior editor. The senior editor will decide whether to accept our work based on its quality and potential sales. They will also consider whether we are a promising author and whether we can promote our work well."

Advertising in Trouble
The early 1990s were a challenging time for people who worked in advertising agencies. The economy was going through a recession, which meant that many companies were not making as much money as they used to. This made it difficult for advertising agencies to get the budget they needed to do their job.
In 1991, the situation was particularly bad in the UK. The economy was declining, interest rates were high, and many people lost their jobs. The construction and car industries were hit hard, with a 30% decline in sales. Advertising agencies were not immune to these problems and many people in the industry lost their jobs.
Those who remained in the industry felt under a lot of pressure. They were expected to do more with less, which meant coming up with creative ideas on a smaller budget. At the same time, companies were becoming more demanding, wanting to see better results from their advertising campaigns.
The recession also made companies question the effectiveness of advertising. They wanted to know what they were getting for their money and whether it was worth the cost. This put a lot of pressure on advertising agencies to prove their worth.
In addition to the economic challenges, the industry was also facing other difficulties. There were changes in demographics, the rise of retailers, and changing consumer needs and desires. All these factors made it harder for advertising agencies to produce effective campaigns.
As a result, many people in the industry were struggling to do their job well. They were under pressure to come up with creative ideas on a smaller budget and to prove the effectiveness of their campaigns. This was a challenging time for the advertising industry, and it required a lot of hard work and creativity to succeed.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, but it has a long history. Historians of fashion believe that fashion, in the sense of style and design, has been around for a long time. They think that the rise of trade and commerce in the 16th and 17th centuries was a key moment in the development of fashion. As societies become more complex, people's needs and tastes change, and new ways of making clothes and accessories are discovered. This means that the meaning of different clothes and accessories can be different for different people and in different situations. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.
As for writers, it's not always easy to make a living. Some writers have other jobs to support themselves, while others, like me, do odd jobs to make ends meet.

However, many writers manage to write by juggling part-time jobs and using credit cards, and sometimes they even get help from other writers.

'Music in the Future
Technology is changing the way we live, work, and have fun. This includes music. In the past, we had more opportunities to listen to music on the radio, TV, records, and CDs. However, there was a decline in live music performances and jobs for professional musicians.
In the future, music will continue to be an important part of our lives. We will have more opportunities to listen to music, and people will be able to make their own music using technology. This could lead to a wider range of musical styles and genres.
Music is also good for us. Research has shown that playing a musical instrument can improve our spatial reasoning and social skills. It can also help us develop good study habits and concentration.
In the short term, there will be a continued demand for music lessons. In the long term, there may be a shift in focus. People may want to listen to more diverse music and use technology to create their own music. This could lead to a decline in the need for live performances by professional musicians.
To prepare for this future, music teachers will need to adapt their teaching methods. They will need to teach people of all ages how to play a range of instruments and develop their musical skills. Musicians will also need to learn how to work with large groups, communicate effectively, and manage their time.
It is important for the music profession to work together to raise the profile of music and show the public the value of music education. Music plays a big role in our lives, but it is often taken for granted.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level B2 (CEFR):
Actors often face criticism and dislike. Sometimes, they themselves contribute to this by talking too much about their work and themselves in interviews. They should remember what the famous dancer Pavlova said: ""If I could explain it, I wouldn't do it."" Instead, they often use clichés, truisms, or gossip. The famous actor Paul Scofield once wrote: ""An actor's work has life and interest only when they are performing. It becomes empty and theoretical when they talk about it."" He believes that an actor should start from scratch with each new play, learning and growing with the characters and the writer.
Adrian Lester's performance in Hamlet is impressive. He plays a young man who is struggling to find his place in the world. His acting is confident and natural, and he brings a sense of humor to the role. He is able to convey a sense of anger and frustration, but also of vulnerability.
What is acting? Is it imitating someone or bringing them to life? Who or what makes these characters come alive? This is the central question of the theatre.
One director's approach to rehearsal is to have the actors sit quietly while someone else speaks, and then think about what the words mean to them. They look at the script, visualize the scene, and find the reason to speak. This director calls this process ""dropping in"".
The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence has made a difference. The staff should have a sense of this too. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. The proportions of the auditorium are important, as they should respond to the human voice and body. The theatre should have a sense of history and human presence.
It's impossible to please everyone with every play. You can't guess what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to be surprised and experience something new.

In the 1950s, rock and roll music was mainly popular among young people, but it had a big impact on the middle class and older adults as well. It paved the way for the next generation of rock stars. For Paul Simon, listening to rock and roll on the radio was a big deal. He heard it on a show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, hosted by Alan Freed. This show was very popular among young people who wanted to listen to rock and roll music. Paul Simon was fascinated by the music and wanted to make his own music. He didn't know how to start, but he thought he could figure it out if he was careful.

**Screen Learning**
Recently, I noticed my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while pretending to be a dinosaur. I asked him about dinosaurs, but he didn't know much. This made me think about whether learning from screens is effective. One writer tried an interactive programme with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The writer thought his son might have learned more if they had read a book together.
**Television and Learning**
Research shows that learning happens best when there is dialogue with a teacher or parent. Screens can be useful, but they shouldn't replace formal education. My son's dinosaur game is an example of how screens can be used in a playful way.
**Hollywood**
Hollywood has changed a lot since 1918. Back then, most film-making companies moved to Hollywood from other places. Some people didn't like the new film-makers, but they eventually accepted them because they were successful. Today, Hollywood is famous for making popular movies that make a lot of money.
**Photography**
Photography was invented by artists who wanted to create lasting images. They used a combination of light, lenses, and chemicals to produce pictures that were more realistic and detailed than paintings. Some artists didn't think photography was a real art form, but photographers knew they had created something new and important.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, it was common to include illustrations in children's books. Some of these illustrations are still valuable today. We can learn a lot from looking at these old books and the artists who created them.
I made minor changes to the text to make it more accessible to learners of level B2, while keeping the main ideas and factual content intact. I:
1. Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary.
2. Removed complex sentences and phrases.
3. Added transitional words and phrases to connect ideas.
4. Changed some technical terms to more accessible language.
5. Removed examples and anecdotes that were not essential to the main ideas.
The resulting text should be more readable and understandable for learners of level B2, while still conveying the same information as the original text."

'Blogging: Sharing with the World
Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of sharing your location online. The site said that when you post about where you are, you're not just telling your friends - you're also telling everyone else, including people you might not want to meet. This idea fits with the growing concern that there are downsides to sharing our lives online.
The internet offers many opportunities to share our thoughts, photos, and stories with a huge audience. We might think that this will bring us wealth, fame, or new friends. But often, we realize too late that the internet is a crowded and complicated place, and we're not sure how to navigate it.
Luckily, some people have been where we are now. In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers started sharing their lives online. They faced many challenges, including getting fired, losing friends, and dealing with the temptations of fame. These pioneers, who we now call bloggers, have already learned many lessons that we can learn from.
One of these pioneers is Justin Hall, who started posting on the internet in 1994. He shared his life, including photos and art, and built a large following. But he also faced challenges, including losing his job and dealing with the consequences of sharing too much.
Another example is Heather Armstrong, who started a blog in 2002. She wrote about her job and her personal life, but her blog was discovered by her boss and colleagues, and she lost her job. This experience taught her an important lesson: just because we can say anything online, it doesn't mean we should.
Heather's story shows that we need to be careful about what we share online and how we present ourselves. We can still share our thoughts and experiences, but we need to do it in a way that respects our relationships and ourselves.'

Sleep is a big problem in modern society. Many people don't get enough sleep, and this is affecting their daily lives. In the United States, 40 million people suffer from chronic sleep deprivation. Some famous novels have even featured characters who struggle with sleep. 
Researchers are studying sleep to understand why people need it and how they can get better sleep. One researcher tried an experiment where he let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. The results showed that people need around 8-9 hours of sleep each night.
In the UK, there is a sleep research laboratory at a university that studies sleep patterns. They investigate how sleep affects people in different situations, such as when they are tired or when they are driving. The researchers use special equipment to monitor people's brain activity and body movements while they sleep.
One study found that people who don't get enough sleep are more likely to fall asleep while driving. In fact, two cups of coffee can help people stay awake for up to 30 minutes after not sleeping at all. The researchers recommend using alertness products, such as energy drinks or caffeinated gum, to help people stay awake.
There are some things that scientists are certain about when it comes to sleep. For example, humans sleep in a daily cycle, and they switch between different stages of sleep. During the lightest stage of sleep, the brain paralyses the body to prevent injuries.
However, there is still a lot that scientists don't know about sleep. They are not sure what exactly happens during sleep, but they do know that women sleep for about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep.
Some researchers believe that sleep is important for the body to repair itself, but this is still a theory. Others think that sleep helps people to rest their brains and recover from the stresses of the day.
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. In the 17th century, people used to have two periods of sleep, with a break in between to relax and think. This was especially common among the poor, who used the quiet time to rest and reflect.
In some parts of the world, people still don't have a fixed bedtime. They may sleep for a few hours and then wake up again. This is because they may need to watch out for predators or tend to fires at night.
Overall, it seems that people all over the world need to pay more attention to their sleep patterns."

I wore a cowboy outfit, including $800 designer boots, in the Arizona desert. I felt like a real cowboy, but I wasn't one. I flew in from Denver and felt out of place. The first real cowboy I met at the airport didn't even look at me. I used to be a racing driver, but I'm not anymore. I loved it, but it's hard to find a new job when you're used to being in the spotlight. I thought about becoming a TV commentator or selling classic cars, but neither worked out. Now I'm an ""ex-racing driver"" and it's tough. I miss the thrill of racing and the attention that came with it. Now I have a lot of free time, but I'm not sure what to do with it. As I looked at the desert landscape, I realized that even the birds were giving me advice: ""Get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out."" It made me think that I, a fake cowboy, had a lot to learn.

'Vancouver, a city in western Canada, has become a popular place for people from all over the world to live. In the evenings, people stroll through the city's streets and you can hear different languages being spoken almost everywhere. Many people come to Vancouver because of its mild climate, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, and good education and job opportunities. The city has changed a lot in recent years, with new buildings and a growing tourism industry. Some people might complain about the rapid growth, but it's clear that the new arrivals and tourists have helped make the city more vibrant.
Journalists are not good at writing letters, it seems. They often struggle to write something that is not going to be paid for. This might be because they are always trying to make their writing as effective as possible, which makes it hard to be spontaneous. The best artists, on the other hand, don't think about the effect of their work, but just let their creativity flow. This is what makes them truly talented.
In the past, the opening of a new supermarket was a big event in Britain. Celebrities like soap stars and disc jockeys would come to cut the ribbon. Now, with new supermarkets opening all the time, it's not worth paying celebrities to do it. Last week, a new branch of Superbuy opened and the first five people in the door got a free gift - a bottle of aftershave for the men and flowers for the women. This news spread quickly and made those who got there early feel proud, while those who arrived later felt a bit jealous.'

""Citizen Kane: A Film Classic
When Citizen Kane was finally released in 1941, it received great reviews, but it was not a commercial success at first. It was only later, with the help of television, that it became well-known again. This film is often credited with inspiring people to become filmmakers. It's surprising, considering it was Orson Welles's first film.
Welles always said that the film's success was because he didn't know what he was or wasn't allowed to do, so he just went ahead and did it. He had a great team working with him, including a talented cameraman, screenwriter, and special effects expert.
The idea for the film came from Welles and his screenwriter, Herman J. Mankiewicz. They decided to create a character who was a newspaper magnate, similar to William Randolph Hearst. Welles realized that this was the perfect opportunity for him to both direct and act in the film.
In the film, we see a character named Dermot, who is worried about being late for a golf game. His wife, Carmel, is also worried, but she is more concerned about not doing anything with her day. She decides to go for a walk and look at the shops.
Now, let's talk about job titles. A recent study found that job titles can cause envy and conflict in the workplace. The study showed that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers would rather have a more impressive job title than a pay rise. This shows that people are very concerned about their status and labels.""

I went to Vienna to take photographs. It was my job to capture the beauty of the city. I loved the way the light fell on the buildings and the way a single picture could capture the essence of a moment. I believed that the perfect photograph was always just a second away, as long as I had film in my camera. I'd been a photographer for a long time, and I'd had some success. Once, a picture of a burning oil well caught the attention of newspapers and magazines all over the world. It was a lucky break, but I believed that you make your own luck, good and bad.
After that, I started working freelance, which seemed like a good idea at the time. But life had other plans. The mid-1990s weren't as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than in a more exciting location. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it.
The assignment in Vienna was a bit of a surprise. I had already taken pictures in London, Paris, and Rome for a coffee-table book called Four Cities in Four Seasons. But then the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, quit the job in Vienna, and they asked me to take his place. I was free and available, so I agreed. The publishers liked my work, and I was glad to go.
I stayed at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before, but it was different this time. I was alone, and I had time to really look at the city. I took a tram ride around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased. The weather was cold and grey, like the city's baroque architecture.
I didn't take any pictures on the first day. I just looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn to take pictures of Stephansplatz. The snow had fallen overnight, and the square was deserted and white. I didn't know how to capture the whole cathedral in one shot, but I was happy to settle for a partial view. It was magical, and I felt like I was a part of something special.
Photography has always been magical to me. Even when you know how it works, you still feel a sense of wonder. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz didn't surprise me. It's a feeling that stays with you forever."

The Hayward Gallery in London has been transformed into a fascinating exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is a type of art that involves movement or explores the idea of movement. The exhibition shows how this type of art has been a consistent theme in the creative work of many artists over the past 60 years. The curator, Guy Brett, has brought together a wide range of artworks, including paintings, drawings, documents, and films, without using too much text to explain them. Visitors are free to make their own connections and discoveries.
Some people enjoy the art of David Hockney because it is figurative and easy to understand. Others might like his personality or the way he is portrayed in the media. However, some critics think that Hockney's art is not very good. But Hockney himself knows that his art is popular and doesn't worry about what others think.
As a curator, I have seen many art exhibitions that try to make a point or follow a specific theme. I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists to create an exhibition called ""Window-shopping"", where each artist showed their own work without any connection to the others. The artworks were very different, but they didn't interfere with each other, and some even complemented each other.
Some people think that art historians focus too much on theory and ignore the pleasure of looking at art. However, knowing more about an artwork can actually enhance our pleasure. Our enjoyment of art is influenced by the values of the society we live in.

'Metals
A long time ago, people might have started to be interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for fish to come close, and finding a shiny yellow stone. It didn't feel like a normal stone, so they might have picked it up. This could be how gold was first discovered. Because gold is soft, people soon wanted to use it a lot. Copper might have been found by accident, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they started to look for copper and ways to get it out of the ground. This is how metalworking became an important part of people's lives.
St Ives
As we walked down the narrow, cobblestone street to the center of town, the strong wind and rain made it hard to walk upright. The streets were empty, and all the shutters on the houses by the sea were closed tight. We had seen the weather getting worse as we arrived in St Ives by train. Coming to Cornwall without a car in the off-season didn't seem like such a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising walks along the beautiful coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
Computer Modelling
The problem with studying the past is that it's gone. The people who lived in good times and bad are dead. The reasons why they moved or stayed in certain places, formed families and communities, have disappeared. Archaeologists can find clues, but we can't test our ideas by experimenting on living or dead cultures. We can't rewind time and watch what happened. Or can we? Computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and environments and create virtual communities with some of the same needs and abilities as real people. We can set rules for how they behave and create social groups. Then we can change the weather or the number of people and see how the virtual community reacts.'

Vervet Monkeys
In a group of vervet monkeys, a dominant male noticed a stranger lurking in a nearby tree. The stranger was trying to join the group, which would mean the dominant male would lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to cross the open ground to reach the group, the dominant male gave an alarm call, warning the group of a leopard nearby. The stranger would quickly retreat back to the safety of the trees. This happened several times until the stranger made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while walking across the open ground himself. The dominant male had successfully kept the stranger away.
Cats
In a small English village, people collected data on their cats' hunting habits. Over one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America used these figures to estimate that cats in Britain kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate. Most cats in Britain live in towns and have small territories, and they catch fewer prey than the cats in the village. The key question is whether the number of prey caught by these cats is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people in Britain feed birds, and garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, keeping the bird population high.
Buffalo's Day
In a marshy area, buffalo live with their owners. Every morning, they slowly make their way to the distant reed beds. They groan and complain about the long day ahead. Once in the water, they become lethargic and may spend minutes wallowing and complaining. They eventually swim away, their eyes indicating they are tired and may be drowning. They spend the day grazing on green shoots, their antediluvian heads held high.
Picasso's Painting
Pablo Picasso painted a still life of a fishmonger's slab with a crab and scales. The fish look very much alive, but the painting is not easy to read.

However, the painting also has an undercurrent of menace and violence, as if the fish and crab are about to fight."

Here is the simplified version of the text, suitable for a B2 level learner of English:
Photography has been used to record many aspects of human life and activity for over a century and a half. During this time, photography has become more advanced in recording time and space, allowing us to see things that are happening at the same moment or things that are very small or very far away. It has brought us images from all over the world, including distant parts of the solar system, and has shown us the complexities and challenges of modern life.
Photography has also been used to record events in the past, with the earliest forms of pictorial recording dating back to around 35,000 years ago. These early images may have been used to record events, to encourage people to hunt, or to decorate homes. Throughout history, people have questioned the accuracy of visual images and their place in society.
When photography was invented in the 19th century, it was seen as a way to provide a truthful record of events. The camera was considered a machine that could capture an image that was very close to what we actually see. This idea was important because it was thought that all people would be able to understand photographs, regardless of their culture or language.
However, as global communication has increased, we have realized that photographs can be understood differently by people from different cultures. This has made us question whether photography is a universal language. Photographs are often used to convey important messages, but they can also be influenced by cultural norms and biases.
Photography has changed a lot since it was first invented, and its role has shifted from being a way to record events to being a way to convey messages and tell stories. Photographs can be used to promote social and political change, just like other forms of art and media. For example, photography played a key role in the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance, and it continues to shape our media culture today.

**Writing Poetry and Other Forms of Writing**
Writing poetry, short stories, and screenplays can be a challenging task. To begin, it's essential to read widely and often, and to keep writing regularly. Don't worry too much about following rules; just let your imagination flow. Some people need a stable life before they can write, while others can write even in difficult times. The key is to find your own rhythm and style.
**Short Stories**
When writing a short story, keep it simple and concise. Avoid too many characters, long descriptions, or unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used to help the reader understand the story better. Dialogue is a great way to reveal different perspectives and keep the reader interested.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves carefully. The more you write, the more you'll understand the game. It's not just about individual moves, but about the overall strategy.
**Language and Writing**
Language is an instinctive part of human nature, but written language is not. Children learn to speak easily, but writing is a skill that must be taught. Writing systems have been invented only a few times in history, and it's not natural for children to invent their own writing systems.

I've never started writing a book with more uncertainty. I'm not even sure what to call it. The story I'm telling is not about a dramatic event like a wedding or a death. Instead, it's about my memories of a man I met occasionally, and I don't know what happened to him in between our meetings. I could try to fill in the gaps with my imagination, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write what I know.
To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I've given the characters in this story fake names. I've also tried to make sure that no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and it's possible that he never will be. If that's the case, my book will only be interesting because of its own value. But maybe the way he lived his life and his special character will have a lasting impact on the people around him, and even after he's gone, people will realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I'm writing about, and those who want to learn more about his early life will find something useful in my book.
I don't pretend that the conversations I've recorded are exact quotes. I never took notes, but I have a good memory, and I've written down the conversations in my own words. They're as accurate as I can make them.
I've taken some liberties with the conversations to make them more believable and interesting. I've done this for the same reason that historians do it - to make the story more engaging. I want my book to be enjoyable to read, and I think I'm justified in doing what I can to make it that way. The reader can easily see when I've used this technique, and they can choose to ignore it if they want.
Another reason I'm anxious about writing this book is that the people I'm writing about come from a different culture. It's hard to really know people, and I don't think you can ever truly know someone who's from a different country. People are shaped by their upbringing, their environment, and their experiences. You can't learn about these things just by hearing about them - you have to live them. And because you can't really know someone from a different culture, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never written about people from other cultures before, and I'm not sure how well I'll do it."

'POETRY RECITALS At any time in history, people often find the literary scene confusing. It's only with hindsight that we can see the pattern of important writers and their work clearly. Today, there is a lot of confusion about different types of poetry, different ways of writing and presenting it, and different opinions about the role of poets in society. In general, the current debate in poetry is about the difference between writers who focus on publishing their work in books and those who prefer to perform their poetry in front of an audience. This division is not absolute, as there are many ways to promote poetry readings. Small groups in towns and cities organize events in community centers or private homes. Schools and universities invite poets to read and talk to students. Arts festivals often feature poetry readings by well-known authors. These events have many consequences, both positive and negative, for poets. For some poets, performing their work in public is essential. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand, and they can be enjoyed immediately. However, the same poems may not be as effective when read on the page. Poets who are dedicated to their craft may struggle to connect with an audience that is hearing their work for the first time. The danger is that they may compromise their artistic vision to appeal to a wider audience. Attending poetry readings can be enjoyable and educational, but it's important to remember that it's not a substitute for reading poetry on the page. It's best to either read the text while listening to the reading or have a prior knowledge of the poems. The main reason for popular poetry recitals is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to a wider audience, rather than just an elite group.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at the B2 level (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages):
**Oral History**
When historians ask people about the past, they must be careful. The person telling the story might not remember everything exactly as it happened. The historian also influences what the person says by choosing who to interview and what questions to ask. Even if the historian doesn't ask questions, just being present can change how the person remembers the past. The historian's own thoughts and ideas can also affect what the person says.
When the historian is not present, the person telling the story might remember things that they learned from others, or they might remember things that happened later. This can make it hard to know what really happened in the past.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: by looking at how their bodies work, or by studying their behavior in the wild. Some scientists focus on how animals' bodies work, while others study how animals behave in their natural habitats.
Some scientists study animals in labs, while others study animals in their natural habitats. Both approaches are important, but they look at different things. Even if we know how an animal's body works, we still need to study how it behaves.
**The Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you have to learn two things at the same time. You need to learn about the subject itself, and you need to learn how to study it. Social sciences are not just common sense; each discipline has its own way of studying and thinking about people and society.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses and buildings. It was an art that involved order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought about how to make buildings look good, not just how to make them functional.
The origins of classical architecture are complex, but it is based on simple ideas about how to build a house or a temple. Even though ancient buildings might look fancy, they are based on simple ideas about how to build a shelter.

Susan is leaving the family home now that her children are grown up. She notices that the removal company, 'Removers of Distinction', is taking everything out of the house. The removal men, led by Fred, are carefully packing up the belongings. The house is a lovely four-storeyed building overlooking a small harbour. Susan has many memories of her time there, watching her children grow up and leave. When they first bought the house, her son Robert was curious about how they would get it home. Now, Susan is worried about leaving the house, especially the piano. Her daughter Francesca is also helping with the move, making sure the piano is taken care of. Susan is surprised to hear that people often cry when they are moving, but she is trying to stay strong.
As Susan sits on the stairs, she remembers when they first moved into the house. The piano got stuck on the stairs, and it took a lot of effort to get it up to the top floor. She also remembers the time her husband, Peter, came home and helped resolve the issue. They eventually found a way to get the piano into the house, and it was a big relief. However, it took a while to get it professionally tuned.
Now, as Susan is leaving the house, she is worried about the stairs, which are not perfect anymore. She should have warned the removal men about the piano, but it's too late now. As she looks around, she feels overwhelmed and a bit panicked. Fred notices that she is upset and reassures her that they will finish the move soon. The piano is the last thing to go, and Susan is relieved when it's finally out of the house. She laughs with her children, Robert and Francesca, as they leave the house for the last time."

'Online Book Reviews: A New Way to Share Opinions
The idea of the internet was to make it easy for anyone to share their thoughts and opinions with others. At first, it was hard to publish things online, but then Amazon, a popular online bookstore, made it possible for anyone to write reviews of books. Anyone could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a great idea because it allowed readers to see what other people thought of a book, not just what the publisher or professional critics said.
Amazon was the biggest online bookstore, and it got a lot of reviews. But with so many reviews, it was hard to make sure they were all good. Amazon had a team that checked the reviews to make sure they followed the rules. They didn't allow reviews that were just one word, or that were mean to the author, or that had bad language.
Some people tried to cheat by writing fake reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, wrote bad reviews about his own book and then wrote good reviews to balance them out. But when he wrote about it in an article, Amazon took down the fake reviews.
Authors could also write comments on their own books. Most authors wrote nice messages, but some gave their email address so readers could contact them. However, anyone could write a comment, even if it wasn't really from the author.
Some people got upset when they saw bad reviews of a book. When a book called ""We've Got Spirit"" came out, people who were in the book wrote angry reviews, but they were taken down. Amazon liked that people were taking the time to read and write reviews because it helped them sell more books.
The most important thing about Amazon reviews is that they are honest. Most people wrote serious reviews, and they helped others decide whether to buy a book. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing books was hard because you had to pretend to like books you didn't really like. But with online reviews, people can be honest and share their real opinions.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B2 level reader:
Art has changed over the last 200 years. We used to think that every artist had to be different and innovative. We admire artists who were ahead of their time, but we're not always open to new art today. We expect art to be unique and shocking, but we're not sure what that means. We want artists to be special and talented, but we're not sure what that looks like.
Let me describe a situation, and then I'll ask a question about it. Imagine an artist who chooses a text from an art book that talks about different types of pictures. The text says there are many kinds of pictures, and the artist decides to make a canvas with this text. The artist asks someone to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: is this a painting?
In the art world, it's common for artists to stick to what they're good at. If an artist is successful with one type of art, they usually keep doing it. But some artists try new things, and that's not always accepted. Eric Rimmington is an artist who is trying something new. He's known for painting still lifes, but now he's painting scenes from the London Underground.
I've escaped to a remote island with some books. I'm not sure why I came here, but the villagers think it's because I'm sick. I'm not happy or unhappy; I'm just suspended in my memories. I used to talk about the uselessness of art, but I didn't mention its benefits. As an artist, I find comfort in my work because it allows me to reorder reality and find meaning in it. Through art, I can fulfill my destiny and find joy, rather than trying to escape it.

""My dad said, 'It's no good.' We were driving back to London after I finished school. My dad and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school, a fancy girls' school. My dad was not happy. He had just met with my headteacher and found out that I would get a scholarship to Oxford University. He was worried that I would give up on the family business.
'I'm not going to fool you,' my dad said. 'You'll do what you want now.' He was talking about how I would use my certificates to get a good job. 'You're going to be a lawyer, aren't you?' he asked. My dad knew a lot about law and lawyers.
'I just said that,' I replied. 'I didn't know what else to say.' My dad continued, 'And you have the right personality for it. You're good at finding the important parts of a problem, you're good at talking, and you enjoy performing.' I said I didn't know about that, but my dad went on, 'I think your heart won't be in the business anymore. You'll go to Oxford, and then I don't see you wanting to work with us.'
The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by the family expectations. I saw that there were many other jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore my options. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my dad. I wasn't as scared of him as my brother Maurice was, but I still found him intimidating.
'It's too soon to know,' I said weakly. 'You're not going to want me to join the business,' my dad said. 'It's a pity because you have the skills - brains, nerves, vision.' I mentioned my brother Maurice, who hated the business. My dad snorted.
We then talked about how I could help the family business in my free time, and my dad suggested I could be a consultant. I agreed, and that's what happened. I helped out during holidays and then left the business after I finished university.
Years later, my dad came to visit me and asked me to do one last job for him. It was a big deal for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my while. I was worried about my final exams, but my dad didn't understand. He thought I would be happy to help him, and he would be upset if I refused. I felt a bit overwhelmed by my dad's single-mindedness and energy. In the end, I agreed to do the job.""

Simon Costello knew that buying a house in Pembroke Square was a mistake soon after he and his wife Lois moved in. A possession that requires strict economy is not worth having. At the time, it seemed like a sensible and desirable move. Simon had a streak of successful cases and they were coming in regularly. Lois went back to her job at the advertising agency two months after the twins were born and got a promotion, increasing her salary to £35,000. Lois had argued more strongly for a move, and Simon didn't resist her arguments. They needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for their au pair. These things could have been achieved in a suburb or a less fashionable part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. She wanted a prestigious address, Mornington Mansions, which was not suitable for a young barrister and a successful businesswoman.
Lois decided that one of them should take public transport to work. Her office was on the other side of London, so Simon had to make the sacrifice. The crowded tube journey made him feel resentful and unhappy. He thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy, and how his grandmother would give him a warm welcome and make him feel relaxed. She was a 'lawyer's wife', always supporting good causes and attending lawyers' events.
Simon and Lois had discussed their careers before they got married, and they both knew how important they were to each other. Their lifestyle depended on their two salaries. But now, what they had achieved could be destroyed by Venetia, a woman who had come to their office and was furious. She had accused Simon of knowing that a client had bribed a jury four years ago and doing nothing about it. Simon denied the accusation, but it seemed unconvincing even to himself. He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering a similar situation from his past. Venetia's anger and disgust made him realize that his career could be ruined if this got out."

I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous here. I didn't want to be judged by my living conditions or my garden. But, as it turns out, people in the shops start to recognize me. My neighbour, Jaz, is a writer who often comes to my flat to ask for my opinion on her work. One day, I was clearing my garden and Jaz appeared at my window. She asked me to come up and have a drink with her. I didn't want her to see my garden, so I told her I was busy. She came down anyway and we sat in my garden. She was talking about her latest book and how she's struggling to make a living as a writer. I tried to give her some advice, but she didn't take it well. She said I should focus on writing about nice people and not just myself. I told her I keep a journal to record the good things that happen each day. She laughed and said I should get a life.

**Heritage and the Past**
Heritage is important because it helps us feel connected to our past. We learn about our family history and the stories of our ancestors. This connection to the past is important for understanding our own identity and our future. Heritage is a way to understand who we are and where we come from.
We can learn about our heritage through stories, legends, and cultural traditions. In the past, people passed down stories and legends from generation to generation. However, with the growth of cities and changes in society, many of these stories have been lost. Today, we can learn about our heritage through museums, historical sites, and cultural events.
**The Fens**
The Fens is a region in England that is known for its unique landscape and culture. It is a place where the past and present come together. The author of a novel about the Fens, Graham Swift, chose to write about this region because of its unique character. The Fens are a place where nature and human activity coexist, and where the past and present are intertwined.
**Museums**
Museums are important places where we can learn about our heritage. They should make their collections accessible to everyone, not just experts. Museums should use displays and interactive exhibits to make history come alive. They should also provide resources for teachers and communities to learn about our heritage.
**Preserving the Past**
Preserving the past is important for our identity and our future. Change is a natural part of life, but we need to learn how to handle it. Preserving our heritage helps us understand who we are and where we come from. It is important for planners and decision-makers to consider the need for preservation and to find ways to balance change with the need to preserve our heritage.

'Einstein is a famous scientist. Many people know his face, but not much about what he did. He developed some important ideas about the universe, called ""relativity"". These ideas are hard to understand and seem strange. Einstein's work was a big step forward in science. He looked at the basics of the universe, like time, space, matter, and energy. Before Einstein, scientists thought about the universe in a different way. They believed that time and space were absolute. Einstein said that time and space are not absolute, but relative.
In our childhood, my sister and I didn't like prize-winning books because we thought they were boring. Our father would give us money to read them, but we would rather read other books. He would also give us books that he thought were important, marked with a note saying ""This is not literature"". We didn't like most of these books, but they introduced us to some good stories and poetry.
The origin of language is a mystery. People have made many strange claims about it. Some think that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" to express fear. These sounds have been passed down in languages, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" or ""mors"" meaning ""death"". Many people avoid talking about the origin of language because they think it's a topic for weirdos. However, recently, scientists have been studying it a lot. They think that language developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. At first, language was used for friendly conversations and power struggles. It was not just for sharing information, as some philosophers have said.'

""Writing Reviews: A Practitioner's Perspective
Many reviews are written quickly and have a short lifespan. They are often limited in length and are only published for a short time, usually a day, a week, or a month. The temporary nature of reviews is often seen as a reflection of their importance. It's commonly believed that people only write reviews because they don't have time to focus on more important work. However, writing reviews is a challenging and multi-faceted job. It requires not only the ability to summarize a book or article quickly, but also the skill to control one's arguments and write clearly.
The length of a review is just one consideration. The reviewer must also think about their audience. They need to write in a way that is engaging for both casual readers and those who are already familiar with the subject. Additionally, reviewers need to have a broad range of knowledge and be able to write in a way that is easy to understand.
It's no surprise that many writers who review books also write other things. The American novelist John Updike, for example, enjoys writing reviews between his novels. Some people may feel that reviews are not worth keeping, but many writers believe that their best work is often buried in reviews. I, too, feel this way about my own writing.
In the English-speaking world, it's common for academics to write reviews in addition to their main work. This is because there is no clear distinction between reviewing and literary study. As a result, many academics write reviews as part of their job. While some people may still criticize academics for writing reviews, I believe that it's beneficial for both readers and academics. Reviews can help academics communicate their ideas to a wider audience and remind them of their responsibility to make their work accessible to non-experts.""

Ralph walked into his flat, feeling a familiar sense of ownership. It was a feeling he still got, even after three years, when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first moved in, he used to rush home early, eager to see what had happened while he was away. He thought the flat was a place where he could relax and be himself.
Over time, Ralph started to see his flat as an extension of himself. He would leave it tidy or messy, and it would always be waiting for him, unchanged. The only signs of life were the occasional letters by the door and the blinking answering machine. Ralph was grateful that his flat was still intact, but he wondered what it would be like if he didn't come back.
Ralph often looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the office. He would sit alone, surrounded by his belongings, and feel a sense of relief. But this feeling would soon give way to emptiness and a sense of disconnection from himself. He would try to distract himself by reading or listening to music, but he would often find himself wondering why he was doing these things.
Ralph used to have a sense of direction, but it had changed over time. He had followed a path that seemed easy, without really thinking about what he wanted. He had applied for jobs without much enthusiasm, and ended up in a role that didn't make him happy. He had taken the job without questioning it, and now he was stuck in a routine that was draining him.
Ralph's thoughts often turned to his past, when he was more confident and had a sense of purpose. He wondered what had happened to that person, and why he had lost his way. He had taken a job without thinking it through, and now he was struggling to find his place in the world.

As a managing director, I am often required to give presentations to my colleagues and external stakeholders. I'm not naturally good at it, but I need to improve. How can I do this? Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many executives are expected to be good at it. To be convincing, you need to be convinced yourself. Show your passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. This means doing your homework and preparing well in advance. Ask colleagues to help you anticipate the questions your audience might ask. Start your presentation by finding something your audience can relate to and build towards your conclusion.

""Some things cannot be rushed. For example, if you're making mayonnaise, you need to add the oil slowly or it will curdle. Similarly, if you're fishing and your line gets tangled, pulling on it will only make it worse. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can speed up some processes, like solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But others cannot be rushed and will break down if we try to hurry them. 
Our minds have different ways of thinking and learning. Some things require quick, automatic reactions, like when you need to react to a sudden situation. Other things need more time and thought, like solving a problem or making a decision. 
There are three main ways our minds work: fast physical intelligence, thinking, and slow, contemplative thinking. Fast physical intelligence is like a reflex, and it helps us react quickly in certain situations. Thinking is the ability to reason and solve problems. Slow, contemplative thinking is more relaxed and allows us to reflect and ponder. 
All three types of thinking are important and necessary. We need to be able to react quickly in some situations, think carefully in others, and reflect slowly in still others. In fact, recent research has shown that slow, contemplative thinking is particularly useful when dealing with complex or unclear situations. It's like having a 'tortoise mind' that can help us make sense of things that are difficult to understand. 
Poets and philosophers have long known the importance of slow, contemplative thinking, and scientists are now starting to study it more closely. They're discovering that our unconscious mind can do many things more efficiently than our conscious mind, like learning patterns and solving complex problems. So, we need to give our minds time to think and reflect, and not rush through life."""

Many people are surprised that she takes on this extra work, but Joanna believes that teaching children is very important. She has written three books to help children learn the piano in a fun and easy way.
Joanna used to teach piano lessons to children when she was younger. She saw how some children were very talented and could learn quickly, but others struggled and gave up. She thinks that music should be available to everyone, not just those who are very good at it. She wants to make learning the piano enjoyable for all children, not just the ones who are naturally talented.
Joanna's new book, ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"", is designed to make learning the piano fun and easy. It includes stories and games to help children learn, and the accompanying CDs have music in different styles to keep children interested. Joanna believes that children should be allowed to improvise and experiment with music, and that they should be encouraged to play with both hands and use the pedals.
Joanna also thinks that practice is very important. She used to find it hard to practice when she was younger, but now she loves it. She suggests that children should set goals for themselves and work towards them, and that they should take breaks and reward themselves for their progress.

In medieval times, there are only a few mentions of people eating in the morning, usually before a long journey or when they were ill. Most people didn't eat breakfast unless they were rich or royal. But in the 16th century, breakfast became more popular. Some people think this was because there was more food available.

Birds have always fascinated humans. We love them, fear them, and sometimes even worship them. But what does this say about us? A wren is bouncing against the glass of a greenhouse. Is it trying to tell us something, or is it just stuck? Wrens have been a part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the direction in which a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are often depicted in art and ceramics in British homes. The wren still has a special place in our hearts and minds.
Our relationship with birds goes back to a time when people relied on nature for survival. As a result, we developed a way of communicating about the importance of other creatures. This connection is not just cultural, but also ecological. It's a way of understanding the world around us.
The relationship between humans and birds has changed over time. For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed it bread. But it became seen as a pest and was eventually wiped out. Now, it's a symbol of conservation efforts.
Birds are important to us because they remind us of our own identity. We're fascinated by their ability to fly, sing, and be free. This fascination is a measure of our own sense of identity and our connection to nature.
In recent years, birds have become a way to measure the health of the environment. The loss of 30 bird species in Britain is not just a loss of natural beauty, but also a cultural loss.
Birds carry a lot of cultural significance. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are symbols of love, romance, and magic. The loss of these birds is a loss of cultural heritage.
Folklore is important because it helps us connect with the natural world in a way that's deeper than just scientific facts. The stories and legends we tell about birds are a way of interpreting what they mean to us. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our own backyards, we can't fully understand their significance without these stories.
The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past, and the mystery of the natural world."

Here is a rewritten version of the text, simplified for a learner of English at the B2 level:
Maps are used to show the relationships between different places and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, such as 'a day's journey' or 'an hour's walk'. However, this method did not provide accurate information about actual distance. Direction was also important, but for travelers, knowing where to go and how far it was did not require precise direction. For a long time, written itineraries were as useful as maps.
Today, some maps, like those showing railway systems, may not show accurate directions. Landmarks along a route were initially indicated by signs, which varied in size to show their importance. The conventions used on maps varied depending on their purpose and location, so it's essential to understand the specific convention used when studying early maps.
The history of cartography is largely about improving the accuracy of distance and direction measurements and the completeness of maps. Cartographers have borrowed from other sciences, such as astronomy and geology, to achieve this. For example, the use of magnetic compasses and instruments to calculate horizontal angles has increased the accuracy of maps. The discovery that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but is slightly flattened at the poles, has also led to improvements in mapping.
The demands on mapmakers have changed over time. Travelers, merchants, and soldiers have all had different needs. The development of artillery and the need for accurate representations of terrain features have led to the invention of contour lines. Today, cartographers must create maps for various users, including archaeologists, historians, and geographers, each with their own specific requirements.
The widespread recognition of the value of maps in many sciences has led to a modern renaissance in cartography. However, there have been periods of stagnation and progress, and cartographers have often had to wait for technical improvements before they could apply new ideas. Maps should not be accepted as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique without critical evaluation.
The many thousands of maps that have been preserved provide a valuable record of human thought and work, making the study of historical cartography fascinating and instructive.

I visited Andrew Lloyd Webber's home, a cozy room filled with records, a record player, and some expensive-looking furniture. He was a talented teenager who had won a scholarship to study history at Oxford University. I had my own dreams, too - I wanted to be a pop star. Andrew and I became friends and started talking about music. He asked me to help him write a musical, and I agreed. I had never written lyrics before, but Andrew was a great composer, and I was excited to work with him.
We decided to write a musical about a famous philanthropist named Dr. Thomas Barnardo. Andrew had been working on the idea for a year, and I thought it was a good story. We wrote many songs, and I had a lot of fun doing it. Andrew was very enthusiastic about his music, and I was impressed by his talent. I even skipped a day of work to write more lyrics.
Looking back, I realize that I had changed my career path. I had started out as a law student, but now I was a lyricist. I was excited to see where this new path would take me.

""Language is a remarkable ability that allows us to shape each other's thoughts with precision. It is so deeply connected to human experience that it's hard to imagine life without it. People often talk to each other, even to animals or plants, when there is no one else around. I like to think of language as an instinct, like how spiders spin webs. They don't need to learn how to do it, it just comes naturally.
Climate and weather have a big impact on the lives of animals and plants. The type of climate can shape the landscape and affect the types of living things that can survive there. For example, warm and wet weather allows for the growth of tropical jungles, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas can only support a limited number of living things.
The daily weather patterns that make up the climate are caused by big movements of air in the atmosphere. The sun also plays a role in these movements.

Television and Art
Television often fails to create good programs about art. This is surprising, as TV can show a whole piece of art and then zoom in on the details. However, few TV shows have successfully captured the joy and complexity of looking at art. A recent example of what goes wrong is a series about American art by Robert Hughes. Hughes is a well-known art critic with a strong personality. He had eight hours to introduce British audiences to a type of American art that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks. Instead, it showed how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
Metals
I used to work in the metals trade for 20 years. I was a successful speculator and made a lot of money. The metals market is not regulated like other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it's possible to make a lot of money. However, the prices of metals have decreased significantly over the past 20 years due to increased production and lower costs. I was asked to investigate allegations against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
Abaco and its Cays
Abaco and its surrounding islands are part of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own unique character and attractions. The best way to get around is by boat.

Sailing is the most popular way to get around, as Abaco is known as the ""Sailing Capital of the World"". The calm waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The beaches stretch for 200 miles, making it a paradise for beachgoers. At night, the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle like diamonds.

**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike**
In Hackney Wick, London, there's a special workshop where you can build your own bamboo bike. James Marr and Ian McMillan, two engineers, run the Bamboo Bike Club. They offer a course where you can design and build your own custom bike frame over a weekend.
Bamboo is a popular material for bike frames because it's sustainable and unique. However, most bamboo bikes are expensive, costing around £1,800. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable, so they developed a system to design and build frames that are both strong and affordable.
The course is fun and hands-on. On the first day, you'll learn how to select the right bamboo and join it together. You'll also use special tools and design blueprints to create your frame. James and Ian will guide you through the process, making sure everything is done correctly.
On the second day, you'll focus on building the lugs, which are the parts that hold the frame together. You'll use hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create a strong bond. Finally, you'll add the finishing touches, such as wheels, brakes, and a saddle.
The result is a unique and sustainable bike that's as strong as a metal bike. James and Ian have tested their bikes and claim they're perfect for long commutes or casual rides. And the best part? The price is under £500!

Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought it would be a bestseller and it was. Dr. Gray's book is about how to understand each other better, especially between men and women. It's very popular and makes a lot of money. This kind of book is called self-help and it's very popular in the United States.
Self-help books are often criticized for being too easy or too complicated. But there are many good ones that help people improve themselves. Editors look for books that are easy to understand and have a good message. A good title can make a big difference. Some people write autobiographies, which are books about their own lives. But sometimes these books are not entirely true. The writer might leave out important details or make things up to make the story more interesting.
Detective stories are very popular and have been around for a long time. They often represent the struggles of society. The detective is like a symbol of good and the criminal is like a symbol of evil. The detective tries to catch the criminal and bring them to justice. The writer of detective stories, Dashiell Hammett, wrote about the corrupt society of his time.
There are many great science writers, but one of the best is Stephen Jay Gould. He believes that to write about science, you need to understand the culture of science. You need to be part of the scientific community and know its rules. Gould also thinks that you should never write down to your readers. You should use simple language, but not simplify the argument. If you patronize your readers, they will not like your writing.

Air-Conditioning at the Gym
Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, has turned up the air-conditioning to combat the hot summer temperatures. It's so cold that it feels like being in the Arctic! This is just one example of how air-conditioning is used excessively in modern life. Many buildings could use alternative methods to stay cool, such as using natural light and ventilation. These methods might seem obvious, but they can be effective and reduce the need for air-conditioning.
Sundials
It's interesting to see that sundials are becoming popular again. These ancient instruments measure time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping accurate time. As clocks and watches became more reliable, sundials were relegated to being decorative garden ornaments. Now, they're being taken seriously again. Sundial maker David Harber believes their appeal lies in their connection to the planets. He says there's a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They're still, calm, and romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Title:** American Managers Look to Ernest Shackleton for Inspiration
**Text:**
Many American business leaders are looking to Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer, for advice on how to manage a company. Shackleton led a team of explorers to the Antarctic in the early 20th century. He is now being studied by American executives because of his leadership skills and ability to make difficult decisions.
Shackleton's story is inspiring to many because he was a natural leader. He was able to keep his team motivated and safe even in the most challenging situations. He believed in being honest and open with his team, and he always put their needs first.
American managers are learning from Shackleton's approach to leadership. They are studying how he handled difficult situations, such as when his ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice. Shackleton made the tough decision to turn back and save his team's lives. He believed that the lives of his team members were more important than reaching their destination.
Shackleton's leadership skills are being applied to modern business challenges. For example, when a company is facing a crisis, leaders need to be able to make difficult decisions quickly. Shackleton's ability to stay calm and think clearly in emergency situations is an inspiration to many business leaders.
Shackleton's story is also a reminder of the importance of teamwork and communication. He believed that everyone on his team had a role to play, and he encouraged them to share their ideas and opinions. This approach has been adopted by many American companies, which are looking for ways to improve their communication and teamwork.
Overall, Shackleton's leadership skills and values are an inspiration to many American business leaders. His story is a reminder of the importance of honesty, integrity, and teamwork in business and in life.

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special kind of primate called the aye-aye. It has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker. Both woodpeckers and aye-ayes search for insect larvae by drilling into wood. Woodpeckers use their beaks and long tongues, while aye-ayes use their front teeth and a long, thin finger.
Scientists have been studying the aye-aye's hunting skills. They wanted to know how it finds insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson, a scientist, tested two male aye-ayes, two females, and an infant. He presented them with logs with holes drilled into them. Some holes had mealworms inside, while others were empty. The aye-ayes easily found the mealworms, even without seeing or smelling them. They didn't use their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects.
Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes use a special way to find the insects. They tap the wood with their middle finger and bring their large ears forward, focusing them on the spot in front of their nose. This helps them detect the hollow space below. They can also hear the insects moving when disturbed by the tapping. The aye-aye's way of finding food is similar to that of woodpeckers and bats, which also use sound to locate their prey.
The aye-aye's unique features also make it similar to squirrels. Its front teeth grow continuously, like a squirrel's, and it has been observed gnawing through nut shells and extracting the nut meat with its long finger.

Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but few of us know much about their lives when they were young. We often want to write down our memories, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a way to tell the stories of ordinary people's lives. She writes their autobiographies, which are at least 20,000 words long and include pictures if needed. She started doing this because she realized that many people's pasts were disappearing. 
She talks to people and writes down their stories. They tell her things they might not have shared with others, because she promises to keep their stories confidential. One man she interviewed said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were things that hurt, like my divorce, and the pain was still there."" He did it for his family, but hasn't shown it to his children yet. 
Hannah has found that many people's lives are shaped by what happened to them when they were young. They might make the same mistakes over and over again. She also finds that people often regret or resent things that happened with their parents, even after 60 years. 
Hannah is careful to keep her distance and not pry into people's private lives. She writes the stories in a way that is honest but respectful. Each book takes up to 30 hours of interviews, which she uses to write the story. She can even choose the color of the book cover and the title. The books are expensive, but people are willing to pay for them because they want to keep their family's stories alive.

Journalist Tom Mumford joined 13 students from Europe and America on a special flight to test their scientific theories. The aircraft, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, looked like a normal plane from the outside. But inside, it was a unique environment. The seats were removed, and the students had to wear special harnesses to keep them safe. The flight was a rollercoaster ride, with the plane climbing up and then falling down. This created a weightless environment for the students to conduct their experiments.
The students had competed to get on this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative ideas for experiments to do in space. The best ideas won a place on the flight. The students were excited to be on this adventure.
During the flight, the students did experiments to study how objects move in space. One group looked at how cats land on their feet, while another group examined how metal joins are affected by gravity. Another team even tried to make solar sails using thin liquid films.

I had a unique experience in New Zealand. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually their winter. My parents bought a small piece of land, and I, my brother, and sister could take care of it. We had to plant trees on the land. If we did, we could keep the land. My father was born in New Zealand, so it was a special connection. The land was not very good for farming, but it was perfect for planting trees. I had worked on sheep farms in Australia before, so I was excited to plant trees.
I started planting in 1968 and finished in 1972. It was a very wet winter, but it was a happy time. We would get up every morning, ready to plant more trees. It was hard work, but I enjoyed it. I had a friend who was experienced in planting trees, which helped me a lot. We would fill bags with trees and then plant them. The hardest part was making sure the trees were planted in straight lines.
After a while, planting trees became automatic. I would get into a rhythm and plant the trees quickly. It was also mentally stimulating. I would think about the natural world and our place in it. This experience had a big impact on my life.
I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and seen the trees grow. It's been satisfying to see them thrive. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but it's been good for the trees so far. I even wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green"", while I was back there in 1984. I stayed for three months and wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. The connection I feel to that place is still strong. It's a special bond between people and the earth.

We turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago. Since then, we've become known for taking care of orphaned animals. Recently, we received a cardboard box containing three small grey badger cubs. They were about eight inches long and had milky-coloured eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. The mother badger had been killed, and the cubs were cold and whimpering. We took them in and kept them warm by the stove. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.
We fed them with a syringe at first, but then they started drinking from a bottle. We had to wipe their faces with a warm cloth to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, we fed them every four hours. After a week, they were eating and moving around more easily.
However, Willow seemed lethargic one day, and unfortunately, he died from a lung infection. This was because we let him drink too fast from the bottle, which can cause problems in small animals. We continued to care for the other two, but six days later, a local farmer brought us another male badger cub, Willow II.
Willow II was a bit more difficult to feed because he was younger and had not learned to eat properly. It took him a while to get used to eating solid food. The other two, Primrose and Bluebell, were eating well and even started to play with each other. As they grew, they became more independent and started to explore their surroundings.
As the summer was very hot, it was hard for them to find food. We had to help them by giving them a special diet. By August, they were eating a variety of foods, including cereals, meat, and fruit. They even started to go for walks at night, chasing each other and playing in the long grass.
We also noticed that other badgers were visiting our field, probably because they were struggling to find food. We were warned that they might attack our cubs, so we took precautions to protect them. The local press wrote about our story, and people were so interested that we started a campaign to build a special home for the badgers. With the help of local businesses and a bus company, we built a sett with tunnels and a badger gate. The cubs loved their new home and would explore it before going on their nightly walks.
Eventually, they moved into their new sett, and we would often see them playing and exploring their territory. Although we don't see them as often now, they still come to say hello before going off into the night."

Sir Edmund Halley is best known for the comet that bears his name, but his work on charting the compass variations was just as important. Without this knowledge, sailors couldn't correct their compasses, making it difficult to navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley's journey was not easy. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Rio de Janeiro, but his first trip was cut short due to crew problems. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans.
Dr Clark is planning to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing his route. He will use more advanced instruments to make precise measurements of the magnetic field, which is constantly changing. This data will help scientists refine their understanding of the Earth's magnetic field.
Dr Clark became interested in Halley's work during a two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica. He believes that Halley's life was remarkable, not just because of his scientific achievements, but also because of his adventurous spirit.
Recreating Halley's journey will not only pay tribute to his legacy but also provide valuable scientific data. Dr Clark hopes to complete the expedition in four stages, with different crews for each stage. He is prepared to spend eight months at sea to achieve his goal.'

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How do these birds get away with having such a useless feature? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are trying to find the answer.
Charles Darwin believed that living creatures evolved over time through a process called natural selection. This means that the individuals best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and have babies. However, the peacocks' tails don't seem to fit this idea. They are a waste of space and can even be a disadvantage. Darwin thought that there must be another reason why peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails.
Alfred Russel Wallace, a friend of Darwin's, had a different idea. He thought that peahens must be choosing peacocks with beautiful tails because they have some other quality that is not obvious to humans. Wallace believed that the peacocks' tails are like an advertisement, showing off their good health or other qualities that are important for survival.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to figure out why peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails. Marion Petrie and her team have been studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to see if the peahens really do choose the males with the most impressive tails. They have found that the peahens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which is related to the length of the tail. However, they are still not sure if the males with the most impressive tails are also healthier or more successful in other ways.
One scientist, William Hamilton, has suggested that showy birds are often healthier and more disease-free. This could be why peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails. But the scientists at Whipsnade haven't been able to test this idea yet.
The team is also studying the offspring of peacocks that have been chosen by hens. They want to see if the children of these peacocks grow faster or are healthier than the children of peacocks that hens don't find attractive. If they are, then it would support Wallace's idea that peahens choose peacocks with beautiful tails because they have some other quality that is important for survival.
Finally, a mathematician named R A Fisher proposed an idea called ""Fisher's Runaway"". He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the others, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail and the daughters will inherit their mother's preference for long tails. This could start a process where the males with the longest tails get more mates and leave more offspring, and the females' preference for long tails increases over time. This could explain why peacocks have such long tails. Interestingly, this would also support Darwin's idea that females choose ""beauty for beauty's sake"" once the process gets going.

**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe, a boat designer, believes that the best boat combines old and new ideas. He built his own boat, ""The Westerman"", which looks like it's 100 years old, but has all the modern technology. This is unusual because most modern boats are designed with new technology and look very different.
I have my own boat, which is not as flashy as the ones at the boat show in London. It's designed for sailing, not for luxury. I like it because it's simple and easy to use. Some people might think I'm a romantic, but I just like the feeling of being at sea.
Some modern boats have too many gadgets and technology, which can make sailing less enjoyable. Sailing is about being close to nature and facing challenges. I think it's important to have a boat that's simple and practical.
I used to have an old boat called Hirta, which I sailed around Britain for a TV show. It was simple, but it was a great boat. I had to learn how to take care of it, but it was worth it. Eventually, I had to sell it because I got hurt and couldn't sail it anymore.
I built my new boat, The Westerman, from scratch. The designer, Nigel Irens, used a combination of traditional and modern methods to create the design. The boat is made of wood, which is strong and durable. It's not flashy, but it's a great sailing boat.
The Westerman has sailed across the Atlantic and has won several racing competitions. It's a timeless boat that doesn't follow current trends. I think it's a great example of how to design a boat that's both functional and beautiful.

**Health Farms and Country House Hotels: A Perfect Break**
I recently visited five health farms and country house hotels to see what they have to offer. I was looking for a relaxing break and a chance to recharge. Here's what I found:
**Henlow Grange**
I stayed at Henlow Grange for six days. The room was comfortable and cozy. I spent my days doing body conditioning exercises and taking classes like yoga and stretching. The instructors were very good and helped me feel more flexible. The hotel has many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and massages. The staff were friendly and professional. I left feeling relaxed and energized.
**Shrubland Hall**
Shrubland Hall is a beautiful stately home with a calm atmosphere. I had a medical check-up when I arrived, which included a weight and blood pressure check. The fitness instructor helped me with a shoulder problem I had. I followed a special diet and lost weight. The hotel has a gym, pool, and spa facilities. I enjoyed my stay and felt refreshed.
**Careys Manor**
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but a lovely old manor house. The food is delicious, but if you're counting calories, you might want to choose a lighter option. The hotel has a gym, pool, and spa facilities. I had a treatment for my shoulder injury and felt much better. The hotel is comfortable and relaxing.
**Cliveden**
Cliveden is a luxurious country home with a five-star hotel. It offers many health and beauty treatments, a gym, pool, and other activities like horse riding and tennis. The food is excellent, and the surroundings are beautiful. I enjoyed my stay and felt pampered.
**Springs Hydro**
Springs Hydro is a modern hotel with a focus on relaxation. The aromatherapy massage was amazing, and the carrot cake was delicious (but be careful not to overindulge!). The hotel has many therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments. I would love to go back.
These health farms and country house hotels offer a great way to relax, recharge, and take care of your health."

**Natural Talents**
In just 7 million years, humans have not developed any significant genetic differences from chimpanzees. We are still very similar to them, with over 98% of our genes identical. This means that the things that make us human must have developed very recently. Our physical ability to create art, for example, must have come from a small number of genes.
Studies of animal behavior have shown that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to crack open shells. Monkeys even have their own language, with different sounds for warning calls.
If human art came from a unique genetic ability, it's strange that our ancestors didn't develop it until recently. The earliest evidence of human art is from around 35,000 years ago, in the form of cave paintings, statues, and musical instruments.
There are three main differences between human art and animal activities. Firstly, human art is not functional, it's not used for survival or to pass on genes. Secondly, human art is made for aesthetic pleasure, not just for communication. Thirdly, human art is learned, not instinctive.
However, these distinctions are not as clear-cut as they seem. Some animal behaviors, like bird song, may be motivated by aesthetic pleasure. And while humans learn art, some animals also learn their behaviors.
In fact, a study showed that chimpanzees can create art for their own satisfaction, just like humans. The paintings were not functional, and the chimpanzees did not intend to communicate with others. This challenges our idea of what makes human art unique.

'The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It's also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. These days, you don't find many big adventures or heroes. Charles Blackmore's great adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The name means 'once entered you never come out', but locals call it the Desert of Death. He told me about his amazing journey in his calm home.
The team he led consisted of four British people, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. Unfortunately, the handlers had never worked with camels before - they were long-distance truck drivers. This could have been a disaster! They set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's most inhospitable desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating book about their journey.
At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something. 'I had always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who I really was, outside of the Army. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back, as no one had ever done that route before. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was kind to us.
The team faced many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and dehydration. They lost part of their precious water supply. But they also found some water when they needed it most. They didn't experience the desert's famous sandstorms or extreme cold. Charles Blackmore says, 'What drove me on was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. We were completely on our own once we got into the sandhills.'
Charles Blackmore was scared at the beginning, but he was determined to finish the journey. He says, 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've been through so much; you've got so much behind you.' By the end, they were very thin but strong and muscular. Charles Blackmore felt proud of what they achieved, but he also knows that his family is his greatest achievement.
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? He still yearns for the challenge and the sense of purpose it gave him. He finds it hard to fit into modern life now.'

I recently decided to get rid of my gadgets and go back to doing things by hand. Everyone loves technology, and it makes our lives easier. However, I had a bad experience with my word processor, which made me realize that gadgets are not always worth the trouble. I started to get rid of some of my household gadgets, and it made me wonder what technology really gives us. Does it give us more time to do other things, or do we just buy more gadgets to fill that time? 
I was always a bit uneasy about those electric sewing machines that move quickly across the fabric. Now, I can sew by hand and take my time. I can even listen to the radio or talk to my family while I sew. It's a very relaxing activity. I used to think that sewing by hand was boring and tiring, but it's actually quite enjoyable. I can see the progress I make and feel a sense of satisfaction. 
I've also started doing things like washing up by hand, which I find quite pleasant. I'm now thinking about getting rid of some other gadgets, like the freezer and the microwave oven. We might even be able to save some money by not using electric lights.

'Sleeping is an essential part of our daily routine. We spend about one-third of our lives asleep. Scientists are still trying to figure out why we need so much sleep. There are three main theories about the purpose of sleep. One theory says that sleep helps keep our bodies healthy. It's like a repair shop where our bodies fix any damage from the day and get ready for the next day. Another theory suggests that sleep helps us learn and remember things we did during the day. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to learn and remember new things. The third theory is about energy. It says that sleep gives us a chance to rest and recharge, so we have enough energy for the next day.'

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at the B2 level (CEFR):
'Eccentrics are people who behave in a way that is not normal or usual. But what is normal? We all have our own quirks and unusual habits. Some people love entering competitions, collecting strange items, or writing letters to the newspapers. Being eccentric means being true to ourselves.
 Inside us, there is a constant battle between being an individual and conforming to what others think is right. Most of the time, we choose to fit in with the crowd rather than stand out. People who have unusual hobbies or opinions often join groups to share their interests with others. They find comfort in being with others who understand them.
We all have a mix of individuality and conformity within us. We may feel the need to be different, but we also want to be accepted by others. This tension between being ourselves and fitting in is natural.
Some people have made a success of their lives by being true to themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous singer, is an example. He has said that when you do what you truly believe in, you will often surprise others.
However, being eccentric is not just about doing something unusual. It's about being natural and genuine. Eccentrics are not trying to be odd; they just are. They don't worry about what others think of them. They do what they do because it's who they are.
This is different from people who try to get attention or make a statement. Eccentrics are not trying to impress or escape from society. They just live their lives as they want to, without thinking about what others might think.'

Here is the simplified text, suitable for learners at the B2 level:
We asked four well-known naturalists to tell us about the wildlife book that has had the biggest impact on them. One of them, Geoffrey Lean, chose a book by Barbara Ward. She was a famous environmentalist who wrote about the importance of taking care of the planet. Her book, ""The Home of Man"", talks about how cities are growing and how we need to live in a way that is good for the Earth.
Another naturalist, Linda Bennett, chose a book about animal communication. The book, ""Signals for Survival"", was written by Niko Tinbergen, a scientist who studied animal behavior. The book is full of interesting stories and pictures that help readers understand how animals communicate with each other.
Lee Durrell chose a book that is very special to him. It's called ""My Family and Other Animals"" and it's about his childhood growing up in a family that loved animals. The book made him realize how important it is to care for the natural world.
Bruce Pearson chose a book called ""The Shell Bird Book"". It's a book about birds, and it has beautiful pictures of different species. The book helped him understand that there's more to birds than just identifying them. He learned that birds are also connected to music, literature, and art.
Finally, James Fisher wrote a book called ""The Shell Bird Book"" that was published in 1966. The book has beautiful pictures of birds by Eric Ennion, and it talks about different aspects of birds, such as migration and the history of birds in Britain. The book made the author realize that his emotional and creative response to nature was just as important as a scientific one.

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the impact of book reviews on a book's success. Here's what they said.
Publisher A Reviews are very important for us. A study found that many people buy a book because of a good review. Authors are happy with reviews, but publishers are more concerned about the number of words used to describe the book. A mix of positive and negative reviews can actually help sales.
Publisher B Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to get their books reviewed, preferably with a good review. Book reviewing is better now than it was 40 years ago, but there is still a problem with reviewing paperbacks.
Publisher C Reviews are essential for our business. Without them, we wouldn't be able to reach readers. When reviews are good, they can help sell books more than any advertisement. Readers trust a review from a respected reviewer.
Publisher D The relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK is complicated. In the US, a single review in The New York Times can make or break a book. In the UK, bookshop staff often don't pay attention to reviews, but some books that get consistently good reviews can eventually become popular.
Publisher E Of course, everyone wants long, positive reviews. But do they actually sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but the book didn't sell well. People thought they didn't need to buy the book because they had already read the reviews. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, people took note of reviews from certain authors, but now it's more about the style and quality of the review.

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, had a huge success with his first novel, The Horse Whisperer. Even before it was published, the book was a hot topic. Evans talks about his inspiration and his success.
At the beginning of the year, things didn't go well for Evans. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about his financial situation. He had no income for two years, and the bank was getting impatient. Instead of getting a job, Evans made a surprising decision. He bought a ticket to the US and spent three months researching his novel.
The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive and how a gypsy was able to calm it down by talking to it. Evans was fascinated by this and decided to write a screenplay. However, after the film project fell through, he decided to write the story as a book instead.
Evans spent the spring traveling across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt lonely and uncertain about his future, but he was determined to write his book.
When he returned home, he wrote the first half of the book. He was worried about his financial situation and needed to know if his book was worth continuing. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent, and he thought it was good enough to get an advance of $30,000. However, Evans needed more than that to pay off his debts and support his family.
In October, Evans sent his manuscript to seven UK publishers, and within a week, he received an offer of $75,000. The book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $53.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel.
Evans was amazed and grateful for his success. He decided not to write the screenplay for The Horse Whisperer and instead focused on writing another novel. He was proud of his independence and didn't want to become an employee of the film industry."

Volunteer tourism Four experts discuss the topic of international volunteering.
A. Some people argue that volunteering abroad doesn't really make a big difference. This is because many volunteers pay a fee to participate, which could be used to hire more local workers. For example, during gap years, the skills and experience required are often very basic. This raises questions about whether people are really motivated to help others or if they are just looking for personal benefits.
B. Volunteering can lead to better understanding between countries, improved conflict resolution, and more global participation in social issues. It can also create a network of international connections among ordinary people. The benefits of volunteering can be shared by both the volunteers and the host communities, and can contribute to the greater good.
C. Unfortunately, international volunteering can sometimes be a way for wealthy people from developed countries to feel good about themselves while not really making a difference. It can also be a way for individuals to gain career and personal benefits. On the other hand, volunteering can be a genuine way to provide technical assistance and make a positive impact. It can also help raise awareness about the causes of poverty and inequality.
D. Volunteer tourism can fit with people's desire to help others. It seems like a positive and attractive way to make a difference, especially in a time when people are skeptical of big government and big business. However, it can also avoid addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality. Some people might view volunteer tourism as a way to work around these issues rather than tackling them head-on.
I minimized changes to the factual content to maintain the answerability of the questions associated with the text. I used simpler vocabulary and sentence structures while preserving the main ideas and arguments presented by the original authors."

""Choosing a Good Clock Radio
Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios. We found that some had useful features, but others were not so good.
One clock radio had a ""dual alarm function"" that allowed you to set two different wake-up times. However, the instruction booklet advised using this feature to set different times for weekdays and weekends, which seemed unnecessary. This model was also quite expensive, but it did have a built-in cassette player, which was a nice feature.
We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but the clock was quite big. Paul Bridges said that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, and phone.
We tested five clock radios and chose the best one. It had a digital display with a nice design and a wide snooze bar. The clock also had a self-power backup, so you didn't need to reset it if the power went out. However, setting it up was a bit tricky.
Tom Granger thought the design of this clock radio was tacky and the light was hard to position. Paul Bridges liked the idea of the built-in lamp, but found the radio hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and made him feel like he was on a submarine.
We also tested a simple and cheap clock radio that scored points with Tom because it was easy to set up and took up little space. However, it had old-fashioned dial tuning, which he preferred. The radio quality was good, but the tuning was a bit crude.
In the end, we chose the best clock radio based on its features and design. It was a bit tricky to set up, but it was worth it.""

'Hedgehogs are small mammals covered in sharp spines. They can be found in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs have a special way of defending themselves by rolling into a ball when they feel threatened. This works well if they have a lot of spines. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines and are more likely to try to run away from danger. They use their rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep a lot during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them choose to do so.

It's not easy to be a top athlete, but women have to work even harder. They have to balance their training and competitions with their personal lives, which can be difficult. Despite these challenges, many women are achieving great things in their sports. Here are some inspiring stories of six British women who are making a name for themselves.
Jill, a 27-year-old skier, loves the feeling of flying down the slopes, but it's not without its risks. ""It's scary sometimes,"" she says. ""But I get on with it."" She has to give up a lot of her social life and friends to train for 10 months a year.
Caroline, a 22-year-old cyclist, started racing two years ago. She won a charity race and realized she was good at it. ""I'm well paid now, but I worry that people think I'm successful because of how I look, not because I'm a good cyclist."" She trains for four hours a day and has to make sacrifices, but it's worth it.
Annabel, a 26-year-old rower, found it hard to get into the sport because few girls' schools offer it. She started late and had to work hard to catch up. ""Rowing is great fun, and I love being fit,"" she says. ""And there's a good social life.""
Ffyona, a 24-year-old long-distance walker, has always loved walking. She walked around the world and set a record. ""It was the hardest experience of my life,"" she says. ""But I did it.""
Lisa, a 26-year-old saloon car racer, faces challenges on the track and off. ""Some men think I'm not as good as them, so they try to beat me,"" she says. ""But I'm determined to succeed.""
Alison, a 28-year-old triathlete, trains hard every day. She swims, cycles, and runs. ""It's not easy, but it's worth it,"" she says. ""I'm happier when I'm fit, and I love the social side of racing.""
These women are breaking barriers and achieving their goals. They're showing that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.""

I met Picasso when I was 18 years old and had just finished school. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco with a friend in a old van. We didn't have much money, so I took a job painting boats on the waterfront in Cannes. One day, I was sitting at a café when I saw Picasso eating lunch with his wife and some friends. I was surprised because I had heard he was a reclusive person who didn't like to be seen in public. I decided to approach him and ask for his autograph. To my surprise, he agreed and even drew a picture on my sketchbook.
I was so grateful that I decided to ask him if I could draw his portrait. He agreed, and we sat down at his table. He started acting out different expressions, making it difficult for me to draw him. But I persisted, and eventually he relaxed and let me study his face. I was struck by his youthful appearance, despite being 84 years old. His eyes were very intense and seemed to be looking at something in the distance. He was also very private and seemed to be lost in thought, even though he was surrounded by people.
After I finished drawing, Picasso looked at my work and then took the crayon from me. He quickly drew a portrait of me, which was very different from what I had drawn of him. He added a few quick strokes and handed the sketchbook back to me. I was amazed at how easily he had captured my likeness. I thanked him and asked if I could keep the drawing, but he said it was already signed. I was grateful for the experience and the opportunity to meet Picasso.
I made some changes to the text to make it more accessible to a B2 level learner, including:

**Selling Tricks in Shops**
Have you ever walked into a store and left with more than you intended to buy? Many shops use clever tricks to make you spend more. Here are some of their secrets:
**Fresh and Attractive**
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food, so they put it at the entrance of the store. They also use bright colors and nice smells to make you want to buy more. For example, they might have a bakery that smells like freshly baked bread.
**Displaying Products**
The way products are displayed is very important. Shops use computers to see which products are most popular and put them in easy-to-reach places. They also put higher-priced items in these areas to make more money.
**Making You Spend**
Some shops put low-priced items in hard-to-reach places, so you have to pass by more expensive items to get to them. This is a way to make you spend more money. Others put their most popular items far from the entrance, so you have to walk around the store and see other things before you get to them.
**Presentation Matters**
Some shops, like Next, make their products look exclusive by displaying only a few items at a time. This makes you feel like you're getting something special.
**Pricing and Promotions**
Shops use different prices to make you buy more. They might sell some items at a low price to attract you into the store, then sell you other items at a higher price. They also use promotions, like ""buy one, get one free,"" to make you buy more.
**Lighting and Layout**
Shops use lighting to make their products look good. They also use different flooring to guide you through the store and make you walk past other products.
**In-Store Promotions**
Some shops use big pictures or videos to make you want to buy certain products. They might also use special screens in trolleys to show you ads as you shop.
These are just a few of the tricks shops use to make you spend more. Next time you go shopping, see if you can spot some of these tactics!"

Chris Bonnington is a famous mountaineer who climbed Mount Everest in 1985. He also explored new routes in the British mountains and Alps and wrote several books. Robin Knox-Johnston is a sailor who sailed solo around the world in 1968-1969. He broke the transatlantic record and won many awards.
Chris and Robin became friends after Chris asked Robin for an interview for his book about adventure. They decided to go on a sailing and climbing trip to Greenland together. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness while climbing and his ability to make decisions. Robin was a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the boat's engine and toilet.
Chris found the sailing part of the trip boring and difficult, as he is a land lover. Robin, on the other hand, loved the sea and was good at fixing things. The two men had to work together to navigate the boat through ice and climb mountains. Chris was responsible for Robin's safety, which was a big responsibility.
The highlight of the trip was climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral. It was a challenging climb, and Chris was impressed by Robin's determination and willingness to learn. There were some tense moments, but they worked well together and supported each other.
The only time they had a disagreement was when Robin didn't wake Chris for his watch on the boat. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him that it was just a mistake. By the end of the trip, Chris realized that Robin was a kind and sensitive person beneath his tough exterior.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colours. However, the last century is in danger of losing this heritage.
Prehistoric humans ate apples 8,000 years ago. They threw away apple seeds in Britain and left apple remains around their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland, people even dried apple halves for winter. These were small, wild apples that were different from the apples we know today.
The Romans taught the French how to grow fruit, and they took this knowledge to Britain. The British monks developed new apples and introduced the dessert apple, Decio. Most Roman apples didn't grow well in Britain, so the Norman apples became popular.
In the 13th century, several types of apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple that was sold in Oxford markets. However, the country faced droughts, the Black Death, and wars, which reduced apple production and increased imports.
In the 16th century, Henry VIII ordered his chief fruit supplier to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. The supplier returned with new grafts, including the famous Pippins, and grew the first modern orchard in Kent.
Apples became popular in Britain, and settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America.
In the 17th century, John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple seedlings from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was known for his kindness to animals and his religious devotion.
In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer discovered a new apple variety, which he named 'Hawkey'. The apple became popular and was introduced as the 'Delicious' apple. Another famous apple was discovered by Maria Anne Smith, who found a small tree growing in a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and harvested the first major crop of green apples.
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most commercial apples come from just a few varieties. There is a danger of losing the diversity of apples, as many old varieties have been lost. However, consumers are starting to demand more variety, and it is important to protect the natural diversity of apples for the benefit of all.

Richard Nerurkar, a top 10,000-metre runner from Britain, visited the Kenyan high-altitude training camp. The camp is located on the slope of Mount Kenya, the second-highest mountain in Africa. Richard had been training in Kenya for three years, but this was his first time training with Kenyan runners on their home soil. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000-metre race.
Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity. This has been proven by the success of many Kenyan runners. Richard's first race in Kenya was also a historic event - the first international cross-country race to be held on African soil.
Richard noticed that Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport. They have a relaxed attitude, a simple diet, and seem to enjoy competing. However, the most important factor in their success is their training regime. The national team training camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the mountain. The athletes live in basic dormitories and have a strict daily routine. They run three times a day, with a total distance of around 40 kilometres. On Sundays, they have a shorter run of 20 kilometres.
Life at the camp is uncomplicated. They have a simple breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and spend their free time relaxing or running. In the evenings, they take a bath in a nearby stream. Richard left the camp with a new appreciation for Kenyan success, which he believes cannot be attributed to genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. He thinks that the simplicity of the mountain lifestyle, the gruelling training, and the passion for success are the secrets behind Kenya's success in distance running.

Advertising is not as effective as it used to be. The problem is not just the economic recession, but the fact that advertising has not kept up with changes in the way people consume and make purchasing decisions. Advertisers often focus on mass markets and media, but with so many brands and products available, target audiences have become more fragmented. As a result, even big brands rarely target the right people.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30-50 items, but most of these will not be advertised brands. In fact, you probably only buy a few hundred different brands in a year. This is because most people don't buy many different products, and they rarely buy advertised brands.
According to a report, there are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised, but most people only buy a few hundred of these. In fact, the average person buys only 4% of the advertised brands. This means that 96% of all advertising is wasted, because it is not targeting the right people.
When you watch TV, you might see a few commercials for brands you buy or might buy in the future. But most commercials are for brands you don't buy or won't buy. This is because people are not easily swayed by advertising, and most of it is ignored.
Despite the waste, advertising can still be effective. It is a cheap way to reach a large number of people, and it can be targeted to reach the right people. However, advertisers need to be more precise in their targeting to make the most of their advertising budget.

'Charles Clover visits a unique home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which is considered the most environmentally-friendly house in Britain. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale, who are architects at Nottingham University. The house is special because it uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost, and heats itself using waste heat from appliances and the body heat of the family and their two cats.
The house looks like a traditional home, with a clay-tiled roof and burnt-orange brick walls, which was designed to fit in with the local architecture. When you enter the house, you notice that it is very quiet because of the super-insulated walls and krypton-filled windows. The house is also designed to be very efficient, with clever ventilation systems and air-locked doors to prevent heat loss.
The Vales have been interested in sustainable architecture for a long time and wrote a book on the subject in the 1970s. They designed the house to produce no carbon dioxide emissions and to use minimal resources. They even designed their own composting toilets and rainwater collection system.
The house is very energy-efficient and uses only 9 units of electricity per day, which is much less than the average four-bedroom house. The Vales are planning to install solar panels and a generator to produce even more electricity and eventually power an electric car.
The house is also designed to be warm in the winter, with a small wood-burning stove in the hall that is only used on extremely cold nights. The Vales claim that the house is comfortable at a temperature of 18°C, which is lower than usual, because of the lack of draughts and radiant heat loss.
The house was built using local materials and craftsmen, which made it affordable and low-tech. The Vales hope that their design will inspire others to build sustainable homes that are good for the environment.'

'Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was a rational person who believed in science. However, in 1920, he saw some photographs of fairies in a garden and thought they were real. He wrote an article and published the photos, saying that fairies were supernatural wonders. But it wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed that they had faked them. They cut out fairy pictures from a book and placed them among the flowers. The result is a beautiful photo, but it shows that the camera is not always honest. In fact, photography has never been completely honest. Even from the beginning, people have been able to change their photos. Today, we can use computer software to alter our digital pictures, and it's a myth that photography was once completely truthful. From the moment cameras started taking pictures, people were altering reality.'

Blacksmiths have always been important craftsmen. For centuries, they have made things like weapons, tools, and even beautiful decorations. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected, even more than doctors and astrologers. They were the only ones who could make these important items.
In the past, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for famous buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. They also made intricate metalwork for French and Belgian architecture. However, by the 1960s, blacksmiths were no longer needed because machines could do their work more quickly and cheaply. As a result, the art of blacksmithing almost disappeared.
Recently, there has been a renewed interest in decorative architecture and interior design, which has led to a revival of blacksmithing. Many blacksmiths are now creating beautiful and unique pieces of art. The British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is hosting an exhibition to promote the craft. The exhibition features over 250 pieces of ironwork, including bookends, a spiral staircase, and more. The prices range from £90 to over £1,000.
Blacksmiths are no longer limited by traditional techniques and can now use power tools to shape and mold the metal. This has given them the freedom to express themselves creatively. One blacksmith, Alan Dawson, says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because people and blacksmiths have had their eyes opened to the possibilities.""
Many blacksmiths are fascinated by iron because it is a challenging material to work with. It is soft when hot, but hard and rigid when cold. Susan May, a jeweller, says, ""It's magical because it's soft when hot, but becomes really rigid and unmovable when it cools down."" Another blacksmith, Ann Catrin Evans, says, ""I love the fact that steel is cold and hard, and the way it feels like it's there forever.""
Iron has the potential to be used decoratively for many years to come, as long as we don't have to look at too many rusty candlesticks!"

""I QUIT SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. 'Why did you stop now and not earlier?' she asked. I couldn't explain how I suddenly stopped smoking after being a heavy smoker for years. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnosis. I didn't want to stop smoking and I didn't even think about it. I had low blood pressure and a healthy family, and I didn't get sick easily. I went to the session to write an article about other people who were trying to quit. I told the counsellor I wouldn't try to stop, as my motivation was to write the article, not to quit. The session was unusual - we were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was filled with smoke. But I noticed that when we were told to smoke, I didn't want to - and neither did the others. I think what happened was that the idea of quitting made sense to me intellectually. Quitting smoking became a challenge, and the thought of not being a smoker made me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that was just between me and myself. Quitting was easy. The physical cravings went away after a few days, and I didn't have any problems with my work. The only difficult thing was pottering around at home on weekends, which I still find hard. I think I used to smoke to fill my time, and now I have to find new things to do. I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. I have to get used to new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane, where I would have normally smoked.""

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel prize. She should be a well-known figure in Britain, but many people don't know about her. I've been asking friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them haven't heard of her.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a remarkable person who worked in a field that was not well-known to the general public. Her life reflects some of the most important events of the 20th century, such as the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.
When I started researching her life, I found that there were few biographies about her. I also discovered that many scientists don't think their lives are interesting enough to be written about. They think that their work is too complicated and technical for the general public to understand.
However, some scientists are now trying to change this. They are writing books about their lives and experiences, and they are appearing on TV and radio shows. This is helping to make scientists more relatable and human.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a devoted scientist who worked hard to solve complex problems. She won the Nobel prize for her work on the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12. She also had a personal life, with three children and a husband who was a historian. Her ability to balance her work and personal life is something that many people can learn from.
However, communicating scientific ideas to the general public is a difficult task. Scientists need to find a way to explain their work in a way that is easy to understand. This is not just about explaining complex ideas, but also about conveying the passion and excitement of scientific discovery.
It is sad that many people are not familiar with the work of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. She was a remarkable person who made important contributions to science, and her life is worth learning about."

Farmers whose wells have dried up often hire her to help them find new sources of water. Margaret works with her husband, who uses modern technology to drill wells. But when it comes to finding water, Margaret relies on her special skill.
Dowsing, the ability to locate water and other things underground, is a mysterious skill. Some people think it's related to the vibrations of the Earth. Margaret and her husband have a high success rate, finding water more than 90% of the time.
During the recent drought, Margaret's business has been very busy. She has a long waiting list of customers, including farmers, homeowners, and developers. She tries to find water at depths of 50-70 meters. To do this, she uses a map and a pendulum to narrow down the search area, and then uses her hazel stick to locate the exact spot where she should drill.
Margaret's method is unique and has been studied by anthropologists and writers. They are fascinated by her ability to sense the environment and find water accurately. Without her special skill, Margaret and her husband wouldn't be able to run their business successfully.

**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
**What Makes a Good Leader?**
A leader is someone who inspires and motivates others. It's not about being tall or smart. A good leader shows the way forward and makes things happen through enthusiastic and interested people. To be a good leader, you need to be able to speak clearly and confidently, and make decisions with conviction.
**Everyone Can Be a Leader**
Most people have the potential to be leaders, but they may not recognize it. To become a leader, you need to develop your skills and use them. We all have the ability to lead, but we need the right circumstances to do so.
**The Difference Between Leaders and Managers**
Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path. A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a company. Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills.
**Tips for Becoming a Better Leader**
* Find your passions and convictions and act on them.
* Think of yourself as a leader and recognize your abilities.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from your mistakes.
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but don't feel like you need to lead all the time.

**Films on Video**
Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases.
A. **The Abyss**
This film is about oil riggers and navy experts who try to rescue a submarine that's stuck underwater. The director, James Cameron, made this movie before he made **Titanic**. The film is a thriller and has a lot of action. The characters are brave and have a sense of humor, like the heroes in movies by director Howard Hawks. The special effects and production design are impressive. However, the dialogue and character development are not as good.
B. **The Thin Red Line**
This film is based on a novel by James Jones and is about a battle in World War II. The director, Andrew Marton, made a more traditional war movie than the director of the newer version, Terrence Malick. Marton's film is more faithful to the book and focuses on a single soldier and his relationship with his sergeant. While Malick's film is more poetic and complex, Marton's version has its own moments. One memorable scene is a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.
C. **On Guard**
This film is a swashbuckling adventure set in the 18th century. It's loosely based on a novel by Paul Feval. The film has a good villain and a hero who is brave and fun to watch. The film-makers use costume drama clichés, but they do it in a way that's entertaining. The film is a bit corny, but it's enjoyable.
D. **Character**
This film is a drama set in the early 20th century in Rotterdam. The production design and costumes are very detailed, but the film is a bit slow and serious. The main character is a cruel bailiff who is mean to his tenants. The film focuses on his relationship with his son, but the story is not as strong as it could be.
E. **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This classic Western film has been re-released on video. The sound effects are impressive, and the music is great. The story is violent and intense, and the characters are all morally ambiguous.
F. **The Longest Day**
This war epic has a big cast of stars and was directed by four different directors. The film is about the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II. The early parts of the film are a bit slow, but the action scenes are impressive. The film is better suited to the big screen, but it's still enjoyable on video.

BOOK A Steve Martin's Compelling Evidence is a great book. The main character is a lawyer who has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial is exciting and you're not sure what will happen until the end. This is a great debut book in a popular genre.
BOOK B Curtains for the Cardinal is a thrilling book that takes place in the Italian Renaissance. The main character, Sigismondo, is a troubleshooter for the aristocracy and gets caught up in a complicated web of politics, intrigue, and murder. Although the book is a bit too long, it's still very engaging.
BOOK C File Under: Deceased introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, a tax inspector who becomes involved in a murder investigation. Leah is a strong and determined character who is not afraid to take risks.
BOOK D Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker is a classic detective story about a private investigator named Spenser who helps his friend Hawk to clean up a troubled neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is fast-paced and witty, and there's more philosophy than usual in this book.
BOOK E False Prophet by Faye Kellermann features a pair of detectives investigating a burglary at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's writing style is easy to follow and the characters are interesting.
BOOK F Husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock wrote Blood Red, Snow White, a suspense novel about a lawyer who defends a client accused of murder. The story is full of romance, money, and violence, and it's hard to put down.
BOOK G Dead for a Ducat by Simon Shaw is a comedy about an actor named Philip Fletcher who is supposed to star in a movie about Robin Hood. However, things don't go as planned and Philip becomes the target of a series of mishaps.
BOOK H Fall Down Easy by Lawrence Gough is a detective novel about a bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The book builds up slowly and the portrayal of the robber is very well done, making it a standout in the genre.

Tim Pozzi, a 34-year-old man, has decided to leave his job and go backpacking. He's thinking about why he and others his age are making this choice. I'm 34 years old and I've decided to leave my job to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm nervous. I've traveled before, but this time I'm doing it alone.
I used to work and had a steady income, but I realized I was sacrificing my happiness for money. When I quit my job, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. Many of my friends are married with children and they're jealous of my freedom. I'm not in a relationship and I don't have big career goals. I feel like I should make the most of my freedom, even if it's just for my friends' sake.
I'm worried about making arrangements, like finding someone to rent my flat and organizing my trip. I've also been putting it off because I'm not sure if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among young backpackers?
Many people in their late 20s and 30s are taking a break from their normal lives to travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that people are realizing that adventure is available to them whenever they want. They just need to be brave enough and organized enough to take the chance.
Danny and his girlfriend Tammy are taking a year off to travel around the world. They're willing to give up job security to have this experience. Matt, who used to be in the Army, traveled for a year and it helped him change his perspective.
There are many reasons why people are traveling at this stage of their lives. Some are taking a break from work, while others are looking for a change. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says that more people are working on short-term contracts, so they have more freedom to travel. Some companies are even offering career breaks.
Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, says that many people in their 30s are reassessing their lives and looking for a change. Travel offers a chance to take a step back and think about what they want. Is giving up the comfort of a steady job and a routine just a sign of our generation's inability to grow up? Jennifer Cox doesn't think so. She says it's a sign of a more educated and stable society that people are taking the time to ask if this is what they really want.
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is heading to Central America for a year. He doesn't think he's running away from anything, but rather towards something. He's excited about the adventure, but also worried about leaving behind his comfortable routine.
I share Ben's concerns about leaving behind a predictable life with few challenges. I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't had a bad boss. As Jennifer Cox points out, often there's a catalyst, like a break-up or a job loss, that pushes people to take the leap. Whatever the outcome, I'll be happy to have taken the chance and grabbed life by the horns."

I decided to leave my job as a journalist for a few years to focus on my family. But when I turned 37, I realized that I needed to get back to work. I looked at my CV and saw that I was stuck in the past - I didn't know how to use a computer. Most job ads asked for experience with desktop publishing, which I didn't have. I felt like I was at a disadvantage.
I was a bit of a technophobe - even using a pocket calculator was a challenge for me. But I knew I had to learn. So, I entered a competition and won a computer package, which included a laptop and a personal computer for my family. We started using the computer and soon we were chatting with people all over the world via the internet. My children were already familiar with computers from school, but I was more hesitant. I was worried that I would make a mistake and lose all my work.
However, I persevered and learned the basic skills I needed. I even started freelancing for a magazine and writing two articles a month. I was able to work from home and take care of my children at the same time. The computer has been a game-changer for me. It's helped me stay organized and efficient, and I can now research stories and communicate with other journalists easily.
Working from home has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, I can be isolated from human contact and there are distractions at home. On the other hand, I have more time with my family and can work at my own pace. There are many people like me who have started working from home and it's becoming a growing trend. According to a report, most people who work from home are well-educated and have a computer and other technology at their disposal. I'm one of the lucky ones who has made the transition successfully.

'The National Museum of Scotland is a modern building in the historic city of Edinburgh. The building's unique design has been praised by some, but others have been less impressed. Now that the museum is almost ready to open, it's time to see what's inside. The museum tells the story of Scotland's history through a collection of precious objects. The exhibits are arranged in a way that helps visitors understand the timeline of events, but doesn't overwhelm them with too much information. The museum's goal is to make the visit a pleasant and engaging experience for everyone, not just experts. The head of exhibitions, Dr. David Clarke, believes that the museum should show the truth about the past, without using mock-ups or reconstructions. This means that what you see is what the experts know.
The museum has a unique layout, with galleries of different sizes and shapes. The walls are made to look like stone, and there are windows that let in natural light. The museum also has a special area for children, called the Discovery Centre, where they can learn and have fun. The museum's top floor is dedicated to the 20th century, with objects that have had a big impact on Scottish life. The Prime Minister even suggested an electric guitar as one of the items to be included! Overall, the museum's goal is to make history come alive through the objects on display. The building's modern design works well from the inside, but some people may still have mixed feelings about its location.'

Here is the simplified version of the text for a learner of level B2 on the CEFR:
""The end of print newspapers may take some time. Some people might find the idea of change frightening or challenging, but transition means moving from one place to another in a smooth and gradual way. However, the transition of newspapers to the online world is a different story. It's an uncertain and uncomfortable process because it may not happen at all. Many people think it will happen eventually because newspaper sales are decreasing while website visits are increasing. But there are some things that don't quite fit this picture.
For example, although newspaper sales are down, the number of people reading news and current affairs magazines is increasing. In fact, some magazines have seen a 5.4% rise in sales. The same is true for books. Although e-readers are popular, the value of physical books sold has only decreased by 0.4%. It seems that people are reading both on screens and on paper.
Some people think that young people have abandoned newspaper reading, but the latest figures show that nearly 5 million people between 15 and 35 still read the main national dailies. Different countries have different stories to tell. In Britain, newspaper sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany and France, the decline has been much smaller.
The media analysts used to think that online advertising would pay for the change and make online newspapers successful. However, this is not happening. Many newspapers have put up paywalls, and the best way to attract paying readers is to offer both print and digital access together. Print advertising is also much more valuable than online advertising, raising between nine and ten times more money. This means that newspaper companies have to maintain both a print and digital presence, which is difficult, complex, and expensive. Despite this, newspaper brands still have a strong reputation in print, and it's harder to be noticed online.""

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. They can make a picture more engaging than a scene without people. However, photographing people can be challenging because you need to consider many factors, such as their actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of the camera can also affect how they behave.
**Taking Group Photos**
When taking a group photo, avoid straight lines. Instead, ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also ask some to sit or kneel in the front so that everyone's face is visible.
**Posing for Pictures**
People often don't act naturally in front of a camera. They might stiffen up and look unnatural. To relax your subject, suggest a comfortable position, such as folding their arms or putting their hands in their pockets.
**The Right Approach**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can create tension and make people feel uncomfortable. Most people will agree to have their picture taken and are usually flattered by it. However, they might feel self-conscious and need direction.
**Eye Contact**
A picture becomes more interesting if the subject looks directly at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, not necessarily to smile. This will create a natural expression.
**Candid Concentration**
An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can be easier for them and make the viewer feel like they are observing the scene unnoticed.
**Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures can tell us more about the subject than anything else. Look for familiar expressions, such as smiles, winks, or tears, which can convey emotions and create a connection with the viewer.
**Situational Interest**
The background or environment of a photo can add interest and information about the subject. Try to exclude unnecessary details and blur them if necessary. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
**Interaction**
Photos of people interacting with each other, such as talking, laughing, or working together, can be very engaging. Look for contact between the subjects, such as eye contact or physical contact.
**People and Places**
Many photos of people are taken during outings or holidays. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to capture the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so that they form a foreground interest without obscuring the background.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear photo to remember someone, you may want to ask them to pose against a well-chosen background. However, candid photos of events as they happen can be more lively and memorable.

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist who creates paintings that look like real objects. She doesn't like to talk about herself, but she's happy to share her work. In this interview, she talks about her art and how she creates it.
Sarah has been doing trompe-l'oeil for 16 years. She used to work as an illustrator, but she found it wasn't challenging enough. She then worked with a decorator who specialized in trompe-l'oeil, and that's when she discovered her passion for it. She loves the process of creating an illusion that's so realistic it looks like you can reach out and touch it.
Sarah believes that you can't learn trompe-l'oeil from someone else. It's all about observation and attention to detail. She's always learning and improving, and she thinks that once you think you've mastered something, it's time to move on.
Sarah's work is in high demand, and she's worked on many big projects, including a ceiling in a castle. She's very humble and doesn't like to brag about her skills. She thinks that art should speak for itself, and she's happy to let her work do the talking.
Sarah's trompe-l'oeil paintings are often inspired by architecture or designed for specific spaces. She loves working with clients and coming up with ideas together. She believes that trompe-l'oeil should be personal and engaging, and she's always looking for ways to make it more interesting.
Despite her humility, Sarah's work is impressive, and she's constantly busy. She's grateful for her clients and the opportunities she's had."

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**
The way we work is changing. We are no longer judged only on our intelligence, skills, and qualifications. Now, our ability to work well with others and handle ourselves is also important. This is especially true when choosing who to hire or promote. The new rules focus on personal qualities like initiative, empathy, and persuasiveness - what we call emotional intelligence.
In today's job market, where job security is uncertain, personal qualities play a big role. We need to be able to work well with others and manage our own emotions to be successful. Emotional intelligence includes being aware of our own feelings and those of others, regulating our emotions, and using them to make good decisions.
Some people think emotional intelligence means being nice all the time, but it's not always about being nice. It's about knowing when to be direct and honest, and when to be kind. It's also about managing our emotions so we can work effectively with others.
More and more companies are recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence in their employees. In fact, it's essential for success in many jobs, especially those that require teamwork and customer service. Emotional intelligence can be developed over time, and it's an important part of personal growth and maturity.
Emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success, but it's an important ingredient. If we ignore it, other aspects of our work may not work as well as they could.

Research shows that many people would take photos or videos of a news event. This means that photos and videos from the public will be important in the future of news.

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice that is over 2,000 years old. It is based on the idea that the body has a flow of energy, or Qi, that needs to be balanced for good health. Practitioners believe that when the flow of Qi is blocked or imbalanced, it can cause illness or pain.
During a consultation, an acupuncturist will examine your pulse, tongue, and overall appearance, and ask about your medical history, lifestyle, and state of mind. They will then insert fine needles into specific points on the body to stimulate the flow of Qi and restore balance.
There are over 300 points on the body that can be used for acupuncture, and the points are related to specific energy pathways, or meridians. People often report a gentle, tingling sensation when the needles are inserted, which is a sign that the Qi is flowing properly.
While some doctors in the West may not fully understand the traditional Chinese theory behind acupuncture, many have found that it can be effective for pain relief. Some scientists believe that acupuncture works by blocking pain signals to the brain or releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals.
Acupuncture is used to treat a range of conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is often used as a last resort for people with chronic pain, and can be especially helpful for those who have not found relief with other treatments.
In recent years, acupuncture has been used as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery, particularly in China. This has helped to increase its acceptance among Western doctors. While some people may be hesitant to try acupuncture, it is generally considered safe and can be an effective way to manage pain.
As with any complementary therapy, it can be difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture through clinical trials. However, many people report that it works well for them, and acupuncturists generally quote a success rate of 50-80%.
Overall, acupuncture is a holistic approach to health that views the body as a whole, rather than just focusing on specific symptoms. It can be a valuable addition to traditional Western medicine, and can help people find relief from chronic pain."

She also enjoys books by men like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, who she thinks were great writers.
P.D. James didn't become famous until later in life. When she was 42, her first crime novel was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11. She met her husband at the university and always loved the place. That's why she chose it as the setting for one of her books.

She didn't have time to write, but she used her organizational skills to work in administration for the National Health Service. She even managed five psychiatric outpatients' clinics and worked in the Police Department and the Home Office. She became used to seeing dead bodies, but it wasn't the death itself that inspired her. It was the way a crime novel is structured that appealed to her.

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is becoming more popular. In some countries, employers ask job applicants to write a sample of their handwriting. This can help decide whether they are suitable for the job. Researchers believe that handwriting can reveal a person's character, health, and even psychological state. For example, it can show if someone has heart disease or cancer. Handwriting analysis is used to help with job interviews and to find the right person for a job.
Some companies employ graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential employees. These experts can tell a lot about a person's personality, such as whether they are honest, reliable, or devious. They can also detect signs of mental health problems, like depression or anxiety.
Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes that handwriting is a powerful tool. She says it can reveal a person's social class, intelligence, and even their potential. She claims that handwriting can show whether someone is likely to be successful in arts or sciences, or if they have a troubled past.
Graphology can also be used to detect criminal tendencies. According to Marne, criminals often have poor handwriting and may have arrested emotional development. She says that graphologists can even predict whether someone is about to commit a crime or has suicidal tendencies.
However, not all experts agree with Marne's claims. Some psychiatrists think that handwriting is just a product of education and artistic ability, and has no deeper meaning.

Ergonomist: The furniture is a bit of a mix. Some of it is not very good for working, and many chairs are old and broken. However, the people here have a varied work schedule, which helps prevent boredom and fatigue.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff love the variety of work and the flexibility of the office space. They said it's just the right size - small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but big enough to have some alone time.
Office B: This office is comfortable and well-maintained. The air is good, and there's no smoking allowed. The furniture is good quality, and the space is well-planned. However, it's a bit impersonal and lacks stimulation.
Ergonomist: The chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. However, the layout could be improved, and the walls are bare.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff are generally happy, and relationships are good. However, the office could be improved with more decorations and ways to share information.
Office C: This office is a bit mixed. It feels like a showcase, with many similar offices nearby. Despite the mix of smokers and non-smokers, the air is good. The furniture is adequate, but not inspiring.

'Chewing Gum: A Global Phenomenon
Chewing gum is a popular habit that has been around for thousands of years. In ancient times, people chewed on tree resin to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Today, Americans alone chew 12 million sticks of gum every day.
Chewing gum is a food, so it must meet certain standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration. Most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resin and softeners to give it a pleasant taste and texture.
The history of chewing gum dates back to ancient Greece, where people chewed on a resin from the mastic tree. In North America, early colonists chewed on resin that formed on spruce trees. Later, in the 1800s, chewing gum became a commercial product in the United States.
In the late 1800s, a new type of gum was discovered in Central America, made from the sap of the sapodilla tree. This gum was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, and it quickly became popular. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have been unsuccessful.
Today, most chewing gum is made from synthetic materials, as the demand for natural chicle has decreased. The few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, face many challenges, including poisonous snakes and insects, to collect the sap.
Despite the challenges, the chewing gum industry continues to grow, with manufacturers finding new ways to market their products. Some claim that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay, and research is ongoing to develop new textures and flavors.
In the United States, a significant amount of land is dedicated to growing mint, which is used in many popular chewing gums.'

The receptionist was not paying attention to a potential guest and didn't even acknowledge them. Sue thought this was a bad start.
The hotel had three red stars, which means it was one of the best 130 out of 4,000 hotels in the guide. However, the entrance was not what Sue expected. There was no one to help her get in, and the corridor was long and empty. When she arrived at the reception, the staff didn't have her booking information.
Sue found some other problems, such as a room that was too hot and had a hole in the wall. The next morning, she met the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, and told him about her findings. He apologized for the mistakes and promised to fix them. Sue suggested that the hotel should improve the way they welcome guests and make sure the rooms are ready.
Although Sue found some negative things, she also praised some staff members, like Emma and Trudy, who were helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel's food was also good, which helped keep its two-rosette rating. Sue told Greaves that the hotel could get three rosettes if it improved its service and food.
As the hotel inspector, Sue's job is to tell the truth, even if it's hard. She has to write a report about her findings and give it to the hotel manager. The hotel pays to be included in the guide, but it's worth it because it helps them improve. Sue is not going to take away the hotel's red stars, but another inspector will come back to make sure everything is fixed.

**The Seven Summits**
I, Doug Scott, have climbed the highest mountain on each continent. This is my story of adventure and perseverance.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
My climbing partner, Dougal Haston, and I were on the summit ridge when we started talking about sleeping bags. I thought it was strange, as we were alone. Later, I found myself talking to my feet because of the cold. We were worried about the quality of our survival, not just the survival itself. After two days, I realized I couldn't have chosen a better climbing partner than Dougal. We reached the summit, and I felt confident that everything would work out.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
This mountain is known for being the most treacherous. Dougal and I arrived at the base of the mountain and spent four days climbing to the top. We decided to climb 'alpine style', carrying all our gear and food with us. We climbed up a snowy slope to camp under a rocky cliff. The air pressure was lower than expected, making it feel like we were at a much higher altitude. We reached the summit and felt triumphant.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
I was supposed to climb Mt. Kenya, but an unexpected offer took me to Kilimanjaro instead. We got lost in the jungle and had to find a rock pool with water. We tried to climb a direct route, but it was too difficult, so we took a different route to the summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
My wife, Sharu, and I joined a guide, Phil Erscheler, to climb Aconcagua. We decided to take a different route to avoid the crowds. The wind was strong, and we had to hurry to reach the summit before dark.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
Climbing Vinson Massif was a financial challenge, but it helped me realize my dream of climbing the Seven Summits. We traveled to Antarctica and climbed the mountain in extreme weather conditions. The air was clean and invigorating, and we reached the summit within 8 hours.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
Our team assembled in St Petersburg and traveled to Elbrus. We took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to the refuge at 4,200m. The wind was strong, and we had to climb a long ridge to reach the actual summit.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
We climbed Carstensz Pyramid to establish a new route and to spend time with the local Dani people. We were warned about potential dangers, but we were undeterred. We climbed the mountain, and I was given a standing ovation at the summit, my seventh and final summit.
