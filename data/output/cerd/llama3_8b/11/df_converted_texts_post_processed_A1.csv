'Pay for your trash? It sounds like a good idea. But it's not that simple. In many countries, people don't pay for their trash. They just put it in a bin and it gets taken away. But it's not free. The government pays for it. And the more trash people throw away, the more it costs. So, maybe we should make people pay for their trash. This way, they will throw away less and recycle more.
Some towns in the US have tried this. They make people buy a special sticker to put on their trash bags. Only the bags with the sticker get taken away. The people who did this study found that people threw away less trash. But they also found that people just put more trash in each bag. And some people didn't pay and threw their trash away in other places.
The study also found that people in richer towns throw away more trash than people in poorer towns. And people in richer towns don't have time to recycle. So, is it a good idea to make people pay for their trash? It's not that simple. We need to think about it carefully.'

'Work and Life
Theodore Zeldin thinks about how our work life can change. Are we happy with our jobs? Many people are not happy. They feel like they are just doing a job, not doing something they love. Even people who are very good at their job can feel unhappy.
Zeldin wants to find a way to make work more fulfilling. He thinks work should be a way to make us happy and fulfilled, not just a way to earn money. He wants to know how we can make our work more enjoyable and meaningful.
He looks at different jobs and sees how they affect people's lives. He talks about hotels, for example. Hotels can be more than just places to sleep. They can be like a United Nations, where people from all over the world meet and learn from each other. But many hotel workers are not happy. They are not treated well and do not have the chance to use their skills.
Zeldin thinks that work should be a relationship between people, not just a job. He wants people to be able to choose their own jobs and work with people they like. He also thinks that people should be able to talk to each other in a way that is respectful and honest. This is important because it helps us understand each other and feel like we are equal.
In short, Zeldin wants to make work a way to make us happy and fulfilled, not just a way to earn money.'

""TELEVISION: How It Started
A long time ago, ""broadcasting"" meant spreading seeds widely. It's not just a farming idea, but also a way to describe something new and modern. It's about sharing things with many people, like a big harvest. The idea of broadcasting uses a central point, like a big bag of seeds, to spread things out. We want to know why a new technology that sends pictures and sounds was set up in a way that used this idea.
Television is related to other ways of communicating, like the phone and the radio. But it was surprising that it was planned to be a centralised ""mass"" medium from the start. This made sense with the way society was organized and how people lived in the past.
Some people tried to do things differently, but it didn't work out. In the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to make two-way television, like a two-way phone. They wrote articles in magazines and built their own TV transmitters and receivers. But big companies didn't want to let them do it their way, and the idea didn't take off.
Television was also used in public places, like movie theaters, in the 1930s. It was seen as a way to compete with the film industry. In many countries, people watched TV in public places, not just at home.
The idea of people making their own TV shows or using TV in their own way was not very successful. Instead, TV was mainly used to show shows and movies to many people at the same time. This was because it was easy to sell TV sets to many people and make a lot of money.
The way TV was organized was connected to the way society was changing. As people got richer and moved to cities, they wanted to have more entertainment and culture at home. TV was a way to bring this to them. The government also wanted to use TV to reach many people with important information.
The way TV was organized was also connected to the idea of a ""nation"" or a country. TV was a way to bring people together and make them feel like they were part of the same group.
Now, TV is changing, and maybe the idea of ""broadcasting"" will change too. Maybe it will become a different way of thinking about TV in the future."""

'Clutter Sometimes we have too many things, but we never feel safe. It's okay to have some things to make our home comfortable, but sometimes we want more and more. Advertisers try to make us want things we don't really need. They make us feel bad if we don't have something. Try not to look at advertisements next time you're out. They try to make us buy things without us realizing it. We see ads on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the internet. They tell us to buy, buy, buy.

'Music and Theatre
I used to think that opera is mostly a type of theatre. But now I know it's actually more about music. This is good, because music is very important.
I used to work at an opera house and I learned that music is more important than theatre. But I come from a world where theatre is more important. In theatre, the words and the actors are the most important things. There is no one directing the action once the show starts, and the actors and the audience mostly speak the same language.
When people go to a concert or an opera, some people may not know much about music. They might feel a little embarrassed or amazed by how good the performers are. Even people who don't know much about music can appreciate the skill of the performers.
In contrast, people who go to the theatre have different expectations. They don't always understand how hard it is for actors to do their job. They might not be impressed when an actor does a long and difficult speech.
This doesn't mean that people who go to the theatre are more or less generous than people who go to concerts. It just means that the audience and the performers meet on more equal terms in the theatre.
I think music could learn something from theatre about how to connect with the audience. I've seen how a different approach can make a big difference. Music is already a very theatrical thing, full of passion, humor, and emotion. But sometimes the way we present music can make it feel too formal or hierarchical.
There are many people working to make music more accessible to everyone. I think music could be even more special if it was more like theatre, with a sense of risk and adventure. Sometimes this can happen when music is performed in unusual places, like a church or a park. This can be exciting and unexpected for both the performers and the audience.
I love both music and theatre and I want them to both be successful and enjoyable for everyone.'"

People have always wanted a safe and private place to live. This is why we have locks on our doors. Even with new technology, many people still prefer to use a physical key to unlock their doors.

The museum tried to help me understand the art by giving me information about each piece. This made me feel better and I could understand more of the art.

Every Picture Tells a Story
When a book is made into a movie, some things are left out. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be helpful. I worked on a script and I was surprised by how much of the book I could leave out and still get the same message across.
In a book, we need to see and hear things many times to understand. But in a movie, we don't need to see and hear things so much. This is because movies are more like real life. We don't need to be told everything all the time.
Movies can be very exciting. They can take us to a different world and make us forget about our own problems. But when the movie is over, we go back to our own world and forget about the movie.
The place where movies are made is called a studio. It's a big building with many rooms. Each room is used for a different job, like writing or editing. The studio can be confusing for people who don't work there. But the people who work there know where to go.
Many people want to make movies. They can buy books about how to do it and even take classes. Some people make movies for very little money and become famous. Others take a long time to make their first movie.

I remember looking out of the window and seeing the houses go on and on. My mother was a small, strict woman. She was always angry, and I didn't know why. She liked to keep things clean and tidy. She would say things like ""behave properly"" and ""don't touch that."" She had some friends who were also strict and serious. They would talk about boring things like the weather and how hard life is. My mother was very particular about how we behaved. She would get angry if we didn't do what she said. When I was little, I would play on the floor while my mother sat in an armchair. When I was five, I started going to school. My mother would send me with other children in the street. I liked the summer holidays, when we would see people who lived outside our neighborhood. I remember going to a fair once, where we got lemonade and saw a woman trying to sell us something. My mother didn't like it because she thought the woman was trying to trick us. My mother didn't like politicians because she thought they were bad. Sometimes, she would take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at paintings. My mother wasn't very good at making jokes, but once she made one about a Roman soldier.'

There were many houses and shops, and I knew some of the people who lived there. The houses were not all the same, and some were even old and worn out. Over time, some shops had become homes, and some homes had become shops. This was strange and interesting.
I met a man named Rick Gilbert who lived in a big, old warehouse. He had made it into a home and a place to work. He wanted to make sure it was not too empty and open, so he put up a big piece of plastic to divide the space. This made a hallway and a kitchen in the middle of the flat.
Another person, Bruce Chatwin, was a writer who loved to travel. He wrote a book about his travels and made it sound very exciting. But sometimes he made up stories to make it more interesting. He believed that traveling could help us learn about the world and its history.

""The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. We don't know exactly how much warmer it will get or what will happen. But we know that a warmer climate will change the weather all over the world. This will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to live. We need to know what will happen and why.
Scientists have been studying the Earth's temperature for a long time. They know that human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air, which is linked to global temperature. These gases are building up and will continue to affect the climate.
Scientists use computers to predict what will happen in the future. They use laws of physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, and other factors. But their predictions are not exact and are slow and expensive to make.
Most people agree that the Earth will get warmer faster than it has in the past. The predictions suggest that the temperature will rise by 1-3.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. Sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and weather patterns will change. There will be more heatwaves, floods, and droughts.
Climate change will affect the environment and humans. It can change where animals and plants live, and how they grow. This can affect our food, water, and homes. Some areas will be affected more than others. In some places, it will be good, but in others, it will be bad.
Some scientists have found that warmer temperatures have helped some areas grow more food. But in many places, it will be bad. Rising sea levels will flood coastal areas, and many people will lose their homes and jobs. This could create many refugees. The consequences will be very serious, especially for small island nations that could disappear if the sea level rises too much.""

""Art and Life
Art is a special kind of product that exists in the world. But because it exists, it can be hard to understand. This is because art is often seen as something separate from our everyday lives. We think of it as a painting, a book, or a building, rather than something that happens in our daily experiences.
When we look at art, we often focus on the object itself, rather than how it makes us feel or what it means to us. This can make it hard to understand the true meaning of art. Art is often put on a pedestal, making it seem separate from the rest of our lives.
But art is a part of our lives. It is something that happens in the world around us, in the things we do and see every day. To truly understand art, we need to connect it to our everyday experiences.
For example, we might enjoy a movie or a song without thinking about it as ""art"". But if we want to understand why we enjoy it, we need to think about how it makes us feel and what it means to us.
Many people think that art is only for special things, like museum paintings or classical music. But art can be found in many everyday things, like a beautiful sunset or a funny joke.
To understand art, we need to connect it to our everyday lives. We need to see how it is a part of our world, and how it makes us feel and think.""

'Citizen Kane was a famous film made by Orson Welles in 1941. People liked it, but it didn't make a lot of money at first. It was only later, when people watched it on TV, that it became popular. Many people think Citizen Kane is a very good film and it has inspired many people to make their own films. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. He had a great team working with him, including a cameraman, a screenwriter, and a special effects expert.
Welles wanted to make a film about a newspaper owner who was like William Randolph Hearst. He thought this would be a good way to make a film about himself as both the director and the actor. He had a lot of energy and enthusiasm for the project.
Dermot and Carmel Dermot were having breakfast together. Dermot was going to be late because he had to talk to someone at the golf club. Carmel was going to go shopping in town. She was happy to have the day free.
Some people think that job titles are important. A recent study found that many people are jealous of their colleagues' job titles. Most people would rather have a good job title than a pay rise. This is because people want to feel important and special. The truth is that many job titles are just fancy words and don't really mean much.'

I went to Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. I take them for a living. When I see how light falls on something, it makes me feel happy. I believe that one picture can capture the feeling of a moment, a place, or a person. I was in Vienna to take pictures for a book about four cities - London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The book is about the seasons. I took pictures of London in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. 
I was in Vienna because the photographer who was supposed to take pictures there quit. So, I got the job instead. I was staying at a hotel in the old part of the city. I had been to Vienna before, but it was different this time. I was alone and it was cold and snowy. I took a bus to the city and saw the beautiful buildings. I wanted to take good pictures. 
The next day, I went out early in the morning. The snow was still falling, and the main square was empty and white. I wanted to take a picture of the big church, but it was hard. The church is very big and important, but it's also very hard to take a good picture of it. I decided to take a partial picture instead. It was still very beautiful in the snow. 
I love taking pictures because it's like magic. When you take a picture, you don't know what will happen. It's like watching something appear in front of you. That's why I love taking pictures so much."

'A New Art Exhibition in London
The Hayward Gallery in London is a special place. It is usually very serious and quiet. But now it is full of excitement and wonder. The gallery has a new exhibition about art that moves. This art is special because it is not just paintings or sculptures that sit still. It is art that moves or makes us think about movement.
The exhibition is very interesting because it shows us that many artists have been interested in movement for a long time. We can see many different types of art, like paintings, drawings, and films. The curator, Guy Brett, has worked hard to bring all these artworks together.
Some people might not like this kind of art because it is different. But it is good to see something new and exciting. We can learn a lot from looking at these artworks and thinking about why they are special.
Art is important because it makes us think and feel. It is not just about looking at something and saying it is nice or not nice. We can learn about the artist's thoughts and feelings when we look at their art. And we can also learn about the society we live in and why we like certain things.
This exhibition is special because it is not trying to tell us what to think. It is just showing us many different artworks and letting us decide what we like. We can enjoy looking at the art and thinking about it in our own way.'

'Metals
A long time ago, people might have started using metals because they liked how they looked. Someone might have found a shiny yellow stone in a river and picked it up. This could be how people first found gold. Because metals are soft, they became very useful. People might have also found copper by accident. Once they knew how useful copper was, they looked for more and tried to get it out of the ground.
St Ives
We walked down a small street in St Ives on a very windy day. The streets were empty and the windows of the houses were closed. We had taken a train to get there and the weather was getting worse. I had promised my friend that we would have nice walks and warm fires. But now it didn't seem like such a good idea.
Computer Modelling
It's hard to learn about the past because it's already happened. The people who lived a long time ago are dead. We can't ask them questions or try things to see how they would have done it. But we can use computers to create a pretend world and people in it. We can make rules for how they live and see how they behave. We can even change the weather or the number of people and see what happens.'

**Vervet Monkeys**
One day, a group of vervet monkeys was visited by a strange male. He wanted to join their group. The dominant male was not happy about this. He wanted to stay in charge. The dominant male had a clever idea. He made a loud noise to scare the stranger away. The stranger went back to his own group.
The dominant male did this several times. But one day, he made a mistake. He made the loud noise while he was walking across the open ground. The stranger came back and the dominant male had to think of a new plan.
**Cats**
Some people in a small village in England counted how many animals their cats caught. They caught over 1,000 animals in one year. A professor in America thought about this and said that all the cats in Britain must catch 100 million animals every year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in the village.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are important animals for some people. They live near water and eat plants. They move slowly and make loud noises. They like to swim and rest in the water. They spend their day eating and resting.
**Picasso's Painting**
Pablo Picasso was a famous artist. He painted a picture of fish and a crab. The fish and crab look like they are still alive. The painting is special because it looks like an underwater world. But there is also a feeling of danger and violence in the picture.

'Photography is a way to capture pictures of things that happen. It has been around for about 150 years. During this time, photography has helped us see things that are far away, both in space and on Earth. It has also shown us the good and the bad things that happen in life. Photography is very important because it helps us understand the world and our place in it.
People have been making pictures for a long time. The oldest pictures we know of are from 35,000 years ago. These pictures were made on cave walls and were probably used to tell stories or to help people remember important events.
When photography was invented, people thought it was a special way to capture the truth. They believed that cameras could show us exactly what was happening, just like our own eyes do. This made photography very important and changed the way we think about pictures.
But photography is not just about taking pictures. It can also be used to help us understand different cultures and ways of life. For example, photographs can show us what life is like in different parts of the world and help us learn about different customs and traditions.
In the past, photography was mostly used to record important events and people. Now, it is used for many different things, like telling stories and sharing ideas. Photography can even help us make positive changes in the world by showing us the problems that need to be solved.
Overall, photography is a powerful tool that helps us understand the world and our place in it. It can be used for many different purposes, and its importance will continue to grow in the future.'"

**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry is like playing a game. You need to be careful and not make mistakes. Some people like to plan what they write, while others like to write freely. There is no right or wrong way to write poetry. The most important thing is to listen to your own voice and let your imagination run free.
**The Short Story**
A short story is like a small puzzle. You need to use the right words to make it work. Don't put too many characters or too much information in the story. Use flashbacks to help the story move forward, but don't stop the action. Dialogue is a good way to make the story interesting and easy to follow.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to plan ahead and think about the big picture. It's not just about making individual moves, but about seeing the whole game. The more you practice, the better you'll become at writing a screenplay.
**Looking at Writing**
Writing is not natural for humans like speaking is. We learn to write by inventing writing systems and practicing. Children learn to speak without lessons, but they need help to learn to read and write. We need to understand how children learn to write and how to make it easier for them.

Here is the rewritten text at the A1 level:
I'm not sure if I should write this book. It's not a typical story with a beginning, middle, and end. It's about a man I knew a little bit, and I don't know what happened to him between our meetings. I could make things up to fill in the gaps, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write what I know.
I've changed the names of the people in the story to protect their privacy. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and maybe he never will be. But maybe his way of living and his kind heart will have an impact on the people around him, and people will remember him after he's gone.
I've written down conversations I had with this man, but I didn't take notes. I have a good memory, so I'm sure what I wrote is true. I've also added some things that I didn't hear, but they sound like things he might have said. I did this to make the story more interesting and believable.
I'm a bit worried about writing about people from another culture. It's hard to really know someone from a different country. We are all shaped by where we grow up, the food we eat, the games we play, and the books we read. You can't learn all that just by talking to someone - you have to live it yourself. That's why it's hard to make people from another country believable in a book. I've never written about people from another country before, so I'm not sure if I can do it well. But I've tried to be honest and write what I know.

""POETRY RECITALS
In the past, people often thought that the world of poetry was confusing. But when we look back, we can see that there were certain famous poets who wrote great poetry. Today, there are many different kinds of poetry being written. Some poets write poetry that is meant to be read on the page, while others write poetry that is meant to be performed in front of an audience.
There are some poets who are very serious about their work and write poetry that is meant to be read on the page. They want to be taken seriously and want their poetry to be appreciated for its beauty and meaning. These poets might not be happy with poetry readings because they think that the audience might not understand their poetry.
On the other hand, there are poets who write poetry that is meant to be performed in front of an audience. They might write poetry that is simple and easy to understand, and they might perform it with music or other sounds. These poets want to make people enjoy poetry and make it seem fun and accessible.
Poetry readings can be a good way to introduce people to poetry, but it's also important to read poetry on the page. When we read poetry on the page, we can take our time and think about the words and the meaning. We can also look at the words and the rhythm and the way the poet uses language. This can help us understand the poetry better.
Some people think that poetry readings are a good way to make poetry popular and to get more people to enjoy it. They think that if people see poetry being performed, they will be more likely to read it and appreciate it.""

**Oral History**
Some historians use what people say to learn about the past. But it's not always easy. When someone talks about their past, they are influenced by the person asking the questions and the way they think about the past. The person asking the questions can also make the person talk about certain things and not others.
Even if the person asking the questions doesn't ask any questions, just being there can change how the person thinks about their past. The person's memories can be affected by what they have learned from others, like from TV or movies. They might also remember things that didn't really happen or forget important things.
**Animal Science**
There are two ways to study animals. One way is to look at how their bodies work, like how their nerves and muscles work together. The other way is to study animals in their natural habitat and see how they behave.
Some people who study animals in their natural habitat are called ethologists. They want to know why animals do what they do. Other people who study animals in labs are called psychologists. They want to know how animals learn.
**Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you have to learn two things at the same time. You have to learn about the subject and how to do research. It's like learning a new language - you have to learn the words and how to use them.
The social sciences are not just about common sense. Each subject has its own way of studying and its own special ideas. These ideas help us understand people and society better.
**Classical Architecture**
A long time ago, the ancient Greeks and Romans thought about architecture in a special way. They thought it was an art, not just about building houses. They believed that architecture should be beautiful and follow certain rules.
The ancient Greeks and Romans built simple houses and temples, but they also built more complicated buildings that followed their rules. These buildings were important because they showed that architecture was an art, not just a way to build something.

You can really drive!"" Lily was proud of herself.
Lily and Chen planned a trip together. They would go early in the morning and come back by lunchtime. Lily would practice driving around the town before they left. Mui, Lily's sister, was a bit worried, but she wanted to support Lily. Mui even bought a map to help them navigate.

'Online Book Reviews: A New Way to Share Opinions
The internet was meant to be open to everyone. Anyone could share their ideas or music online. But one area where this was especially true was book reviews. Amazon, a big online bookshop, let anyone write a review about a book. This was a new way for people to share their thoughts about a book. Before, people could only read what professional critics said. Now, readers could see what others thought of a book.
Amazon had many rules to keep the reviews fair. For example, they didn't allow one-word reviews or personal attacks on the author. But because there were so many reviews, it was hard to check them all. So, some people took advantage of this and wrote fake reviews. One author even wrote fake reviews to make his book look better.
Some authors used a special link to write comments about their own books. Most of them just wrote nice messages, but some even gave their email address so readers could contact them. However, it was hard to know if the comments really came from the author.
Some readers were upset when they read a book and didn't like it. They wrote bad reviews, but sometimes these were removed. Amazon liked that people were taking the time to read and write reviews, because it helped them sell more books. They wanted to make sure that people could discuss books in a fair way. In the end, most people took the reviews seriously and they helped others decide if a book was worth buying.'"

You'll get a scholarship to a good university.' 'So what?' I said. 'That's good, isn't it?' 'I also heard that you want to be a lawyer,' my dad said. 'A lawyer, of all things!'

'Anyway,' my dad said, 'I think your heart won't be in the family business now. You'll go to university and then I don't think you'll want to work with us.'

Heritage is important because it helps us connect with our past. We learn about our family and where we come from. It's like getting a piece of our history. Our heritage is special because it makes us feel connected to our ancestors and our country. It's like a part of us.
We can learn about our heritage in many ways. We can hear stories from our grandparents, see old buildings, and visit museums. Museums are important because they help us understand the past. They have real objects that are from a long time ago. We can touch and see them.
**The Fens**

Writing Reviews
Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and are only published for a short time. They are often limited to a few hundred words and are only in the newspaper for a day or a week. People think that reviews are not important because they are short-lived. However, writing reviews is a difficult job that requires skill and knowledge.
A good reviewer needs to be able to write clearly and concisely. They must also consider who their audience is and what they want to say. Some reviews are short and simple, while others are longer and more detailed. The reviewer must be able to write in a way that is easy to understand.
Many people who write reviews also write other things. They may write novels or academic books. Some people, like the American novelist John Updike, write reviews in their free time. They like to collect their reviews and publish them in books.
I think that people who write reviews should be allowed to keep their work. They should be proud of what they have written, even if it is not as important as their other work. In the English-speaking world, it is common for academics to write reviews and other types of writing. This is good because it means that readers can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about.
Overall, writing reviews is a challenging job that requires skill and knowledge. It is not always easy, but it is an important part of writing and reading.

'There are some things that cannot be rushed. If you hurry, they will not work. For example, if you add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a fishing line, it will get tangled. Our minds work in different ways too. Some things happen very quickly, while others take a long time. Some things can be done faster, like solving a puzzle or doing math in your head. But some things cannot be rushed. If you try to rush them, they will break or get mixed up. 
Our minds have three different ways of working. The first is very fast and helps us react quickly. The second is slower and helps us think and figure things out. The third is very slow and helps us relax and think deeply. 
We need all three ways of thinking to solve different problems. Sometimes we need to react quickly, like when we see a danger. Sometimes we need to think carefully, like when we are solving a puzzle. And sometimes we need to relax and think deeply, like when we are trying to understand a difficult idea.

""Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. Before, it was hard to find good maps and books about astronomy. Now, there are many telescopes and computers that make it easier to study the stars. But, there are also some problems. The sky is not as clear as it used to be because of planes and pollution. This makes it hard to see the stars at night.
In our busy world, there are too many choices. We have too many things to do and too many things to buy. This can be stressful and make it hard to find what is important.
I like to visit a special hotel in Ireland every summer. It's a family tradition that started with my grandmother. The hotel is special because it's quiet and respectful. The staff doesn't interrupt us and we can have some peace. This is hard to find in other hotels.""

'Othello: A Great Play
I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote about a play called Othello. I thought the actor who played the main character, Othello, was too young. But now I think he did a great job. The whole cast was excellent. Some scenes were very memorable, like when the characters got into a fight or when a character was very sad. The play was very exciting and tense. You should see it.
Lake Vostok
In Antarctica, there is a big lake under a thick layer of ice. It's been hidden for millions of years. Scientists want to explore it and find out what lives there. They are trying to find a way to reach the lake and discover its secrets.
Scientists
Some scientists were talking on the radio about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why they want to learn new things. But I think it's more important to think about what we do with what we learn. We should decide how and why we use science.'

Food is important for us. We like to eat and cook. But sometimes we think cooking is only for special occasions. No, it's not true! You can make a delicious soup with just a few simple ingredients like carrots, leek, and celery. It's better than buying a packet or can of soup. You can also make a yummy dessert like chocolate mousse in just a few minutes. Cooking is a way to show love and care for others. We share food with our family and friends, and it's a special part of our lives.

Writing by hand or on a computer can be different. Dr. Johnson said, ""What is written without effort is not enjoyable to read."" Good writing takes time and effort. When I look back at my old school essays, I was surprised to see how few mistakes I made. Today, I would make many more mistakes.
Writing on a computer is easy, but it can also be sloppy. People often make mistakes and don't take the time to correct them. This is because it's easy to delete mistakes on a computer.
In the past, people wrote letters by hand. This made them think carefully about what they wanted to say. Now, with email, people can write quickly and easily, but they may not think as much about what they're writing.
Some people think that computers will change the way we write. They say that computers will make it easier to write and that we'll write more. But, some people think that computers will make it harder to write well.

Lancelot's secretary, a woman who had been making him coffee for a long time, asked him if he wanted sugar. She didn't really ask, because she knew he didn't take sugar. Lancelot was usually at work, but sometimes he was late because he didn't like to be there too much.
The secretary gave him a folder with a label that said ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert"". Lancelot didn't want to read it. He had already seen a summary of the book and didn't want to see another one. Ian Cuthbert was a writer who had been given a lot of money to write a book. Lancelot had made a mistake by asking him to write the book.
Lancelot read a little bit of the summary, but it was the same as the one he had read before. He closed the folder and put it away. He thought that Ian would never finish the book. The summary was not good and didn't sound like something Ian would write.
Lancelot remembered when Ian was a famous writer. He was known for being difficult to work with. He would often be late or not show up at all. Lancelot thought that asking Ian to write a book was a mistake.

Only rich people, like kings and queens, would have breakfast. But in the 1500s, people started eating breakfast more often. Some people think this is because there was more food available. Others think that the way people worked changed. Before, people didn't work regular hours. They would start work early in the morning, so they needed to eat breakfast to give them energy.'

""Taking Pictures
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show and what to hide. This is because of their skills, what they like, and what they have learned. They also think about what others might think and what is normal.
In this book, we will see how these things affect the picture. We will also see how people react to the picture.
For example, when we look at a picture in a newspaper, we might wonder if it is really what it looks like. Or, we might think about what the photographer wants us to see.

'Birds are very important to humans. We love them, fear them, and sometimes worship them. But what do our feelings about birds say about us? 
In a greenhouse, I saw a small brown bird, a wren, bumping against the glass. It's a special bird in British culture. In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could tell them their luck. Today, people still keep pictures and ceramics of wrens in their homes. The wren is important to us because it's a part of our culture and history.
Birds have been important to people for a long time. In the past, people believed that birds could tell them important things, like when bad weather was coming or where to find food. They also believed that birds could connect them to the supernatural world. 
Now, birds are important to us because they remind us of our connection to nature. We love to watch them fly and sing. We also use birds to measure the health of our environment. If birds are disappearing, it's a sign that something is wrong with the environment.
Birds are also important because of the stories and legends we tell about them. These stories help us understand and connect with the natural world. They are a way to explain the things we don't understand about birds. The stories we tell about birds are like a thread that connects us to the past and the present. They help us make sense of the world around us.'

**Maps**
A map is a picture that shows how things are connected on the Earth's surface. It shows how far apart things are and which way they are from each other. A long time ago, people used to measure distance by how long it took to walk or travel by river. This didn't give much information about the actual distance. The other important thing is direction. For most people, it's more important to know where to go and how far it is than to know the exact direction.
In the past, people used signs to show important landmarks on a route. The way people drew maps changed over time and was different in different places. To understand old maps, you need to know the special rules they used.
The history of maps is about getting better at measuring distance and direction, and adding more information to maps. Cartographers (people who make maps) used science to help them. They used a compass to find direction and special tools to measure angles. They also used astronomy to help them make maps.
As time went on, more people started using maps, like soldiers and archaeologists. They needed maps to be more accurate and detailed. Cartographers had to find new ways to show different things on maps, like where rocks and water are.
Today, we recognize the importance of maps in many sciences. This has led to a new ""map-making"" revolution. Maps are not always correct, so we need to be careful when using them. The many old maps we have today are important records of how people lived in the past. Studying old maps is fascinating and can teach us a lot."

'Language We use language to talk to each other. It's a special skill that we have. We can use it to talk to anyone, anywhere. Even when we're alone, we might talk to ourselves or to our pets. I think language is like an instinct, like how some animals do things without learning. For example, spiders spin webs without being taught.
Climate and Weather The weather and climate affect the world around us. The air around us makes the weather. This affects the plants and animals that live here. For example, hot and wet weather makes big, dense forests. Cold and windy weather makes it hard for some plants and animals to survive.

This means the prices of most metals are half of what they were 20 years ago.
I recently looked into some problems with a big company that uses cheap raw materials.
Abaco and its islands are in the Bahamas. Each island is special and has something to offer. The best way to get around is by boat. If you don't have one, don't worry.

There is a special animal in the forests of Madagascar. It is called the aye-aye. It is very good at finding food in wood. It does this in a way that is similar to a woodpecker. The aye-aye uses its teeth to make a hole in the wood and then uses its long finger to get the food out.
Scientists have been studying the aye-aye to see how it finds its food. They put logs with holes in them in front of the aye-aye. Some of the holes had food inside and some were empty. The aye-aye went straight to the holes with food. It didn't need to look at the holes or smell the food to find it.
The scientists thought maybe the aye-aye was using its sense of smell or hearing to find the food. But it wasn't. They found out that the aye-aye can sense the holes in the wood. It does this by tapping the wood with its finger and listening for the sound. It can also hear the insects moving inside the wood.
The aye-aye is very good at finding food in wood. It is like a woodpecker and a bat combined. It also behaves like a squirrel. It has special teeth that grow continuously, just like a squirrel. It even eats nuts and gets the meat out with its long finger.

Many people have old photos of their grandparents. But do we really know what their lives were like when they were young? We might have some memories, but they are often incomplete. We often think about writing down our stories, but we never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a solution. She writes the stories of ordinary people, not famous people. She talks to them, asks questions, and writes a book about their lives. The book is like a diary, with pictures if they want. 
Hannah started doing this because she realized that her own family's past was disappearing. She talks to people and writes down their stories. They tell her things they might not have told anyone else. They feel comfortable talking to her because she promises to keep their stories secret. 
People are surprised by what they say. They talk about happy and sad things. They talk about things they did wrong and things they wish they had done differently. Hannah helps them organize their thoughts and writes their stories in a book. 
The books are special because they are not just about famous people. They are about ordinary people's lives. Hannah thinks it's important to remember the past so we can learn from it. She wants to help people keep their family's history alive.

As they grew, they started to play and explore. They would chase each other and play with their fur. They even started to go for walks at night. I would take them out and they would run and play. Sometimes, we would see other badgers in the area, but they were not friendly.

'Finding True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet'
Dr. Toby Clark, a scientist at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer. Halley is best known for the comet that bears his name. But he did something very important too. He helped sailors find their way across the ocean by studying how the compass works.
A long time ago, sailors used to get lost because their compasses didn't always point to true north. Halley wanted to fix this problem. He sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to measure how much the compasses were off. This was a big job, but he did it twice. He even wrote a book about his findings.
Now, Dr. Clark wants to follow in Halley's footsteps. He will sail across the Atlantic again to measure the compass and help sailors find their way. He will use special instruments to get accurate readings. This will help us understand the Earth's magnetic field better.
Dr. Clark is a sailor and a scientist. He likes Halley's work and wants to make sure people remember him. He says, ""Halley was a great scientist and explorer. He did many important things, including finding the comet that bears his name.""
The expedition will take four stages, and Dr. Clark will work with different teams. He is excited to do this project and says, ""I am willing to spend eight months at sea to do this. Halley's work has given me a sense of purpose.""

**Peacocks and Their Beautiful Tails**
Every summer, peacocks in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How did these birds evolve such a beautiful feature? Why do the hens like them?
Scientists Marion Petrie and her team are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find the answer. They want to know if the hens really choose the males with the most beautiful tails. And if they do, is it because the males with the most beautiful tails are also the healthiest or strongest?
The scientists have been watching the peacocks and taking pictures. They have found that the hens do like the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. The males with the most eye-spots are the ones that get the most mates.
But the scientists are still not sure if the males with the most beautiful tails are also the healthiest or strongest. They are going to study the babies of the males with the most beautiful tails and compare them to the babies of the males that the hens don't like as much. They want to see if the babies of the more attractive males grow faster or are healthier.
There is also a theory that the beautiful tails of the peacocks are like an advertisement. Maybe the hens choose the males with the most beautiful tails because they know that these males are healthy and strong. This is an idea that was first suggested by a scientist named Alfred Russel Wallace.
The scientists are still working to solve the mystery of the peacocks' beautiful tails. They are using computers to help them understand how the peacocks' tails evolved over time.

'MY DREAM BOAT
Tom Cunliffe, a sailor, thinks that the best boat is one that combines old and new ideas. He built his own boat, ""The Westerman"", and it's very special. This week, there's a big boat show in London with many new boats. Most of them are similar, but my boat is different. It looks old, but it has modern technology inside.
I wanted a boat that is both old and new. I wanted it to be warm and cozy, with a fireplace and comfortable beds. But I also wanted it to be easy to sail and navigate. I didn't want too many gadgets and machines. I wanted it to feel like a real boat, not a house on the water.
I used to have another boat, called ""Hirta"", which I sailed around Britain. It was old-fashioned, but it was very kind to me. It didn't have many modern things like electricity or a fridge, but it was easy to sail. I had to take care of it a lot, but it was worth it.
When I got hurt and couldn't sail anymore, I had to find a new boat. I wanted one that was easy to build and maintain, so I designed and built ""The Westerman"" myself. It's been great so far. It's sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and has won many races. It looks old, but it's actually very modern and strong. It's a great example of how old and new ideas can come together to make something special.'

'Humans and animals are very similar. In fact, we are 98% the same as chimpanzees. This means that the things that make us different from animals must have developed recently. Our bodies and brains are a bit different, but not very much. We use tools, like sticks and rocks, just like some animals. Even monkeys have their own language.
But what about art? Is it something that only humans can do? Some people think that art is something special about humans. But animals can make art too. Chimpanzees, for example, make paintings and drawings. They do it for fun, not to help them survive.
Some people say that human art is different because it is not useful. We don't make art to help us survive or to pass on our genes. But animals make art for the same reason. They make songs and dances to communicate with each other.
Other people say that human art is different because it is made for beauty. But animals make beautiful things too. They sing and dance to make themselves happy, not just to communicate.
Finally, some people say that human art is different because it is learned. We learn to make art from our parents and teachers. But animals also learn from each other. They learn to make their own songs and dances.
So, are humans really special when it comes to art? Or is it just something that animals can do too? Maybe art is not so special after all.'

**Do Book Reviews Help Sell Books?**
We asked five big book publishers in the UK about how book reviews affect the success of a book. Here's what they said.
**Publisher A**
Reviews are very important for publishers. When people buy a book, they often choose it because of what they read in a review. Publishers like it when reviews are good, but they don't mind if some reviews are not so good. They think that a mix of good and not-so-good reviews can actually help sell more books.
**Publisher B**
Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to sell books. Book reviews are better now than they used to be, but there are still some problems. Paperbacks often don't get reviewed as much as hardcover books.
**Publisher C**
Reviews are very important for small publishers like mine. We don't have big authors who sell books without reviews. We need reviews to tell people about our books. A good review can help sell a book, especially if it's written by a famous reviewer.
**Publisher D**
It's hard to understand how reviews affect book sales. Sometimes a good review can help, but sometimes a bad review doesn't matter. Some books are popular even if they get bad reviews.
**Publisher E**
Publishers and writers want good reviews, but do they really help sell books? I published a biography once, and the reviews were great, but the book didn't sell well. Some people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book.

Nicholas Evans wrote a book called The Horse Whisperer. It was his first book and it became very famous. Before it was even published, people were very excited about it. Evans is a screenwriter and he had a hard time getting money for his work. He had to take a big risk to write his book.
Evans had a idea for the story from a man he met on a trip. The man told him about a horse that changed from being friendly to being very mean. The man said that a special person, called a ""horse whisperer"", could calm the horse down. Evans was very interested in this story and he wanted to write a book about it.
Evans went to America to research for his book. He visited farms and met people who worked with horses. He was alone and had no money, but he was determined to finish his book.

I was shy, but my friend encouraged me to go over and ask him for his signature. He said yes, and I showed him my sketchbook. He drew his name on the top page and then added a funny drawing. He was a very good artist, and his drawing was amazing.
My friend told me to go back and draw his portrait. I was a bit nervous, but I went back and asked if I could draw him. He said yes, and he even acted out funny faces for me to draw. He was a very good actor, and it was hard to draw him because he was moving around so much.
After a while, he stopped acting and let me draw him properly. He was a very fit and healthy-looking man, with dark eyes that seemed to see right through me. He was also very quiet and serious, even though he was surrounded by friends.
When I finished drawing him, he looked at it and nodded. Then he took the crayon and drew a picture of a man with a beard. He handed it back to me, and I was amazed at how good it was. He had captured my smile and my nose perfectly.

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more things than you planned? Shops use tricks to make you spend money. Here are some of these tricks:
**A. Fresh and nice**
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance or display them in a nice way. They also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread. This makes people want to buy more.
**B. Where things are placed**
The way shops place things is important. They put popular items near the front and expensive things near the back. They also put things together that go well together, like salad dressing and ice cream.
**C. Spreading things around**
Supermarkets put cheap things like bread and sugar in different parts of the store. This makes people walk past other things they might want to buy.
**D. Making things look nice**
Some shops make their things look special to make people want to buy them. They put limited items on the shelves to make them seem exclusive.
**E. Prices**
Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive things together. They do this to make people buy more. They also use special prices to attract customers.
**F. Lighting**
Shops use lighting to make things look nice. They want people to see the colors and details of the products.
**G. Paths through the store**
Some shops divide their stores into different areas with different carpets. This makes people walk along the paths and see the things they want to buy.
**H. Advertising**
Supermarkets use big pictures and videos to advertise things. They want to make people want to buy them.

Richard Nerurkar is a good runner from Britain. He went to Kenya to train with the Kenyan runners. Kenya is a country near the equator. The runners train at a high place called Nanyuk, which is 10 miles from Nairobi. Richard went to the Kenyan team training camp for the first time. He was invited by the coach because he finished fifth in a big race.
Richard wanted to learn how the Kenyan runners train. They train at high altitude, which makes them better runners. Richard thought this was the reason why they are so good. But he also saw that the Kenyan runners are simple and easy-going. They love to run and they are very good at it.
The Kenyan team training camp is at St Mark's College, which is 6,200 feet high. The runners live with the college students and train every day. They run three times a day: in the morning, in the middle of the day, and in the afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers a day, which is almost a marathon. On Sundays, they only run 20 kilometers.
The runners' days are simple. They wake up at 6 am and go for a run. They eat bread, eggs, and tea for breakfast. Lunch and dinner are the same: ugali (a maize dish), stew, and tea. After dinner, they go to the river to bathe.
Richard was impressed by the Kenyan runners' success. He thought it was not just because of their high altitude training, but also because of their simple and hardworking lifestyle.

Advertising is not working well. It has been getting worse since 1989, even before the economic problems started. The problem is that advertising is not keeping up with the way people live and shop today. Advertisers think about big groups of people, but in reality, people buy different things and like different brands.
Think about your own shopping. You might buy 30-50 things at the supermarket, but most of them are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. Over a year, you might buy around 400 different brands. This is much less than the 32,500 brands that are advertised.
Most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. They might see 15-20 ads, but only remember a few. Advertisers want to reach a small group of people who will buy their product, but they do not know who those people are. They have to advertise to many people to reach a few.
Some people think that advertising is a waste of money. They might see an ad and not buy the product. But advertising can still be effective. It is a cheap way to reach many people. Advertisers can try to target the right people, but they will never know for sure who will respond.
The best way to advertise is to target the right people, but it is hard to do. Advertisers need to find a way to make their ads more effective and reach the people who will buy their product."

'Charles Clover visits a special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. It's a very green house! The house is famous for being very good for the environment. The owners, Robert and Brenda Vale, built it to use less energy and water. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and they recycle their waste water to make compost for their garden. They even heat their house with the warmth from their bodies and their appliances!
The house looks like a normal house from the outside, but it's very special inside. It's very quiet because it's well-insulated, and there are no drafts. The Vales are very careful about the environment. They wrote a book about building green houses a long time ago. They wanted to show people that it's possible to build a house that doesn't harm the environment.
The house uses very little energy and water. They don't have a dishwasher because they don't like using strong chemicals. They also don't have a big water bill because they collect rainwater. They even have a special system to make their own electricity! The house is very comfortable and warm, even in the winter. The Vales are very happy with their special house and want to show others that it's possible to live in a green way.'

""Arthur Conan Doyle, the man who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a rational person. But in 1920, he saw some photos of fairies in a garden. He thought they were real. He wrote an article and put the photos in it. He said fairies were special and magical. Later, the two ladies who took the photos said they were fake. They just cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them in the garden. The photos are still pretty, but it's not honest. This shows that even in the past, photos weren't always true. We can now change our digital photos with computers, so it's not true that photography was once honest. From the beginning, people changed what they took pictures of.""

Blacksmiths have always been important people. They make things from iron. A long time ago, blacksmiths were very powerful. They made weapons, armor, and tools for farming. People respected them like doctors and astrologers. In the past, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for important buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. Now, there is a new interest in decorative architecture and interior design. This means that blacksmiths are becoming popular again. There is even a group called the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) that shows off the work of blacksmiths. The group has an exhibition at a gallery in Surrey. The blacksmiths can make many things, from small objects to big pieces like a spiral staircase. They use special tools to shape the metal. The blacksmiths are happy to be able to express themselves with their work. They think iron is a special material that allows them to be creative. Some blacksmiths like working with iron because it is soft when hot and hard when cold. They like the feeling of making something that will last a long time. Iron has been used for decoration for a long time, and it will probably continue to be used for a long time."

'I STOPPED SMOKING ONE DAY I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my friends was very angry. 'Why did you stop now?' she asked. I didn't know what to say. I went to a special meeting to help people stop smoking. It was two months and three weeks ago. I didn't want to stop smoking, but I went to write an article about other people who were trying to quit. I told the counsellor I wasn't going to try to stop, but she looked at me strangely. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was very smoky. But when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to. I think it was because the idea of not smoking made sense. I started to feel powerful. It was easy to stop smoking. I didn't feel the need for cigarettes after a few days. I thought I wouldn't be able to work without cigarettes, but it was okay. The only hard part was doing nothing on weekends. I miss cigarettes a little, but not too much. Now I have to find new things to do in situations where I would usually smoke.'

Do you know who Dorothy Hodgkin is? She was a British scientist who won a very important prize called the Nobel Prize. But many people in Britain do not know about her. I think she should be famous in her own country. I have been asking my friends about her, and most of them do not know who she is.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a very special person. She studied crystals and was very good at it. Her life was interesting because she lived through many important events in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and the spread of science around the world.
When I started researching her, I looked for books about her. But I found that there were no books about her. I think this is strange because many people know about other famous scientists. Even scientists themselves do not think that writing about scientists is interesting. They think that only artists and writers have exciting lives.
But this is not true. Scientists can have very interesting lives too. They just have to work hard and be very careful about what they say and do. Some scientists are now appearing on TV and in newspapers, which is helping people to see them as real people.
I want to write a book about Dorothy Hodgkin because I think she is an important person. She was very good at her job and was very dedicated to her work. She also had a family and was married to a historian. Her life is interesting because she was able to balance her work and her family.
I hope that my book will help people to learn more about Dorothy Hodgkin and appreciate the work of scientists. Scientists are very important because they help us understand the world and make new discoveries. We should learn more about them and appreciate their work."

Margaret Wilkins is a woman with a special skill. She can find water underground. She uses a special stick to do this. The stick is made from a forked hazel tree branch. When she is above water, the stick moves up and down. This tells her where to dig a well.
Margaret and her husband run a business drilling wells. They use machines to dig deep holes. But when it comes to finding water, Margaret uses her special stick. She has been doing this for a long time and is very good at it. Most of her customers are farmers who have dry wells. They need water for their crops.
Margaret says that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. She thinks that she can feel these vibrations when she is standing on the ground. Some people say that she can smell the water, but Margaret says that's not true.
Margaret's customers come from all over. They want her to find water for their homes, farms, and businesses. She has to be careful where she digs the wells because she doesn't want to find dirty water. She also needs electricity to pump the water up to the surface.
Margaret uses a special technique to find water. She starts by looking at a map and using a pendulum. Then she walks over the area with her stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot where she should dig the well.
Margaret's husband also uses the stick, and they usually agree on where to dig. If they don't agree, they don't dig and keep looking until they do. Margaret says that she has a special way of understanding the environment, and that's why she can find water so easily."

Some experts say that newspapers will disappear soon, but this is not true. Many people still like to read newspapers in print. In fact, some people read both the paper and the website. This is good for the newspapers because they can make more money from both.
Newspapers are also important for advertising. They can make more money from advertising in the paper than on their website. But it's hard for newspapers to keep both the paper and the website going. They need to spend a lot of money to do this.
Newspapers are still popular in many countries. In some countries, like Germany and France, people are still buying and reading newspapers. In other countries, like the UK, the number of people reading newspapers is going down.
Some newspapers are trying to make money by asking people to pay for their website. But this is not working well.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for learners at the A1 level of the CEFR:
**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting things to take pictures of. A picture with someone in it is usually more interesting than one without. But taking pictures of people is also very difficult. You need to think about how they are standing, what they are doing, and how they are feeling.
**Group Pictures**
When taking a picture of a group of people, don't make them stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front to make it easier to see their faces.
**Posing for Pictures**
People usually don't act naturally in front of a camera. They might look stiff and uncomfortable. Try to make them feel more relaxed by suggesting they do something natural, like folding their arms or putting their hands in their pockets.
**Looking at the Camera**
If you want the person in the picture to look directly at you, ask them to look into the camera lens. This will make the picture more interesting. But they might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture.
**Candid Shots**
Another way to take a good picture is to have the person focus on something in the picture. This can be easier for them, and you can still get a good shot. Candid shots are very interesting, and the person's expression is important.
**Faces and Gestures**
The way someone looks and the things they do with their body can tell us a lot about them. A happy child can make us smile, while a sad expression can make us feel sad. Look for natural expressions and gestures in your pictures.
**Background and Situation**
The background or situation in a picture can add interest and tell us more about the person. Try to make the background not too distracting, and make sure the person is not too small compared to the background.
**Interacting with Others**
When taking pictures of people interacting with each other, look for moments of contact, like eye contact or physical touch. These can make the picture more interesting.
**People and Places**
When taking pictures of people in a new place, try to show them against a relevant background. Use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to get the whole scene in the picture. Ask the people to come close to the camera, and compose the picture so that they are the main focus.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear picture to remember someone, you might ask them to pose. But if you want a more natural picture, try to take it when they are not expecting it.

Sarah Janson is an artist who makes paintings that look real. She doesn't sign her name unless someone asks her to. Sarah doesn't like talking about herself. She thinks the most important thing is the art, not the artist.
Sarah has been doing trompe-l'oeil paintings for 16 years. She learned drawing and illustration at school and worked in a publishing house. But she didn't like illustrating, so she started doing trompe-l'oeil. She worked with a good artist named Jim Smart, and he asked her to do one trompe-l'oeil painting. That was it. Sarah loved it and decided to work on her own.
Sarah's skills in drawing and observing details helped her with trompe-l'oeil. She thinks that nobody can teach you how to do trompe-l'oeil. You have to learn by observing the world.
Sarah is still learning and making mistakes. She says that when you think you're good at something, you should stop. She is honest about her mistakes and doesn't like to talk about herself. She thinks that her art should speak for itself.
Sarah has done many big projects, like painting a ceiling in a big castle. She got confused with the measurements, but she learned from it. Sarah's art is special, and she has many happy clients. She likes working with clients and getting to know them. She thinks that trompe-l'oeil should be personal and special for each client.

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**
**The New Rules of Work**
The way we work is changing. We are no longer judged only on how smart we are or how well we know our job. Now, we are also judged on how well we work with others and how we handle our feelings.
**What is Emotional Intelligence?**
Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control our own and others' feelings. It helps us make good decisions and work well with others. There are five basic parts to emotional intelligence: being aware of ourselves, controlling our emotions, being motivated, understanding others, and being good at relationships.
**Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?**
Emotional intelligence is important because it helps us work well with others and make good decisions. It is especially important in jobs that involve teamwork and working with customers. Without emotional intelligence, even smart and skilled people can struggle to succeed.
**Can We Learn Emotional Intelligence?**
Yes, we can learn emotional intelligence. It is not just something we are born with. We can develop it as we grow and learn from our experiences. This is important because it means we can improve our emotional intelligence at any age.
**Conclusion**
Emotional intelligence is an important skill for success in the workplace. It helps us work well with others and make good decisions. We can learn emotional intelligence and improve it as we grow and learn from our experiences."

""Should the media take pictures and videos from people without asking? With phones and cameras, it's easy to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed the way we share news. Journalists now use social media to get pictures and videos quickly. But some journalists take pictures and videos from people without asking. This is a problem. Some people think it's okay to take pictures and videos from social media if it's very important or if many people are interested. But others think it's not right. Many people would take pictures or videos of important events. We need to make sure people are paid for their work and ask permission before using their pictures and videos.""

**Ancient Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture**
Acupuncture is a very old Chinese medicine that is over 2,000 years old. It comes from a system of medicine that includes herbal medicine, massage, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help people feel better from many different problems, like pain.
**What is Acupuncture?**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that our body has a special energy called Qi. This energy flows through our body along special lines called meridians. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, we can get sick. An acupuncturist tries to find where the flow of Qi is blocked and helps to fix it.
**How Does Acupuncture Work?**
An acupuncturist uses special needles to help the flow of Qi. They might also use heat or pressure on certain points to help the flow of Qi. Some people feel a strange sensation when the needle is inserted, like a tingling or numbness.
**Pain Relief**
Acupuncture can help with many types of pain, like back pain, arthritis, and headaches. Some doctors in the West use acupuncture to help people feel better from pain.
**How Effective is Acupuncture?**
Some studies show that acupuncture can help 50-80% of people feel better from chronic pain. Acupuncturists say that it might take a few visits to feel real relief, but some people feel better after just a few visits.
**A Different Approach**
Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They want to know what is causing the pain and how it affects the person's life. This is different from Western medicine, which often focuses only on the symptoms.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
It's important to choose an acupuncturist who is qualified and trained. Some acupuncturists have traditional training, while others use a more scientific approach. It's a good idea to talk to a doctor before trying acupuncture.
I hope this simplified text helps learners of level A1 understand the basics of acupuncture!"

The Pen is Mightier than the Doctor
Some people think that writing can tell us a lot about a person. This is called graphology. Many countries use graphology to help choose the right person for a job. They look at how someone writes to see if they are good for the job.
Some experts say that graphology can even help us understand if someone is sick or has a mental problem. They can look at how someone writes to see if they have heart disease or cancer. They can also see if someone is stressed or anxious.
One expert, Patricia Marne, has been studying graphology for 20 years. She says that handwriting can tell us a lot about a person. She can tell if someone is smart or not, and if they are good at art or science. She can even tell if someone is honest or not.
Ms. Marne says that graphology can also help us understand if someone might do something bad. She says that most people who do bad things have handwriting that is not very good. She can also tell if someone is going to be violent or if they are under a lot of pressure.
Some doctors and psychiatrists do not agree with Ms. Marne. They think that handwriting is not important and that it does not tell us anything about a person.

'Chewing Gum: A Fun Habit
Many people like to chew gum. In the United States, people chew 12 million sticks of gum every day! Did you know that chewing gum is a food? It has to follow special rules to make sure it's safe to eat.
A long time ago, people chewed a special kind of gum made from the bark of a tree. The ancient Greeks even used it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Later, people in America started chewing gum made from the sap of spruce trees.
Today, most gum is made from a special kind of sap called chicle. It's soft and stretchy, and it comes from a tree in Central America. But it's hard to get this sap, so people have to work hard to get it. They have to climb the trees and carry the sap back to their camp. It's a tough job!
Gum companies are always trying to make new kinds of gum. They want to make gum that tastes good and is good for your teeth. They say that chewing gum can even help prevent cavities! Some people like to chew gum to relax or to get more saliva in their mouth.
Now, you might be wondering how gum is made. It's made from a mixture of things like sugar, water, and special oils. Some flavors are natural, but others are made in a laboratory. And guess what? The United States has a lot of land dedicated to growing the mint that's used in many popular gum flavors!'

We remembered what could have happened if the river had not been controlled by a dam many years ago. The dam helps keep the river safe. When the snow started to melt, we saw big clouds coming.

The water came down the stream, making it very deep and fast. We were lucky that the dam held and the water went back down.

To help people feel more at ease, Jerome has some special techniques. He uses virtual reality headsets to distract patients while he checks their teeth. They can watch a movie or look at a virtual tour of their mouth. Most patients enjoy this part of their visit.
The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Jerome wants patients to feel comfortable and not scared. He takes his work very seriously, but he also wants his patients to feel relaxed.
Jerome went to the United States to learn new dental techniques. He found that when patients are happy, it's easier for the dentist to do their job. He wants to change the way dentists work in the UK, making it more friendly and less formal.'

'Chocolate is a popular food in the world. It comes from a special tree in South America. Many people buy chocolate at Easter, especially in the UK. They spend a lot of money on it. Chocolate has been around for a long time. The Aztecs grew the tree over 3,000 years ago. They used the seeds to make a drink called xocoatl. It was bitter and they used it for special occasions. The Spanish made it sweeter by adding sugar and cinnamon. In the 17th century, people started to drink chocolate in Europe. They called it a 'bitter water'.
In the 19th century, a man in the Netherlands invented a way to make chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate at home. Later, a company in England added milk to the chocolate and created milk chocolate. Today, many companies make chocolate, but some farmers who grow the cacao tree are struggling because the price of the beans is low. So, next time you eat chocolate, remember the farmers who grow the beans.'

Peter says he doesn't decide the prices, but he's happy to sell his work. He thinks he's the only one who makes things like this, and people will want his work when he stops making it. He wishes he had started earlier, but he's still making beautiful things. He uses special glue, cardboard, and washing-up liquid to make his creations.

When she's not teaching, Rachel goes underwater in a special vehicle. It's like a small car. She goes down to the ocean floor to study underwater volcanoes. It's a long way down - three kilometers!
Inside the vehicle, there's not much space. Rachel can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to being in a small space, so they don't get upset. They stay inside until someone opens the door from outside.
The dive can take 16 hours. Rachel spends three hours going down, 10 hours collecting samples, and three hours going back up. If something goes wrong, Rachel can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface.
Rachel has made six dives. She went with a Russian team to study underwater volcanoes. They were near the Canary Islands. The volcanoes were very hot and had black smoke coming out.
When Rachel isn't at sea, she's in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She teaches and does research. She loves her job. She studies ""black smokers"", which are underwater volcanoes that shoot out hot water and black smoke.
Rachel has had some scary moments. Once, there was an explosion while she was underwater. She was worried she would die. But everything was okay. She felt relieved.
Rachel loves going underwater. She feels a sense of wonder when she sees the underwater volcanoes. She's lucky to be able to see them, as no one else has seen them before."

'Lost luggage is a problem at airports. Sometimes, people arrive at the airport and their bags are not there. This can be very frustrating. They might have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds their luggage. This can happen even if you fly with a good airline. The airline might lose your bag because of a mistake or because it gets mixed up with another bag. 
Airports are very busy, and it's hard to keep track of all the bags. There are many flights and many people. Sometimes, bags get lost when people change planes. This can happen even in big airports like Heathrow in London. 
To avoid losing your luggage, it's a good idea to check in early and fly direct if you can. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline and give your bag extra time to get to your destination. Make sure to label your bag with your name and address. If your bag still gets lost, go to the airport official and fill out a special form before you leave.'

**Taking Care of the Countryside**
The National Trust is a group that helps protect the countryside in England. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and met Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust. He told me about his job.
Gareth says that to be a good warden, you need common sense. You also need to be good with people because you work with farmers, visitors, and others. Gareth grew up on a farm and worked there until he got married. He applied for the warden job and got it because of his local knowledge and farming experience.
Gareth still works with his parents on the farm, which helps him understand the problems of farmers. He is also physically fit and can do tasks like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working for the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation.
Gareth used to collect flowers, butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests when he was a child. He realized that farming has affected the countryside. He says that farmers and conservationists used to argue, but now they are working together.
Gareth's job involves conservation, letting people visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and meeting the farmers who rent the land. He enjoys seeing projects finished and meeting the public. But sometimes, he has to deal with people who are not very nice.
Gareth likes his job and thinks it's important to have common sense. If you like the outdoors and want to work in a job like Gareth's, you might consider applying to become a warden. However, it might take a long time to get a job on the Lleyn Peninsula.

' SPECIAL MUSIC SCHOOLS
Some children are very good at music. It's not always easy to know how to help them. Some parents don't even notice their child's talent until they get very upset. Schools usually help children who are good at other subjects, but music schools are special. They help children who are very good at music.
There are five music schools in Britain. They are for children between 7 and 18 years old. The schools have professional musicians to teach them. Children at these schools spend most of their day learning music. They have lessons, play in orchestras, and practice singing. They also do some schoolwork, like English, maths, and science.
The schools are small and have a lot of teachers. Most children who go to these schools live at the school. This means they are with other children who like music. Some people might think it's a problem that these schools are expensive. But the schools try to help families who can't afford it.
Some people might not want their children to go to boarding school, especially when they are very young. The people in charge of the schools think it's better to wait until children are a bit older before sending them to a music school. This is because music schools can be very intense and might cause stress. But the schools look after each child and help them if they need it.
Some people who went to music school think it was very helpful. But some people also think it's a shame that the schools don't teach as much as other schools. Some children who are very good at music are also very good at other things. They might do well in a regular school with a good music department. There are also music colleges that offer lessons on Saturdays. This is a good option for families who live near a big city.'

'Dolphins are very popular animals. Many people love them. They are smart and can understand human emotions. We see them in films and TV shows. But, sadly, their lives are not easy. The ocean is polluted and there is not enough food for them. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that their situation is very bad.
There are many kinds of dolphins. Some live in the open sea and we don't know much about them. Others live near the coast. The grey bottlenose dolphins used to be common near European coasts, but now they are rare. They are stressed and have skin injuries.
The ocean is not healthy because of overfishing. Dolphins need fish to eat, but fishermen catch too many fish. This means dolphins can't find food and might get caught in the fishermen's nets. Sometimes, dolphins get hurt or killed by these nets.
Dolphins can also eat things that are bad for them, like pesticides. These poisons can make them sick and even kill them. Female dolphins can pass these poisons to their babies through their milk.
Another problem is noise pollution. Dolphins use sound to communicate, but the noise from ships and other human activities can disturb them. We don't know how this affects them, but it might be very bad for them.'

""Exercise is good for our body, mind, and spirit. It helps us stay healthy and strong. There are many reasons why we should exercise. It makes our muscles stronger, helps us look better, and keeps us from getting hurt. Exercise also helps us feel better and sleep better. It can even help us with some medical problems.
There are many types of exercise we can do. We can do aerobics, jogging, or work out with weights. But we should start slowly and carefully. It's a good idea to talk to a doctor before we start a new exercise routine.
Good posture is important too. It helps us look and feel better. If we stand up straight, we can feel more confident and strong. We can try to imagine that the top of our head is connected to a balloon, and it's pulling us up towards the sky. This helps us lift our chest and look more confident.
Stretching is also important. It helps us move more easily and prevents injuries. We should stretch four or five times a week to stay flexible and strong.
The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, a good workout, and a cool-down. This helps us stay healthy and strong.""

Amanda and Owen are good friends and work well together. They don't argue much. They like to see animals in the same way. They sleep in tents at night and make tea the night before to drink in the morning. They eat pre-packed meals.
Sometimes they are away for eight weeks. It can be hard, but they like being alone in the wild. They can get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Amanda and Owen have worked together for many years. They want to make films that show the true spirit of the animals and places they visit.

'Meeting the Netball Captain'
Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. I met her and asked her about her training. She told me that she trains every day, usually in a supermarket car park! She doesn't notice people looking at her because she's too focused on her movements and feet.
Kendra's life is all about being ready for the World Championships next month. She has a strict training plan to get fit for the big event. This is her fourth World Championships and she's excited to have home support. She thinks it will be more challenging than usual because people will expect them to do well.
The team is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra says it's hard to play every day with no rest in between games. But she's confident they can still win if they lose the first game.
Netball has changed a lot since Kendra started playing. Players are now faster and more aggressive. As captain, Kendra tries to be a good leader and support her team. She's been planning her netball career carefully and this will be her last big event as a player. After the championships, she might coach young players.
When Kendra leads her team out onto the court, she'll probably be a little emotional. Her fans will be cheering her on every step of the way.

'Rachel Mills is a scientist who works at the bottom of the ocean. She studies the ocean and its chemical processes. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes down to the ocean floor in a special vehicle. This vehicle is like a small car and can go down to 3 kilometers deep. Rachel studies underwater volcanoes. She can stay down there for 16 hours. If something goes wrong, she can press a button and a special escape boat will take her to the surface.
Rachel has made six dives. She went on a trip with a Russian team to study a special place with many underwater volcanoes. They were studying how to make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She teaches to earn money so she can do her research. She loves teaching and learning about underwater volcanoes. She has been studying them for three years.
Rachel has had a few scary moments while diving. Once, there was an explosion and she thought she was going to die. But it was okay and she was relieved. Rachel loves diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. She feels a sense of wonder when she sees the underwater volcanoes. She feels lucky to be the first person to see them.'

**First Impressions are Important**
When we meet someone for the first time, we often form an opinion about them in just a few minutes. We notice how they dress, their eye contact, and how they move their body. We also hear their voice and words.
Mary Pearce, a teacher, had an interview for a job at a school. She was late because she had a small hole in her jacket, but she didn't want to be late. Unfortunately, she didn't get the job. The interviewer said that if someone doesn't take care of their appearance, they might not be a good teacher.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who take care of themselves are more likely to care about their work. He thinks it's important to look good in an interview.
Janet Goodwood, an administrative assistant, didn't get an interview for a promotion because the interviewer didn't think she looked professional enough. She was surprised because she thought her work was good.
Our body language and facial expressions can also affect how others see us. A psychologist found that 55% of what we communicate comes from our facial expressions. We should make sure our words and body language match.
Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, got a job offer on the spot, but she was too excited and the interviewer thought she would accept the job without negotiating the salary.
Finally, it's important to be prepared for an interview and to communicate clearly. David Artesio, a manager, suggests learning about the company before the interview and asking questions. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, suggests speaking in short, clear sentences.

**Four Young Sports Stars**
Four young people talk about their sports. They are Darius (runner), Gabriel (surfer), Dieter (yacht racer), and Tomas (tennis player).
**Darius (runner)**
I like sports. I played many sports when I was young, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to run instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country and got a medal. It was not very famous, though. I train at home in the winter and then go to a special place for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun! But you have to be very focused. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no.
**Gabriel (surfer)**
Surfing is a small sport, so I see the same people everywhere. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are early in the morning. So, if you want to be good, you can't go out late at night. I don't mind that much, but I like sleeping in. But it's worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a big win, I like to have a party and celebrate. And, of course, it's worth it in the long run because I got a TV job after I won.
**Dieter (yacht racer)**
When I'm on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We like to celebrate when we win. Sometimes reporters ask us about where we go out and what we do, but we don't try to get famous. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back and do normal things with my friends. I'm known in the sailing world, but not many people recognize me on the street. I like getting letters from fans and I always reply.
**Tomas (tennis player)**
It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd cheering. But sometimes it gets too crowded. I like being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping, but it can be a problem. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from other fans. Tennis players have to travel a lot, and that's why we split up. But you have to make sacrifices in sports. I'm happy to focus on my game now and do other things later when I retire.

Shopping with children can be very difficult. A mother says, 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff.' She feels guilty when she says no, but she also feels bad when she says yes because she knows it's not good for them. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she worries that she's not letting them make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes when they're shopping with their parents. Companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. This can make it hard for parents to say no to their children's requests.
Some parents feel stressed because they don't know how to say no to their children. They want to make sure their children are healthy, but they also don't want to disappoint them. One mother says, 'I talk to my son about different products and labels. He's learned to be critical of advertisements, and we have few conflicts when we shop now.'
Parents also admit that they're not always consistent. They might say no to their children's requests, but then buy things they shouldn't buy themselves. Supermarkets could make it easier for parents by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This would make shopping more enjoyable for parents and children.

'The Merrion Hotel is a new, five-star hotel in Dublin. It was built in four old houses and took almost two years to finish. The hotel has the latest technology to help staff and guests. The manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests by name. He uses a special computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system helps the staff to give special treatment to returning guests. For example, if a guest likes a certain type of music, the staff will play it for them again on their next visit.
Guests can also control the temperature in their room. They can change it by three degrees either way, and the staff can adjust it even more if needed. The hotel has many modern facilities, including a swimming pool, gym, and restaurants. The food is very good, and the chef has a special restaurant that has two stars from a famous food guide.
The hotel has many new technologies, like video conferencing and DVD players. But the staff have tried to make sure that guests feel comfortable with all the new technology. The hotel has many rooms, all with comfortable beds and nice furniture. The hotel has a garden and a pool, and there are two bars and two restaurants.

'Ice Skating
Ice skating has been around for a very long time. People used animal bones to make skates thousands of years ago. Later, people made skates from iron. In some countries, skating was a special skill for rich people. 
In the past, skating was only for rich people and it was seen as a stylish activity. But in the 1920s, a young girl named Sonja Henie showed that skating could be fun and athletic. Now, skating combines art and sport. 
To start skating, you need to be balanced and in control. You should bend your knees and keep your weight in the middle. It's important to relax while skating. 
To move on the ice, you need to push with one foot and move the other foot a little bit. If you fall, it's okay! Just try to relax and get up slowly. 
To get better at skating, you can start with figure skating and then try other styles like free skating. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn. 
Skating is good for your body. It helps you balance, move well, and relax. It's also good for your heart and lungs. You can combine skating with swimming or jogging for a healthy lifestyle.'

'Big People
Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain. He is 228 cm tall. When he was 14, he said he wanted to join the navy. His teacher asked, ""What do you want to be?"" Chris said, ""The flagpole on a ship!"" The teacher was right. Chris is very tall.
People in Europe are getting taller every year. This is because they are eating better. A long time ago, people didn't eat well. They ate only what they could find. Now, people are eating more and growing taller.
A long time ago, people lived in small groups and ate what they could find. They ate many different foods. Then, people started to grow their own food. This was a big change. Now, most people eat the same three foods: wheat, rice, and maize.
Eating these foods has not been good for people's health. People have been eating too much of these foods and not enough of other foods. This has made people shorter and weaker.
Now, some countries are eating better and growing taller again. In some countries, people are as tall as they were a long time ago. But, there is a problem. Buildings and furniture are not getting bigger. This means that people have to squeeze into small spaces.
Scientists are trying to figure out how tall people can grow. They think that people might grow as tall as 193 cm. But, they also think that the Earth is getting warmer and this might make people smaller again.'

TV tries to get different types of people for different shows. Why would anyone want to watch TV in a studio when you can watch it at home? Some people want to be on TV for a second. Others are curious to see how TV is made. But most people just got tickets from a friend. Few of us have ever been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like.

As I got up, I saw the snake. It had escaped from its tank and was slithering around the floor. The cat, mouse, and kids were all running around, screaming and hissing. I was worried about the snake and the kids. I finally caught the cat and got the mouse out of its mouth. The snake was very long and powerful. I was scared, but I didn't want it to hurt anyone. I sat down on the floor and slowly moved my hands under the snake's body. It relaxed and let me pick it up. I put it near a tree in the garden. The kids were quiet for a moment, and then my son said, ""You're warm and nice, and the shed isn't."" I told the kids to gently push the snake towards the tree.

Some visitors even draw their own pictures on the rocks. Experts are worried that if this continues, the drawings will be gone in 50 years.
Some people think that the best way to save the drawings is to make the whole mountain a 'no-go' area, where people can only visit with a guide. Others think that people should be allowed to visit, but there should be more guards to stop them from damaging the drawings.

Some walls are special because they have different shapes and angles. Climbers can use these walls to train and have fun. A long time ago, a teacher named Don Robinson built a climbing wall in his school. He used special blocks of concrete to make it. Many schools built climbing walls like this. But these walls had some problems. They were only straight up and down, not like the cliffs outside. Climbers got bored with the same old walls.

'Want to be an actor? People often say acting is a risky job. There are more people who want to be actors than there are acting jobs. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy. But it's a personal choice, and only you can make it happen. There's no easy way to get there - no test to pass or guarantee of success. It's about being lucky and good at what you do.
Some people ask me what makes a good actor. I think it's a combination of natural talent and imagination. And it's also about being brave and believing in yourself. Actors often can't explain why they want to act. But the important thing is the moment when an actor performs in front of an audience. This is what drives actors to act.
If you ask successful actors how they did it, they might shrug. They know some things about themselves and acting techniques, but they don't take anything for granted. They know they're only as good as their next job, and their fame might not last. The biggest enemy of an actor is disappointment. Actors don't like talking about their chances of getting a job. They find ways to cope with the stress of auditioning and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, the possibility of rejection is there from the start.'

We would like you to try the buttons in front of some of the working models. They make the models move. When you finish your visit, we would like to hear your thoughts. We are always making new models and need your ideas. If you see a model that is not good, please tell us. We will fix it. We hope you have a good time and come back again soon.

'British newspapers often print pictures that show people's private moments. This is not fair. Celebrities usually don't want their private lives shared with the public. But very few people complain to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The PCC is supposed to help with problems like this. The pictures are not important for the public. They don't help us learn anything new or important. 
A famous actress was recently photographed in her hotel room. She didn't like it, but she didn't complain. The PCC didn't investigate either. This is a problem. The PCC should help people who are treated unfairly by the newspapers. 
Some people think the PCC should take action and tell newspapers not to print these pictures. But there are many problems with this idea. The PCC would have to decide when to investigate and how to do it. Celebrities might not want to complain, and the PCC would have to deal with many cases. It would be very difficult to monitor all the newspapers in the UK. 
Some people might not want to complain because they are afraid of more problems. They might think that if they complain, the newspaper will print a new story about them. This is a big problem. It's hard to find a solution to this problem.'

'You have a job and you want to get a new one. This article is about what to do when you want to move to a new job. We are not talking about people who want a temporary job while they look for a better one. We are talking about people who want to take a step up in their career.
What kind of job should you look for? Think about your long-term goals. Do you want to work in a specific area or move up to a more important job? You should choose a job that is right for you. You should stay in this job for two to three years. This job will help you get your next job.
When you apply for your next job, you will need to talk about this job. You should say how it helped you grow and learn. It's also a good idea to travel and work abroad for a while. When you come back, you can get another job and move up again.
Juliette, a woman who used to work for a law firm, did this. She worked for three lawyers and learned a lot. But there was no chance to move up. So she left and traveled for a year. Now she works for a big company and has a more important job. Her boss helps her learn and gives her new tasks. She is happy with her job and has grown a lot.'

A Jenny I was shy when I left school, but I surprised myself when I did well at my daughter's school. Someone suggested I do a university course. I was nervous, but I got more confident. Now I'm more outgoing.
B Michaela My father got ill, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared, but I learned to believe in myself. When things get tough, I tell myself I've got nothing to lose.
C Lisa People think I'm confident, but I'm actually scared. I've learned to look confident because it's important in TV. I've learned that everyone gets nervous, but we feel better when we talk to someone friendly.
D Barbara I'm confident because I like my work. I've built it up over the years. If you learn from your mistakes, you'll be more confident next time.
E Kim I used to be too scared to speak up in meetings. But I started speaking up, and it helped. When I started speaking in public, I was nervous, but I told myself, ""People do this every day, so I can too."" I also wrote down some things to help me remember.'

I have many more."" Adnan showed Paul many kites at his feet. They were all the same size and made of paper and bamboo. They sat under a tree near the beach and watched the kite festival. Many people were there to fly their kites. The kites went up high like rockets. Paul met many people and got five invitations to visit their homes. He decided to visit Adnan's home. At Adnan's home, Paul had tea and crackers. Adnan said, ""Come back tomorrow and I'll show you how to make a kite."" But Paul couldn't come back. Instead, he went to explore the state. He drove to a river and took a boat to the other side. He saw a sign that said ""Jelawang Jungle"" and decided to go there. The path was steep and slippery, but he found a man with tea who was waiting for him. He decided to stay there for the night. It was dark and noisy, but he was safe. In the morning, he saw a beautiful view of the mountains. It rained in the afternoon. Paul got wet and slid down the hill. He was worried about his car and getting wet. But when he got back, his car was okay. Everyone was friendly and asked him questions. Paul liked Malaysia because of its kind people.

But money is just a piece of paper or metal that is worth something. A long time ago, people didn't have money like we do now. They traded things they had for things they needed. For example, a farmer might trade some corn for honey. This was a deal between two people who wanted something from each other.

Grass is important for animals. They eat it and live in the same area. Grass is special because it grows back quickly. When we cut it or damage it, new leaves grow from the ground, not from the top of the plant. This means many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass grows again. This is good for the animals because they always have food.'

'Tanya Streeter is a world champion free-diver. She can swim deep into the ocean without breathing. In 2003, she made a big record. She went down 120 meters into the ocean and came back up without breathing. Nobody else had ever done that before. She was very careful and had 14 helpers watching her.
Some people think free-diving is too dangerous. But Tanya says safety is the most important thing. She trains very hard. Two-thirds of her training is on land, and the rest is in the pool or in the ocean. She uses a special bike to make her heart strong. She doesn't run because she doesn't want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to get fit.
Tanya travels to different places to train. She does 14 dives in 4 weeks. She needs to rest between dives. When she's not training, she goes to events to show people her sport. She also helps the environment. She used to live on a small island where she loved swimming and exploring rock pools. She says her life now is like her childhood dreams.
Tanya is famous in some countries. She wants people to listen to her when she talks about the environment. She's in her thirties now and plans to keep breaking her records. She started free-diving when she was 25, so she will keep doing it for many years.'"

'CARToons on the Big Screen Cartoon films are very special. You can make them if you can draw. New ideas and computers help make cartoons fun for everyone. A long time ago, people thought cartoons were only for kids. But then some directors had new ideas. They showed that cartoons could be fun for both kids and grown-ups. Not all cartoon films were successful. One film, The Black Cauldron, didn't do well because it was too scary for kids and too silly for grown-ups. The directors learned from this mistake and made more money again.'

'I never expected to be on TV. I was in my first year at university and filming a TV show called The Finnegans. I had only acted in school before, but I loved the book since I was 11. My grandmother said I was like the main character, Polly Finnegan, and I always imagined playing her. I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mom sent me an email saying they were making a TV show based on the book. I had to go for the part. She was surprised, but sent my picture to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. We filmed outside for three weeks. When I got back to university, I got up early to do my homework. I didn't tell my friends, but they found out and thought it was cool. It was an amazing experience. I'm very lucky. After university, I want to be an actress. My grandfather was an opera singer, but I'm not from an acting family. I've tried for other TV parts, but didn't get any. I don't know how I did it all, because I had a social life too. When filming finished, I didn't know what to do. I've been in two college plays. Now my first year at university is over, I'm going to Greece with friends for the summer.'

Some of what I have learned is in this book. I think we have something important to say about how to run a successful business and still be true to ourselves. This book is not like other business books. It's not just about my life either. The message is that to be successful in business, you have to be different. Business can be fun, and it can make people happy. I want the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel happy and excited about their work. I hope this book helps spread these ideas to others.

""Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. Bees collect nectar from flowers to make honey. They fly far to get the nectar. It takes a lot of work to make a little honey. The colour and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are many kinds of honey. Light honey is usually not as sweet as dark honey. A long time ago, people didn't have sugar, so honey was a special food. The ancient Egyptians liked honey a lot and used it as money. Today, people make and eat honey all over the world. Some people think honey helps you feel less tired and do better in sports. Honey is not just for eating. It can help with a sore throat and is used in some creams and shampoos.""

Every year, the city of Albuquerque in the United States has a big festival. Many colorful hot-air balloons come to the city. The festival started 40 years ago to celebrate a local radio station's birthday. Now, over 1,000 balloons from many countries come to the festival.
What to see
At night, the balloons light up their burners at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow'. You need to be there before 5:30 am or after dark to see this. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots. The balloons come in different sizes and shapes, like animals and cartoon characters.
You can also go on a balloon ride over the desert or take a cable car to the top of the nearby mountains. There are many other things to do, like watching balloon races and firework displays.
Important tips
Buy your tickets online to avoid waiting. Wear thin clothes and bring a flashlight for night-time events. Don't forget your camera and suncream. If you're not digital, bring high-speed film for evening and night-time pictures.'

""The best time to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is when children are curious and learning about the world. A violin teacher, Margaret Porter, thinks this is the best age. She likes to teach three- and four-year-olds, but sometimes she makes exceptions for five-year-olds who are very interested. 
Margaret's students have group lessons with about 10-12 children. They meet once a fortnight for an hour. Each child also has a one-on-one lesson with Margaret once a week. Parents must come to the lessons too. It's important for parents to be involved in the learning process.
When they start, children learn to play the violin by ear. They don't try to read music until they've been playing for a few years. There is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret doesn't want to make her students great violinists. She thinks that if a student is very good, they should leave and learn in a different way.""

The band is a bit different now because Tom Wilcott plays the bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer. The first two songs on the CD are fast and fun to dance to. The rest of the CD is more like their old style. These two songs might become very popular because they are very good. The singer, Rob Letchford, does a great job singing. He had to record the songs before he got sick and had to cancel their next tour. But don't worry, the concerts will be rescheduled when he feels better. This CD shows that Moonshine can make many different kinds of music, from slow songs to fast and fun ones. I think they put their best songs at the beginning and the last few songs are not as good. But ""Here again"" is going to be a big hit and make the band very successful.'

Winter driving is not easy. It's hard to know what will happen and accidents can happen quickly. Fog can come suddenly on a hill. Ice can be hidden under snow, and a car can slide on it.

1. Drive slowly and smoothly. Don't make sudden movements. Imagine you have a cup of hot coffee in the car. Drive carefully so you don't spill it.
2. Look ahead and be prepared for what might happen. On icy roads, you need to look further ahead than usual. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. Remember, you might be going faster than you think. 
Always keep control of your car and you will be safe.'

'Canada Geese are big birds with blue and white feathers. In the autumn, they fly to a warmer place because it's too cold in Canada. Last year, Bill Lishman found 16 baby Canada Geese on his farm. Their parents were not there. Bill thought, 'These little birds won't know what to do when autumn comes.' Bill had a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. He took them on short flights all summer. When autumn came, Bill flew to Virginia, 600 miles away from his home. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They didn't come, so Bill went to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks, but couldn't find them. When he got home, the geese were waiting for him. They had found their way home by themselves!'

'ESTHER'S STORY
Esther was 16 when she left school. Her aunt gave her some money for her birthday. Most of her friends went to college, but Esther used the money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and jars and made jam. She sold the jam to her friends for 1 pound each. She soon had double the money her aunt gave her.
Esther's parents didn't want her to make jam. They thought she should study to be a teacher or doctor. But Esther didn't listen. She kept making jam. After a few months, she started selling it at the market. Then she made orange juice. She sold it to a school where one of her friends worked.
After two years, Esther's business was very big. Her parents were happy with her. She made many foods and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She was very busy and had to get help from others.'

He said that 67% of burglaries happen when people forget to close a door or window. He said that burglars like winter afternoons because it is dark and they can't be seen. Many people are not at home at this time because they are still at work. Inspector Saunders said it's a good idea to leave lights on when you go on holiday. This will help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch each other's houses when people are not at home. If they see something strange, they should call the police. Inspector Saunders said we will also teach you how to make your house safe. This help is free.""

People like watching Indian films not just in India, but also in other countries. Last year, Bollywood sold its films to other countries and earned over $500 million.

I'm going to visit your country next month. I'm coming with two friends. We don't know where to stay. Are there any cheap hotels in your town? We want to stay in the city centre. Can you help us?
Carlos,
There are no cheap hotels in the city centre. But I have some good news. My aunt Gloria said you can stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house. Is that okay with you?

'People build buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums for football and concerts. We also have museums to keep special things in. Many people work together on a building. The person who designs the building draws pictures to show what it will look like. The engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, the workers build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a nice roof. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a special roof that looks like a tent made of glass.'

""Hello Indre, I need your help. My grandmother is having a party soon and I don't have anything to wear. I'm too big for my old trousers. Can you come with me to buy some new ones? Maybe we can also find some boots. I don't have a lot of money, but I think it's enough. Do you want to meet me in the morning or the afternoon? Let me know. - Sarika""

'Sending Postcards
People like to send postcards to their friends and family. They often have pictures of nice places like beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are cheap and the pictures are nice. The first postcard was sent a long time ago, in the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures of important things that happened that week, like an accident or a famous person visiting. People liked them because they didn't have pictures in their newspapers then.'

'Dinosaurs Nobody has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died a very long time ago, even before people lived on Earth. We don't know exactly why they all died. Dinosaurs are related to birds. There were many different kinds of dinosaurs. Some were very small, and others were very big. The biggest ones were the biggest animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus was 20 metres long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong and had sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run fast because it had long legs.'

'Bears Bears can be dangerous. Adult bears are very strong and can hurt people. They are good at climbing trees and running fast. But they can't see well. They find food using their noses, like most animals. There are seven kinds of bears. The biggest is the polar bear, which is almost three meters tall. There are two kinds of black bears. One lives in North America and the other in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black. Some are dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. There aren't many pandas in the forest because it's hard to find food.'

'AIR TRAVEL HISTORY In 1783, two brothers built the first balloon to take people up in the air. Later, in 1903, two other brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew in it. This happened in America. Then, in 1918, the post office started sending letters by plane. Airplanes changed a lot over the next few years. Then, in the 1950s, airplanes got faster because they had special engines. In 1976, a special plane called Concorde was built in England and France. It is the fastest plane in the world and can fly very fast - 2500 kilometres per hour! This means that the journey from London to New York is very short - only four hours. Now, many people travel by plane and it's hard to imagine a world without them.'

""The Globe Theatre in London 400 years ago was very different. The building was round and had no roof. If it was raining, people got wet. The queen liked to go to the Globe to watch plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. People would eat, talk to friends, and walk around during the show. Sometimes they even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new one was built in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play or learn about life a long time ago.""

'Dear Jeff, I'm having a good holiday in Australia. When we arrived, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now it's better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are in Sydney. Next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is warm and I like swimming there. The fish are different colours here: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to go home! See you at the end of September. Sue'
