'Charging for rubbish bags: a waste of time? 
In many countries, people throw away a lot of rubbish. The government collects it and takes it to a special place called a landfill. But it's not free. The cost of collecting and getting rid of rubbish is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more the government has to pay. 
To solve this problem, some cities have started charging households for each bag of rubbish they throw away. This is called a ""pay-as-you-throw"" system. The idea is that people will throw away less rubbish and recycle more. 
But a study in the United States found that this system didn't work as well as expected. In one city, people started to throw away more rubbish in each bag, not less. They would even jump on the bags to fit more in. This made the rubbish trucks work harder and cost more to run. 
The study also found that some people started to throw their rubbish away illegally instead of paying to have it collected. 
The only good news was that more people started to recycle. But this might have been because they were already doing it before the new system was introduced. 
So, is charging households for their rubbish a good idea? It's not as simple as it seems. The results of this policy can be complicated and hard to understand. We need to think about other factors, like how much money people have and how much time they have to recycle. 
We can't just blame the ""pay-as-you-throw"" system for not working. We need to think about all the factors that affect how much rubbish we produce.'"

Work and life: a changing landscape
Theodore Zeldin thinks about how our working lives might change. Are we respected and appreciated as we should be? Success in our careers is no longer enough. Many people feel that their jobs are not valued or understood. Even those who are very good at their jobs often feel unhappy and bitter.
Loving your work used to be enough to make you happy. But now, we need to think about what our jobs do to us as people. Do they make us more interesting, more creative, and more able to connect with others? If not, no amount of money or status can make up for it.
Theodore Zeldin wants to find ways to make work more fulfilling. He believes that work should be a way to discover new things about ourselves and others, and to build meaningful relationships. It should not just be a way to make money.
Many people are unhappy in their jobs. Doctors, accountants, and architects often feel stressed and unfulfilled. Even people in high-status jobs can feel trapped and unhappy. This is because work has become too focused on making money, rather than making a difference in people's lives.
Theodore Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He wants to find ways to make work more enjoyable and fulfilling. He believes that this will lead to happier, more fulfilled people.
For example, hotels could be more than just places to sleep. They could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could be given more responsibility and autonomy, and could use their skills to create new services and products.
Theodore Zeldin believes that work is a relationship between people. He thinks that people should be able to design their own jobs and choose their own colleagues and customers. This would require people to be able to communicate effectively across different cultures and backgrounds.
The goal is to create a more intimate and respectful way of communicating, where people feel valued and heard. This would lead to more equal and fulfilling relationships, both in and out of work."

'Broadcasting: How Technology Shapes Society
The word ""broadcasting"" comes from an old word meaning to spread seeds widely. This is not just an agricultural metaphor, but also a symbol of modern optimism. It means spreading ideas and information to many people, and making sure they are all connected. The idea of broadcasting assumes that there is a central place where the seeds are stored, and that this place is suitable for spreading and growing.
So, why did a new technology that sends words and pictures through the airwaves develop in a way that fit this metaphor? Television is related to other two-way communication technologies like the telephone and telegraph, but it was designed to be a centralised medium from the start. This was because it fit with the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some alternative ideas and experiments, but they didn't work out. For example, some people in Britain in the 1930s tried to create a two-way television system, but it was eventually stopped. The main reason was that big businesses and the government wanted to control the technology and make money from it.
Television was also seen as a way to bring people together and create a sense of national identity. In the 1930s, people watched TV in public places, like movie theaters, rather than in their own homes. This was the case in many countries, including the US, Britain, and Germany.
As societies became more modern and people's living standards improved, they began to want more entertainment and cultural experiences in their own homes. This led to the development of domestic television sets, and broadcasting became a way for the government to reach people with important information.
The way broadcasting developed was closely tied to the social and economic changes happening at the time. As people became more mobile and moved away from traditional communities, they needed new ways to connect with each other. Broadcasting was one way to do this, and it became a powerful tool for governments to reach their citizens.
However, some people saw broadcasting as a way to promote democracy and give people equal access to information. This idea played a big role in the development of broadcasting policies between the wars.
Television is changing now, and the term ""broadcasting"" might become outdated. But for now, it remains an important part of how we share information and connect with each other.'

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at the B1 level:
'Sometimes, people feel like they never have enough things, even if they have many possessions. This is because we are often encouraged to buy more things by advertisements. These ads make us feel like we need things we don't really need. Have you ever noticed how many ads you see every day? On TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and even on the internet, we are constantly being told to buy, buy, buy.
Caves are another interesting topic that people have studied for a long time. Scientists have spent years researching caves to learn about their origins, water, and biology. Caves are a small part of the natural world, but they are fascinating and have been studied for a long time. Some people even visit caves for fun.
Weather forecasting has a long history. Before we had computers and satellites, people used to observe the weather using just their senses. Today, we have many tools to help us predict the weather. But even with all these tools, human experience is still important. People's observations can help scientists understand the weather better.'

'Opera and Music
I used to think that opera is mainly a form of theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I learned that music comes first. That's how it should be. I come from a world where the spoken word is important, where the actor's words are key, and where the audience and performers share the same language. In a music performance, there are usually some people who don't understand music very well. They might feel a bit embarrassed or in awe of the musicians' skills. Even a good musician has spent years working hard to achieve their level. Watching a top-class music performance is like watching a sports match - we know the athletes are doing something different from what we do, but we recognize how much better they are.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't always understand the skill of acting and aren't always impressed when an actor delivers a long, difficult speech. They might ask the actor how they learned all those lines.
This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences. They are often the same people. What it means is that audiences and performers meet on more equal terms in theatre than in music.
I think music could learn from theatre about this relationship. I've seen how a different approach can make a big difference. Music is already theatrical, with passion, humor, and grandeur. But the way music is presented, with strict dress codes and a focus on the conductor and soloists, can feel hierarchical. On the other hand, applauding between movements or after a virtuosic piece can be insensitive to the whole work.
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to encourage new audiences and break down barriers. I remember a remarkable event where a community opera was staged in a cathedral and then in the town. It was an amazing experience, with professional musicians and a life-changing impact on the audience.
What I want in music is a bit more risk and radicalism, like theatre can display. This can come from using unusual locations or disrupting normal expectations. Sometimes, this can be startling for both performers and audience.
I hope that music can change its conventions to be more like theatre.'"

'I don't like sand very much. It's always getting in the way and making a mess. It's hard to walk on the beach because it blows in your face and gets everywhere. When you sit down, it sticks to your clothes and is hard to get off. But when you go inside, it seems to disappear. I'm not a fan of sand.
People have always wanted to feel safe and secure in their homes. That's why we have locks and keys. Some people like electronic locks, but many prefer the feeling of turning a physical key. A company that makes locks decided to include a metal key in their new electronic system because people like the feeling of control it gives them.
I was nervous about visiting the modern art museum because I don't always understand modern art. I like some of it, but I'm not sure what it's supposed to mean. The museum tried to help me understand by giving me information about each piece of art. This made it easier for me to appreciate the art.'

Making a film is a process of cutting down and simplifying the original story. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be helpful. When I worked on a script, I realized how much dialogue and description in the novel I could remove while still getting the same message across. This doesn't mean that the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's just that the way we pay attention to a story changes depending on the medium. For example, in a book, we need more details to help us understand the characters and what's happening. In a film, we can use visuals to tell the story, so we don't need as much dialogue.
Watching a film can be an amazing experience. It can transport us to a different world and make us feel like we're part of it. But when the lights come on and the film ends, we snap back to reality. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent watching the film, and we don't take it seriously because we know it's just entertainment.
The film studios are often confusing for newcomers. The Leiper Film Company studios, for example, were a collection of small rooms with no clear layout. It was hard to find your way around, and even employees had trouble navigating the place. Despite the challenges, the studios were where romance and adventure came to life.
Many people dream of making a film. Bookstores are full of books on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. There are even competitions for young filmmakers. For example, Robert Rodriguez made his first film, El Mariachi, with a small budget and a hand-held camera. He became a famous director, and his story is an inspiration to many aspiring filmmakers."

I grew up in a place called West Earlham. The houses there were old and not very nice. In the summer, the air was bad because of a factory nearby. I remember sitting on a windowsill and looking at the houses going away into the distance.
My mother was a strict person. She was always angry and I never knew why. She was very particular about certain things, like not walking in other people's gardens or not touching their flowers. She also liked to listen to the radio and tell me to be quiet.
I have memories of my mother and her friends. They would talk about the Royal Family and complain about the weather. They were a bit gloomy and didn't like to talk about anything important.
Growing up in West Earlham was strict. Until I was five, I just stayed at home and played with toys. Then, when I was five, I started going to school. My mother would send me to school with other children from the street. I remember the summer holidays, when I would see a old man who told me stories about his time in the navy.
My mother didn't like charity events or people who asked for money. She thought politicians were bad and that they only cared about money. She would take me to the museum on Sundays and we would look at paintings. She wasn't very interested in art, but she would make jokes sometimes.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The street was getting darker and the air was thick with a misty rain. I knew this street from my childhood. Our neighbors, the Matzes and Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store were all familiar to me. The houses on this street were different from one another, just like the little gutters on the sidewalk that led rainwater from the roofs to the street.
As I walked, I noticed that the houses got smaller and the yards became smaller too. Over the years, some houses had changed. The wooden porch rails and pillars had been replaced with iron ones in a Southern or Spanish style. Some houses that used to be homes were now stores, and some stores had become homes again.
I visited a friend who lives in a former curtain warehouse. It's a big, open space with exposed brick walls and big doors. But my friend didn't want it to feel empty and bare, so he added some walls to create a more cozy atmosphere. He wanted a separate area for his office and a kitchen where he could cook and meet with clients.
I also read about a writer named Bruce Chatwin who loved to travel and write about his adventures. His book ""In Patagonia"" is very famous and has been translated into many languages. Chatwin's writing is imaginative and exciting, but he sometimes mixed fact and fiction to make his stories more interesting.
On a rainy day, I went for a swim in my pool. The rain was coming down hard, and the water was cool and refreshing. As I swam, I noticed the raindrops exploding on the surface of the water, creating bubbles that popped and disappeared. It was a peaceful and relaxing experience.
I realized that swimming is a way to break free from the usual routine and explore the world in a different way. It's a way to connect with nature and experience the thrill of discovery."

'Charles Darwin thought that people cry without a clear reason. But scientists have found that crying is important for building strong relationships between mothers and their children. Many people believe that children cry when they are helpless. But why do adults still cry? It's not just the sound of crying that matters, but the way it looks. In the past, crying might have helped early human communities come together and trust each other. We also cry to show sympathy for people who are suffering. Sometimes we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. We might cry when watching a sad movie, but this is more likely to happen when we are with others. The importance of crying in social situations is clear, but scientists are still learning more about it.'

The Earth is getting warmer. This is known as global warming. But how much warmer will it get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone knows what global warming is, but not many people know what will happen because of it.
A warmer climate will change the weather all over the world. This will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use natural resources to live, grow food, and build cities. Any changes to these resources are important.
Scientists know that human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air, which is linked to global temperature. These gases are building up and are already affecting the climate. However, scientists are not sure exactly how the world will change.
Some research uses computer programs to predict the effects of global warming. These programs are not perfect and are slow and expensive to use. Despite this, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before.
The predictions suggest that the average global temperature will rise by 1-3.5°C by 2100, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and weather patterns will change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts will become more common.
Climate change will affect the environment and humans. It could change the places where plants and animals live, the types of plants and animals that live there, and the resources we use. This could be good for some places, but bad for others.
For example, in some areas, warmer temperatures have helped increase food production. However, in other areas, changes in climate could make it harder to get water or cause more droughts.
The most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will happen because the ocean expands as it warms up and because ice melts. Many people live in coastal areas, so this could cause big problems. Flooding and displacement of people could happen, and some small island countries might even disappear.

Art and the way we think about it can be confusing. We often focus on the physical objects that are considered art, like paintings or sculptures. But these objects are not just physical things; they are also experiences that happen in our minds and emotions. Because of this, it can be hard to understand what art is really about.
When we look at a piece of art, we often think about its history and the people who created it, rather than what it means to us personally. This can make it hard to appreciate the art in a new way. It's like looking at a mountain and only seeing the peak, without thinking about the earth beneath it.
To understand art, we need to think about the everyday experiences that make us feel something. We need to connect the art to our own lives and emotions. This is not always easy, because we are often taught to separate art from our everyday experiences.
Many people enjoy things that are not considered ""high art,"" like movies, music, or comic strips. They might not even think of them as art, but they still enjoy them. This shows that people have an instinct to enjoy things that are beautiful or exciting, even if they don't think of them as art.
The problem is that many people separate art from their everyday lives, and this makes it hard to understand what art is really about. When we connect art to our everyday experiences, we can appreciate it more deeply."

Advertising in Trouble
The 1990s were a tough time for people who work in advertising. The economy was bad, and many companies were struggling. In the UK, for example, the economy was declining, interest rates were high, and many people lost their jobs. Advertising agencies were hit hard, and many people in the industry lost their jobs or had to work with smaller budgets.
Advertising professionals felt under a lot of pressure. They were expected to come up with creative ideas and campaigns with limited resources. They were also expected to show that their work was effective and worth the money. This was a big challenge, as it was difficult to measure the success of an ad campaign.
The recession also made companies question the value of advertising. They wanted to see clear results and a good return on their investment. This meant that advertising agencies had to work harder to prove their worth.
Some companies wanted better strategies, better targeting, and better creativity from their advertising agencies. They wanted to make sure they got the best people working on their accounts and that they were motivated to produce good work.
Many advertising professionals were faced with the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less. They had to deal with the challenges of the recession, as well as other changes in the industry, such as changes in consumer behavior and new laws and regulations.
The pressure was on to increase the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. It was not easy to find help and advice, as many companies were too busy coping with the situation to share their experiences, and those who were successful were reluctant to reveal their secrets.

Summer is a great time to take a break from home and read some books. Reading can help us feel more at ease in the world. We can relate to the stories in books because there are only a few basic human experiences that everyone has. When we read about someone else's experiences, we can see ourselves in their words. This is especially true when the book was written by someone from a different place or time.
Reading and traveling can help us break out of our daily routines. When we're in a new place, we notice things we never noticed before. This is the same when we read a great book. Our minds become more open, and we start to pay attention to things we never noticed before.

'Music in the Future
Technology is changing the way we live, work, and have fun. Susan Hallam talks about how it's affecting music in Britain. In the past, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, and CDs. At the same time, there were fewer jobs for professional musicians and fewer live music performances. It's likely that we'll continue to have more ways to access music, which is good for many people.
Music is important in our society. We use it for special occasions and for personal enjoyment. In the future, the question is not whether we'll have music, but what kind of music we'll have and whether people will still want to learn to play instruments.
The music industry is a big part of the economy, and music skills are important for many jobs. Research shows that playing an instrument can help children develop important skills, like spatial reasoning and social skills. This is good news for the future of music education.
In the short term, there will still be a demand for instrumental teaching. In the long term, music may become more diverse, with new styles and genres. Technology will also change the way we make and perform music. This could make it easier for people to create music, but it might also mean fewer jobs for musicians who only perform live.
To prepare for the future, music teachers will need to adapt their teaching methods. They will need to find ways to teach people of all ages and abilities. This will require them to be good motivators, communicators, and team workers. The music profession will also need to become more accountable and work together to promote the value of music in our lives.'

Actors often get criticized. Sometimes, they say too much about their work in interviews. They should be like the famous dancer Pavlova, who said, 'If I could explain it, I wouldn't do it.' Instead, they often use boring phrases or talk about their personal lives.
Actor Paul Scofield once wrote that an actor's work is only interesting when they are performing. When they talk about their work, it becomes empty and unimportant. An actor should start each new play as if they know nothing and learn as they go. When the play is over, they are empty until they start the next one.
Adrian Lester's performance in Hamlet is amazing. He plays a young man who is both angry and funny. He uses his body and voice to bring the character to life. The way he moves and speaks makes him seem both strong and vulnerable.
What is acting? Is it just imitating people or is it something more? Who makes the actors' bodies come alive? These are important questions about the theatre.
One director has a special way of working with actors. He calls it 'dropping in.' The actors sit quietly while someone else speaks, then they think about what it means and wait for the impulse to speak. They don't plan what they will say, they just let it happen.
The perfect theatre should make you feel like you are an important part of the performance. The staff should feel the same way. The theatre should be designed to make you feel close to the performers and the action on stage. The auditorium should be the right size for the human body. If it's too big, it feels wrong.
Theatre directors can't please everyone. They can't guess what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and surprising."

Some people are worried about sharing their personal information online. They think it's not a good idea to tell everyone where they are and what they're doing. But some people have been sharing their lives online for a long time. They are called bloggers. They started writing on the internet years ago, before social media was invented.
One of the first bloggers was a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall. He started writing about his life on the internet in 1994. He shared photos and stories about himself and his life. He even shared things that might have been embarrassing for some people. But he thought it was important to be honest and share his life with others.
However, sharing too much online can have consequences. Justin's blog was taken down because someone he loved didn't like him sharing his personal life online. Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, lost her job because she wrote about her boss and colleagues on her blog. This is called the ""online distribution effect"". It's easy to say things online that we wouldn't say in person, but our online life is connected to our real life.
Heather Armstrong learned a valuable lesson. She realized that she didn't have to share everything about her life online. She started writing about her family and new life, and now she is a successful blogger. She has learned to share her life online in a way that is safe and respectful.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B1 level learner of English:
Tiredness is a common problem in modern life. Many people are not getting enough sleep. Research in the USA found that 40 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. Some books and movies have even featured characters who can't sleep.
People need more sleep, but they often cut back on it when they're busy. A sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night. They quickly adjusted to sleeping for 8-9 hours a night, which is a lot more sleep than they were getting before.
A university sleep research laboratory in England has been studying sleep for many years. They have tested the effects of fatigue on sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They even use volunteers, who are paid to take part in the studies.
The researchers use a special car simulator to test how people drive when they're tired. They ask the volunteers to drive for a while, and then they record how they do. They also use special equipment to measure the volunteers' brain activity while they sleep.
There are many things we know about sleep. For example, humans sleep in a cycle, with different stages of sleep. We also know that our brains paralyze our bodies while we sleep, so we don't hurt ourselves. But there are still many things we don't know about sleep.
For example, we don't know exactly why we sleep. Some people think it helps our bodies repair themselves, while others think it helps our brains work better. We do know that women sleep for about an hour longer than men, and that older people need less sleep. But we're not sure why.
Some sleep researchers think that sleep is important for our brains to work properly. They also think that people may have slept differently in the past. A historian found that people in Britain used to sleep in two parts, with a break in the middle of the night. This was a time for people to relax and think about their dreams.
In some parts of the world, people still sleep differently. In some tribes, people sleep for a few hours and then wake up again. This is because they need to be alert to watch out for animals and predators. It seems that people all over the world need more sleep.

I used to drive fast cars, but I don't do that anymore. Now I'm trying to find something else to do. I thought about being a TV commentator, but that didn't work out. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but that didn't work either.

Vancouver is a city in western Canada that has become very popular over the past ten years. Many people from all over the world have moved there. The city has a mild climate, beautiful surroundings, and a safe and clean environment. People also come to Vancouver for its good education and job opportunities.
In the evening, people like to walk around the city and enjoy the atmosphere. You might hear many different languages being spoken as you walk. This is because Vancouver is a multicultural city and people from many countries live there.
The city has changed a lot in recent years. New buildings have been built, and this has made the city more lively. The tourism industry has also grown, which has helped to make the city a popular place to visit.
Vancouver used to be called the 'Terminal City' because it was a place where people would stop before moving on to other places. Although this name is not used as much anymore, Vancouver is still an important gateway to other destinations.
Journalists are not very good at writing letters. This is because they are always trying to write something that will have an impact, but this can make their writing seem forced. Real artists, on the other hand, do not think about how their work will be received. They just create something that is true to themselves.
When a new supermarket opens, it used to be a big event in Britain. Celebrities would come to cut the ribbon. But now, with so many new supermarkets opening all the time, it's not necessary to have a famous person to open it. Last week, a new supermarket called Superbuy opened in a town. The first five people to enter the store got a special prize, and this made some people feel happy and others feel left out.

""Citizen Kane""
When the film Citizen Kane was finally released in 1941, it got a lot of attention, but it didn't do very well at the box office. It wasn't until it was shown on television that people started talking about it again. This film is special because it inspired many people to become film-makers. It's surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film.
Welles said that the film's success was because he didn't know what he was or wasn't allowed to do, so he just did it. He had a great team working with him, including a cameraman, screenwriter, and special effects expert.
When Welles and the screenwriter came up with the idea of making a film about a newspaper owner who was like William Randolph Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect idea for himself as both director and actor. He was very excited and took advantage of the opportunity.

I went to Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. They are my job and my passion. I'm always looking for the perfect shot. One day, I got a chance to take a great picture of a burning oil well. It was a lucky moment, but I believe that you make your own luck. After that, I became a freelancer and started getting paid for my work. But, life is unpredictable and things didn't go as planned. I was in Vienna because I was offered a job to take pictures for a book about four cities in Europe. I had already taken pictures in London, and now it was my turn to do the same in Vienna. The Austrian publisher liked my work, so they asked me to take the pictures instead of the original photographer who quit. I was happy to go, as things weren't going well at home. I stayed at a hotel in the old city and spent my days exploring and taking pictures. The first day, I just rode the tram and got a feel for the city. The weather was cold and grey, but I knew it would be perfect for taking pictures. The next morning, I went out early to take some shots of the city. The snow had fallen overnight, and the main square was empty and beautiful. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to capture it all in one shot. So, I decided to take a partial picture. It was a magical moment, and I felt like I was doing what I was meant to do.

'Art That Moves
The Hayward Gallery in London is now a place of wonder. It's not a big, flashy show, but an interesting look at a type of art that has been around for 60 years. Kinetic art is about movement - artworks that move or explore the idea of movement. The exhibition shows how this type of art has been popular among many artists, but not many people know about it. The curator, Guy Brett, has gathered a lot of paintings, drawings, and films to show how kinetic art has developed over time.
Visitors can look at the artworks without reading too much about them. This way, they can make their own connections and discoveries.
Some people like David Hockney's art because it's easy to understand and looks like something they can relate to. But does that mean his art is not good? Some critics think he's not a great artist, but Hockney doesn't worry about it. He knows that only time will tell if his art is important.
I have seen many art exhibitions recently, and some are very good, while others are not. What bothers me is when exhibitions try to show us something we're not supposed to see. Sometimes it works, but often it's just trying to be clever. So, I decided to do something different. I took over a warehouse with seven artists and created a show where each artist did their own thing. The artworks didn't fit together, but they didn't clash either. It was an interesting contrast.
Some people think that art historians are only interested in theory and not in the art itself. But that's not true. Knowing about art can actually make it more enjoyable. We can appreciate the beauty of art without needing to know all about it, but knowing more can make it even more enjoyable.
Pleasure is a complex thing. We like certain things because of our culture and the values we learn from it. So, while we should enjoy art, we should also try to understand it better.'

Metals
A long time ago, people might have started using metals because they liked the way they looked. Imagine someone sitting by a river, waiting for fish to come close, and finding a shiny yellow stone. It was different from other stones, and it caught their attention. This could be how gold was first discovered.
Copper might have been found by accident too. When people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for more copper and finding ways to get it out of the ground. This is how people learned to work with metals.
St Ives
We walked down a winding street in St Ives, carrying our bags, trying to avoid the strong wind and the waves crashing on the promenade. It was very quiet, and all the shutters on the cottages were closed. We had taken a small train to get there, and the weather was getting worse. I had promised my friend that we would have nice walks and cozy evenings by the fire. But now it didn't seem like such a good idea.
Computer Modelling
The problem with learning about the past is that it's already happened. We can't talk to the people who lived a long time ago or see what they did. Archaeologists find clues, but we can't test our ideas by trying things with people who are alive or dead. We can't go back in time and watch what happened. But maybe we can. With computers, we can create a virtual world with people and animals, and see how they would behave in different situations. We can make rules for them and see how they would react if it rained more or if there were more people.

**Vervet Monkeys**
One day, a dominant male monkey noticed a stranger in a nearby group of trees. The stranger was trying to join their group, but the dominant male didn't want to lose his position. So, he came up with a clever idea. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the dominant male made a loud noise to scare him away. This worked several times. However, the dominant male made a mistake and used the same noise while walking across the open ground. The stranger realized it was a trick and didn't get scared.
**Cats**
In a small English village, people collected data on their cats' hunting habits. They found that 70 cats caught over 1,000 small animals in one year. A professor calculated that if all cats in Britain were like these rural cats, they would catch 100 million small animals every year. However, most cats are urban and don't catch as many animals. The important question is whether the number of animals caught is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds, and trees and buildings provide nesting sites, keeping the bird population high.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to the marsh people. They wake up slowly, groaning and complaining about the long day ahead. They slowly walk to the water, where they spend the day grazing and resting. They are very patient and quiet, except for their low moans.
**Picasso's Painting**
Pablo Picasso painted a picture of a fishmonger's slab with a crab, fish, and scales. The fish look like they're still alive. The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used many overlapping and interlocking shapes. The painting looks calm and peaceful, but there's a sense of tension and violence between the fish and the crab.

'Photography has been used to capture all aspects of human life for over 150 years. During this time, photography has become better at recording time and space, allowing us to see things that are very small or very far away. It has shown us images from all over the world, including the natural world, the solar system, and the problems and challenges of modern life. Photography is a powerful way to express the human experience.
The idea of using images to record events has been around for thousands of years. The earliest images, like cave paintings, were created around 35,000 years ago. These images were important for many reasons, including recording hunting trips, magic, and religious beliefs.
When photography was invented in the 19th century, it was seen as a way to get a true and accurate picture of the world. People thought that photography was like having a machine that could see and record things just like our eyes do. This idea that'seeing is believing' gave photography a special status in society.
Photography has had a big impact on the way we communicate and understand each other. It has been used to share ideas, tell stories, and show the world what is happening. However, photography is not just a simple way of recording events. It can also be used to change the way we think and feel about the world.
For example, photography has played a big role in shaping our understanding of the world and our place in it. It has helped us to see the world in new ways and to understand the challenges we face. Photography has also been used to bring people together and to raise awareness about important issues.'

**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be like walking through a minefield. You need to be careful not to make mistakes. It's hard to give advice on writing poetry, but I think it's important to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination run free. Some people need a quiet and safe place to write, while others can write even in difficult times. Everyone is different, and that's okay.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you don't have time to include too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if they help the story make sense. A good way to do this is to have a character remember something important that happened in the past. This can help move the story forward. Dialogue is also important because it can show two different opinions at the same time.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves. It's not about seeing everything that will happen, but about making good decisions along the way.
**Looking at Writing**
Language is a natural part of being human, but writing is not. We all learn to speak without lessons, but writing is different. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn to read and write.

I'm writing a book about a man I knew, but I'm not sure what to call it. It's not a typical story with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it's just my memories of the time I spent with him. I don't know what happened to him when we weren't together, and I don't want to make things up. I want to write only what I know.
To protect people who are still alive, I've given the people in the story fake names. I've also tried to make sure that no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and maybe he never will be. If he doesn't leave a mark on the world, my book might only be interesting because of its own value.
But maybe the way he lived his life and the kind of person he was will have an impact on others, and people will realize how special he was after he's gone. Then it will be clear who I'm writing about, and those who want to know more about his early life might find something useful in my book.
I didn't keep notes of our conversations, but I have a good memory, and I've written down what I remember. I've also added some things that I didn't hear, but that might make the story more interesting. I've done this to make the book more enjoyable to read.
I'm worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from a different place, because they are shaped by their environment, family, and experiences. You can only really know someone by living with them. I've only written about people from my own country before, and even then, I've only tried to get to know them a little bit. In this book, I'm trying to write about someone I didn't know as well, and that's making me a bit nervous.
I'm trying to be honest and write only what I know, but I'm also trying to make the story interesting. I hope that readers will understand what I've done and will enjoy the book despite its limitations.

POETRY RECITALS
At any time, people living through a period in history might think that the literary scene is confusing. But looking back, we can see that there were many different kinds of poetry and poets. Today, there is a lot of variety in poetry, and it can be confusing. There are many different ways to write and present poetry, and people have different opinions about what poetry should be.
Some poets write poems that are meant to be read on the page, while others write poems that are meant to be performed in front of an audience. This is causing a debate about the role of the poet in society. Some people think that poets should focus on writing for a small group of readers, while others think that poets should try to reach a wider audience.
Despite these differences, poetry recitals have become more popular over the past 20 years. Many small literary groups and schools invite poets to read their work to an audience. Arts festivals also feature poetry readings by well-known authors.
The benefits of poetry recitals are not clear. Some poets who write for a live audience may benefit from performing their work, but others may not. Poets who focus on writing for the page may not be appreciated by an audience that is hearing their work for the first time. It's important to remember that attending a poetry reading is not a substitute for reading poetry on the page. However, it can be a fun and educational experience.
The main reason for poetry recitals is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for a special group of people."

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for learners at the B1 level of the CEFR:
**Oral History**
Some historians use oral evidence to learn about the past. However, this method has its problems. When someone tells their story, it's not just their own experience that comes through. The person asking the questions and the way they ask them can also influence what is said. Even if the questioner doesn't ask any questions, just being there can change the way the person remembers and talks about the past. The historian's own background and way of thinking can also affect the story.
When the historian is not there, the person telling the story may have been influenced by what they've seen or heard from others. They might also remember things differently because of how they feel about their childhood or other events. The feelings and emotions that make the story convincing might not be from the time period being talked about.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: physiology and whole animal. Physiologists look at how the body works, like how nerves and muscles work together. Those who study whole animals look at how they behave in their natural environment and what affects their behavior.
Within this approach, there are two groups: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists study how animals learn in a lab, usually with rats and pigeons. Ethologists study animals in their natural habitats, looking at their natural behavior.
Some people think that studying the body is more important, but it's not enough. We need to understand behavior too. Trying to understand how an animal builds a nest by looking at individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you need to do two things at once. You need to learn about the subject and how it's studied. Social sciences are not just about common sense. Each subject has its own way of studying and understanding people in society.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was about creating beautiful and harmonious buildings. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He didn't mention functionality or purpose, but he did talk about how to design buildings for different uses.
The origins of classical architecture are complex. There were simple houses and huts before the sophisticated buildings we see today. These early buildings contributed to the development of classical architecture, even if they were not considered artistic.

I decided to tell a story to get out of trouble. I stumbled out of the shadows, crying and holding my head. I told my parents that I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and had crawled through it to get out. My father looked at me suspiciously and asked me to tell him again. I hesitated, and he narrowed his eyes. I added that the tunnel had collapsed after me, so it was no use looking for it. The well was also dangerous. I had almost died. I looked at my father, and it was like looking into a dark tunnel with no end. He was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing the world through adult eyes. My words stopped, and he walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad and worried expression, shaking his head. He was sorry for me, but also thought I was a shameless and incompetent liar. His pity was as harsh as my father's words, and it affected me deeply.'

Amazon let people write whatever they wanted about a book and give it 1-5 stars. This meant that readers could see what others thought about a book, good or bad. Other online bookstores did the same.

Authors could also write comments on their own books. Some authors wrote nice messages, while others gave their email addresses so readers could contact them.

Here is the simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at level B1 (CEFR):
Art is often seen as something that must be unique and revolutionary. We admire artists who create something new and different. However, we often forget that art can also be about old ideas, methods, and values. We expect artists to be special and talented, and we get upset if they don't follow the rules.
Imagine a situation where an artist asks someone to write a simple text on a canvas. The text says that there are many different kinds of pictures. The artist then asks someone else to paint the text on the canvas in plain black letters. Is this a painting?
In the art world, it's common for artists to stick to what they are good at. If they try something new, people might not like it. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have been successful by trying new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something new. He is showing his new art at an exhibition called Underground Encounters. It's about the London Underground and the people who use it.
In this text, an artist writes about why they create art. They say that art can help people heal and find meaning in their lives. They believe that art can bring people together and help them understand each other better.
I have simplified the text by:
* Using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary
* Removing complex ideas and concepts
* Focusing on the main ideas and themes
* Using examples and illustrations to help learners understand the text better

At the time, it seemed like a good idea because they were making a lot of money and Lois had just gotten a raise at her job. They needed more space and a garden, so they moved to a bigger house. But Lois wanted to live in a prestigious area, not just anywhere. She thought it was important for her career and social life.
Simon and Lois had to make some sacrifices, like taking public transport to work. Simon had to take the crowded tube every day, which made him feel frustrated. He thought about his childhood and his grandparents' house in Hampstead, where he felt happy and relaxed. His grandmother was a kind and caring person who made sure his grandfather, a lawyer, felt comfortable after a long day.
Lois was important to Simon's career and he knew it. They both worked hard and their standard of living depended on their two salaries. But now, their life was threatened by someone who was trying to destroy Simon's reputation. This person, Venetia, was angry and upset because of something that happened in court. Simon felt guilty and regretful about what happened and wished he had handled the situation differently.

I chose to live in this place because I thought I could be anonymous here. I thought no one would care about the state of the houses or the gardens. But it's not true. People in the shops soon recognize me. Even my neighbor, Jaz, who lives next door, knows me. She's an author and I sometimes help her with her writing. I'm sitting in my garden, enjoying the summer evening, when Jaz comes out to talk to me. She's been working on a new book and is looking for feedback. I try to be kind, but I think her writing is too focused on herself and her problems. I suggest she write about nice people and their good qualities. Jaz is upset and defends her writing. I feel a bit uncomfortable and try to change the subject. Later, I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to say, ""I've had my moments."" It's a strange memory that comes to me.

Heritage is important because it connects us to the past. We often feel connected to our family heritage, but there's also a wider need to learn about our history to understand our individual and national futures. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity and helps us understand who we are. It's like inheriting a culture that has been passed down through generations.
In the past, people learned about their heritage through stories and legends passed down from their ancestors. However, with the break-up of communities and families in Western industrial society, much of this oral tradition has been lost. Today, we can learn about our heritage by visiting places and looking at architectural'memories'.
I chose to write about the Fens, a region in England, because of its unique landscape. The Fens are not just flat and empty, but also richly English and strangely fascinating. Many people find the Fens peculiarly foreign, even though they are in the middle of England.
Museums are important because they make their collections accessible to everyone. They should not just display objects, but also make them easy to understand and use. Museums exist to show us real objects that actually existed in the past, not replicas. They help us connect with the past and understand our heritage.
Preserving things is not new, but the speed and scale of change in our towns today means that many of us are affected. Some people want to preserve everything, while others think about the future of our towns. As planners, it's important to consider the psychological need for preservation and learn how to handle change.

'Einstein is a famous scientist. Most people know his face, but not much about what he did. He came up with some big ideas called'relativity'. These ideas are hard to understand and seem strange. Einstein was part of a big change in the way people thought about science. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better. Einstein looked at the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. He showed that time and space are not fixed, but can change. This was a big change from what people thought before.
In our childhood, my sister and I didn't like reading prize-winning books because we thought they would be boring. Our parents tried to encourage us to read by giving us small rewards for reading certain books. They also gave us books as presents, sometimes with a note that said ""This book is not just for fun"". We didn't like most of the books they gave us, but they did introduce us to some good stories and poems.
The origin of language is a mystery. Many people have tried to explain how it started. Some say that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. These sounds may have been like a cry for help. Some words may have started from these sounds. People used to think that language was just for talking to each other, but now scientists are studying how it developed. They think language started in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. It was important for people to communicate with each other and to show power. It was not just for sharing information, as some people thought.'

Writing Reviews
Frank Kermode thinks about how to write reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and are only published for a short time. They are often limited in length and are only read for a day or a week. People usually think that reviewing is not a important job because it's not as valuable as writing a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled job that requires a lot of knowledge and the ability to write well.
A reviewer needs to consider the audience, whether it's someone who just skims the newspaper or someone who wants to read a more in-depth review. They also need to know a lot about different subjects and be able to write in a way that is easy to understand.
Many writers who review books also write other things. For example, the American novelist John Updike writes reviews in his free time. He collects his reviews and publishes them in books. Some people might think that reviewers should not be allowed to keep their reviews because they are not as important as other writing. However, reviewers should be allowed to keep their work because it's a way for them to share their thoughts and opinions with others.
In some countries, professors and writers often do both academic work and reviewing. This is okay because it helps readers know that the reviewer is knowledgeable about the subject, and it also reminds professors to write in a way that is easy to understand for non-academics. Finally, reviewing is not as important as other types of writing, but it's still a valuable job that requires skill and knowledge.

Ralph opened the door to his flat and felt a familiar mix of emotions. He had bought the place three years ago, and sometimes, when he came home alone at the end of the day, he still felt a little uncertain. When he first moved in, he was excited to come home and explore the place. He would often get home early, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat was like a welcome home to him, a place where he could relax and feel in control. He didn't worry about intruders or problems with the flat, as it was always the same when he left it. Over time, he started to see it as an extension of himself, a space where he could be himself.
When he returned home, he would often find a pile of letters by the door and a blinking answering machine. He was relieved that his windows weren't broken and that nothing was damaged. Ralph looked forward to his few evenings at home each week, away from the office. He would sit alone, surrounded by his things, and feel grateful for the peace and quiet.
But sometimes, he felt empty and alone, even with all his belongings around him. He would wonder who he was doing things for, and what his purpose was. He used to read or listen to music at night, but lately, he had been asking himself why he was doing these things. He felt lost and unsure of himself.
Ralph had always felt like he was following someone else's path, rather than his own. He had tried to make a plan for his future, but it seemed like he was just trying to survive. He had applied for jobs that seemed familiar, and ended up in a role that wasn't quite right for him. He took the job without really thinking about it, and now he was stuck in a routine that wasn't making him happy.

""There are some things that can't be rushed. For example, if you add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it curdles. If you try to hurry a tangled fishing line, it gets even more tangled. Our minds work in different ways too. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can speed up some things, like solving puzzles or doing mental math. But others can't be rushed, and if we try, they will break down.
Our minds have three different ways of working. One is very fast and helps us react quickly in emergency situations. Another is slower and helps us think and reason. This is the kind of intelligence that helps us solve problems and make decisions. The third way is slower still and is more relaxed and playful. This is where we have ideas and think creatively.
We need all three ways of thinking. Sometimes we need to act quickly, while other times we need to think carefully. We also need to take time to relax and let our minds wander. This helps us solve complex problems and make good decisions.
Recently, scientists have discovered that our minds can do many things on their own, without us even realizing it. They can learn patterns, make sense of complex situations, and solve difficult problems. This shows us that our minds are capable of many amazing things, and we should give them the time to work in their own way.""

Birds have always played a big role in human culture. People have loved, feared, and worshipped them. But what does this say about us? 
In the greenhouse, a little brown bird is bouncing against the glass. It's a wren, a bird that people have associated with good luck and prophecy. Is it trying to send us a message or is it just stuck in the greenhouse? 
Wrens have been a part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in would determine their luck. Today, wrens are still a common sight in many British homes. 
Birds have a special place in our imagination and in our hearts. A wood without birds is a sad place. This is because we have a deep connection with birds that goes back to a time when people relied on nature for survival. 
Our relationship with birds is not just cultural; it's also a part of our human nature. We have always been fascinated by birds because they can fly, sing, and are free. This is a reflection of our own identity and our desire for freedom. 
In recent years, birds have become important indicators of environmental change. Many species are in danger of disappearing, and this is a cultural loss as well as an environmental one. 
Birds carry a lot of cultural significance. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are symbols of love, romance, and magic. The loss of these birds is not just a loss of species, but also a loss of cultural heritage. 
Folklore and stories about birds have a special power to evoke feelings and attitudes from our past. They connect us to a deeper history and to the natural world. Whether we watch birds in the wild or in our backyards, there's something about them that we can't fully understand or explain. The stories we tell about birds are a way of interpreting what they're trying to tell us. 
The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past, and the mystery of the natural world."

'Maps: A map is a way to show the relationships between different places and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, such as 'a day's journey' or 'a few hours' walk'. This method was not very accurate, as it didn't show the actual distance between places. Direction was also important, but for most people, the main question was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?' rather than 'What direction do I need to go?'
Early maps didn't always show directions accurately, and sometimes used signs or symbols to indicate important landmarks. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and the place they were made in. To understand old maps, it's important to know the conventions used to make them.
The history of maps is about how people have become more accurate in measuring distance and direction over time. Cartographers have used other sciences, like astronomy and geography, to help them make better maps. They have developed new tools and methods to show more information, such as contour lines to show height and relief.
Today, maps are used by many people, including soldiers, archaeologists, and historians. Cartographers have had to develop new ways to show different types of information, such as climate and land use. This is because people need maps to understand and interpret different phenomena in many fields.
It's important to remember that maps are not always accurate or up-to-date, and we should not take them for granted. Many old maps are still valuable records of the past and can help us learn about the history of human civilization.'

Climate and weather affect the lives of animals and plants. The air around us creates the climate, which can be hot or cold. This affects the types of plants and animals that live in a place.

Cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things.

**Title:** Build Your Own Bamboo Bike
**Text:**
Imagine building your own bike from bamboo. This is now possible at the Bamboo Bike Club in London. Two engineers, James and Ian, have created a special course where you can learn to build your own custom bike frame. The course is fun and includes a weekend of bike-building.
Bamboo is a popular material for bike frames because it's strong, sustainable, and can be used to create unique designs. The Bamboo Bike Club's idea is to make bamboo bikes more accessible to everyone, not just professionals. They offer a competitive price for their courses, which includes a computer-designed custom frame and a fun weekend of bike-building.
On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach you how to select the right bamboo and create strong joints. They also show you how to use special tools and design blueprints. The process can be a bit tricky, but James and Ian are always there to help you.
On the second day, you get to build the lugs, which are the parts that hold the frame together. You'll also learn how to add the finishing touches to your bike, such as wheels, brakes, and a saddle.
The bamboo bike is strong and durable, and can be used for long commutes or leisurely rides. James and Ian claim that their bikes are just as good as metal bikes, and they've even tested them on long rides.
The Bamboo Bike Club's courses are a great way to learn a new skill and have fun while doing it. And the best part? The price is very reasonable, under £500.

A long time ago, they were very important for keeping accurate time. Now, people are using them again because they like the way they connect us to the universe. Sundials are calm and romantic, and they remind us of our place in the world.
Painting China
I remember going to an art exhibition where I saw people painting beautiful designs on china cups. The ladies were very skilled and their hands moved slowly and precisely. I wondered who would have the courage to take a course in china-painting. But when I went to a class, I found that everyone was there to have fun and learn. Even the beginners were creative and enjoyed themselves.'

Keith and Dawne booked a package holiday to Venice, Italy, but something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel in Switzerland, not Italy. They had given their tickets to a woman at the travel agency and had been told to follow the group. But when they arrived at the hotel, they realized they were in the wrong place.
The hotel staff told them that they were booked for 12 nights in the hotel, but Keith and Dawne wanted to go to Venice. They explained that they had booked a package holiday to Venice, but the staff didn't know anything about it.
A woman named Mrs. Franks appeared and explained that there were many different package holidays at different prices. She said that all tickets and labels looked similar, so it was easy to get confused. Keith and Dawne were upset and wanted to go to Venice, but Mrs. Franks said it would be difficult to change their booking now.
Keith and Dawne were disappointed and frustrated. They had been looking forward to their holiday and now it was not what they had planned. They didn't say much to each other, but they both knew that this was not the holiday they had wanted.

Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer, is becoming a model for good management in America. Most people in the UK know who he is, but in the US, he is only recently becoming popular. A newspaper called the Wall Street Journal wrote that Shackleton was an explorer who was not well-known for most of the 20th century. However, Americans are now very interested in him.
Many American managers are using Shackleton as an example of how to be a good leader. They say that he was a determined and resourceful person who always put his team first. He was able to make difficult decisions, like turning back from his journey to the South Pole when he was close to his goal. He did this because he knew it was the best decision for his team.
Shackleton's team was on a ship called the Endurance, which was trapped in ice for nine months. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his team that they would all be safe if they worked together and trusted him. He was a good leader because he thought carefully about what to do, kept his team informed, and asked for their opinions.
Shackleton believed that a good leader needs to be optimistic, physically strong, and patient. He also believed that it's important to be willing to change plans if something is not working. He led by example, always putting his team's needs before his own.
American managers are using Shackleton's story to teach important lessons about leadership and communication. They say that he is a good role model because he was honest, brave, and put his team first."

'The aye-aye, a rare animal in Madagascar, is like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and tongue to find its food, while the aye-aye uses its teeth and a special finger to do so. Scientists have been studying the aye-aye's way of finding insects. They wanted to know how it does it. They tested the aye-aye with logs that had holes in them. Some holes had insects and some didn't. The aye-ayes found the insects easily, even if the holes were hidden. The scientists thought maybe the aye-ayes were using their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects. But they weren't. The aye-ayes can sense the empty spaces in the wood. They tap the wood with their finger and listen for the sound. This is called echo-location. They can also hear the insects moving when they tap the wood. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker, but it is also like an echo-locating bat. It also behaves like a squirrel, as it has teeth that grow continuously and it eats nuts.'

Most people have photos of their grandparents, but few know much about their lives when they were young. We often think about writing down our own stories, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a way to tell the stories of ordinary people. She writes their autobiographies, which are over 20,000 words long and include pictures. She talks to people from her family and realizes how much of the past is disappearing. She says, ""When I started, I didn't take it seriously, but after meeting people who have interesting lives, I realized how much they enjoy sharing their stories.""
Hannah makes sure her subjects feel comfortable talking about their lives. She promises not to publish anything they don't want to share. One man who told his story said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were things that hurt, like my divorce, and the pain was still there."" He did it for his family, but hasn't shown it to his children yet. He wants to wait until he's gone.
Hannah has found that many people are influenced by their childhood experiences and make the same mistakes over and over. She says, ""It's amazing how many people are still affected by what their parents did or said when they were young."" She also finds that people often regret or resent things that were never resolved with their parents.
Hannah doesn't judge her subjects; she just records their stories. She says, ""It's not about making people look good or bad; it's about telling their stories."" She uses the recordings to write the book, rearranging the order and adding her own thoughts. The final product is a professional-looking book that people are willing to pay nearly £3,000 for. Hannah gets about 10 inquiries a week, but many people are put off by the cost.

A. The theatre director
I have been a father for 35 years, and I have loved every minute of it. I've been lucky to have three small children who love the same things as me: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond between us. I'm not perfect, and I've made mistakes, but I've always tried to be available for my children. I believe it's important to be a friend to your children, rather than just a parent.
B. The advertising executive
I became a father at a young age, and it was a big responsibility. But it kept me young and energized. As my children grew up, they introduced me to new things, like music and fashion. This helped me stay connected to the world and was good for my business. I missed some important moments, like school events, but I've made up for it by taking them on holiday to France.
C. The politician
I've been a busy politician, but I've always made time for my children. I make sure they can come with me to meetings and events, so they know what I do. This way, they don't feel left out. I think many politicians are starting to prioritize their children more, and I'm glad I'm not alone.
D. The writer
I became a single father when my children were young, and it was a challenge. I did my best to stay in touch with them, even when we didn't live together. I regret not being more structured and setting clear rules for them. But I was always there for them, and I still worry about them now.
E. The TV presenter
I was ready to have a child, and it's been a great experience. Having a child makes you realize what's important and helps you grow up. It's a big responsibility, but it's also a wonderful feeling. Sometimes it can be challenging, but looking at my daughter's smile makes everything okay.

'Flying in Space without Gravity
Journalist Tom Mumford joined a group of students on a special flight to test their scientific ideas. The plane looked like a normal one, but it was actually a special Boeing KC-135 that could fly in weightless conditions. The 13 students from Europe and America had won a competition to be on this unique flight. They had to come up with creative ideas for experiments to do in space.
The plane took off and climbed steeply into the air. The students felt their stomachs drop as they went up, up, up. Then, the engines stopped and the plane became weightless. The students felt like they were floating in mid-air. They could move around freely, but it was hard to know which way was up or down.
The students did some amazing experiments during the flight. They tested how things move in space, how animals behave in weightlessness, and even how to make special solar sails to help satellites move through space. It was a thrilling experience for everyone on board.
After two hours, the plane landed safely back on the ground. The students felt a bit dizzy, but they were all very happy. One student said, ""This was an incredible experience. I want to be an astronaut even more now.""'

'I had a special experience in my life where I didn't have a summer for nine years. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is their winter, and I loved it. My parents suggested that we buy a small piece of land there, and if we planted trees, we could keep it. The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, as my father was born there. We found a plot of land 20 miles north of Auckland, which was not very good for farming, but great for planting trees. I was very enthusiastic about the idea, as I had worked on farms in Australia before. My brother, sister, and I started planting in 1968, and by 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres. It was a lot of hard work, but I enjoyed it. We planted trees every day, rain or shine. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot. I even wrote a book about it, called Seeing Green. I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and seen the trees grow. It's been very satisfying to see how well they've done. Sometimes I worry about the weather in New Zealand, but overall, it was a great experience.'

'Helping Badgers'
I was surprised when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. Inside, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were very young and cold. Their mother had died, and they were brought to us by builders who accidentally disturbed their home. We took them in and kept them warm. We fed them with a bottle and wiped them clean with a cloth to make them feel comfortable. The cubs were healthy, but one of them, a male, seemed tired and weak. Unfortunately, he died a few days later due to an infection. We were sad, but we continued to care for the other two cubs.
Later, a local farmer brought us another badger cub, also orphaned. We named him Willow II. He was smaller and harder to feed than the other two. He needed more time and effort to learn how to eat solid food. But eventually, all three cubs grew up and started eating on their own. They loved to play and run around, especially at night. As they grew older, they became more independent and started to explore their surroundings.
We built a special home for the badgers, with tunnels and a big enclosure. The cubs loved their new home and spent most of their time playing and exploring. Eventually, they moved into their new home and we would see them occasionally, especially at night. Now, they have their own territory and are happy and healthy.

'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet'
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer. Halley is best known for the comet that bears his name, but he also did important work on navigation. He wanted to measure the difference between the direction shown by a compass and the real direction of north. This difference is called 'declination'.
In the 17th century, sailors used Halley's work to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans. Without this correction, it was impossible to determine their exact location. Halley sailed to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland to make his measurements. He published his findings in a book in 1701.
Now, Dr. Clark wants to follow in Halley's footsteps and make new measurements to update our understanding of the Earth's magnetic field. He will use more advanced instruments and will be accompanied by a team of scientists. The project will also help to refine a mathematical model of the Earth's magnetic field.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley's work while he was working at Halley Station in Antarctica. He thinks that Halley's life was very interesting because he was not only a scientist but also an explorer and a leader. Dr. Clark hopes that his project will help to remember Halley's achievements and to give him the recognition he deserves.

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How did these birds evolve to have such extravagant feathers? The zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are trying to find the answer.
Charles Darwin believed that living things change over time through a process called evolution. He thought that the best-adapted individuals are more likely to survive and have babies. But the peacocks' tails don't seem to help them survive. They are actually a bit of a problem because they make it harder for the birds to move quickly. Darwin thought that the peahens might choose the males with the most beautiful tails just because they like them, rather than because they are useful.
Alfred Russel Wallace, a friend of Darwin's, had a different idea. He thought that the peahens might choose the males with the most beautiful tails because they have some other good qualities that the birds can't see. The peahens might be attracted to the males because they are healthy or strong, for example.
To find the answer, Marion Petrie and her team are studying the peafowl at Whipsnade. They want to know if the peahens really do choose the males with the most beautiful tails, and if those males have any special qualities that help them survive. They have been watching the birds and taking pictures to see which males the peahens prefer. So far, it seems that the peahens like the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. But the team still needs to find out if the males with the most beautiful tails are also the healthiest and strongest.
One scientist, William Hamilton, has a theory that birds with beautiful feathers are often healthier than birds with duller feathers. But the team at Whipsnade hasn't been able to test this theory yet. They are planning to study the babies of the peacocks and see if they grow faster and are healthier if their fathers have beautiful tails.
There is one more idea that is important. A mathematician named R A Fisher thought that a peacock's tail could evolve because of a kind of feedback loop. If a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the others, his sons will inherit his tail and his daughters will like long tails too. This means that over time, the males with the longest tails will get more mates and have more babies, and the females will like longer tails more and more. This could be how the peacocks' tails evolved. It's a strange idea, but it might be true."

'MY DREAM BOAT My boat, ""The Westerman"", combines old and new. It's not like the fancy yachts you see at the boat show in London. They are all modern and high-tech, but my boat is different. It looks like it's from 100 years ago, but it's actually new. I designed it with the help of a professional designer, Nigel Irens. He used old-fashioned methods, like drawing on a napkin and carving a model, to create the design. We made some changes and adjustments until we got it just right.
My boat is perfect for sailing. It's fast and stable, and the cabin is cozy and warm. I like it because it's not too fancy, just like my old boat, Hirta. Hirta was old-fashioned, but it was a great boat. It taught me that you don't need all the latest technology to have a good time sailing.
My new boat has been on many adventures, including crossing the North Atlantic and winning some racing competitions. It's a great boat, and I'm very happy with it. I think it's a good example of how you can combine old and new to create something special.

In the 7 million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't developed many differences. In fact, humans and chimpanzees are very similar genetically. Our biology suggests that our ability to make art is linked to a small number of our genes. This means that our art is a recent development in human history.
Many people think that humans are different from animals because we make art. However, animals also make art. For example, chimpanzees use sticks to eat and to defend themselves. Sea otters use rocks to open shells. Monkeys even have a simple language with different sounds for different things, like ""leopard"" and ""snake"".
If human art is unique, why didn't our ancestors make art for millions of years? The earliest art forms may have been simple carvings or body painting, but these don't survive well. We only have clear evidence of human art from around 35,000 years ago.
Some people think that human art is different because it's not useful, it's made for pleasure, and it's learned, not inherited. However, animals also make art that is not useful, like the songs of birds. And, some animals even make art that is similar to human art, like the paintings of chimpanzees.
In fact, chimpanzees have been known to make art for their own pleasure, just like humans. They even threw a tantrum when their pencil was taken away. Some of their paintings were even sold at an art show in London.
These examples show that the differences between human art and animal activities are not as clear-cut as we might think."

Charles Hurst is a skilled cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. He works in a small workshop in East London. When I visit him, he seems busy and a bit gruff, but this might just be his way of hiding his shy side. The workshop is full of half-finished pieces of furniture and wood in different colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for 10 years and has a good reputation. People come to him because he makes high-quality furniture with simple, clean lines.
It's not easy to find a good cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Many people call themselves furniture-makers, but Hurst is different. He is proud of his work and sets high standards. He is disappointed by some modern furniture that is poorly made. He thinks that many craftsmen are not careful and just want to make a quick profit.
Hurst is self-taught and has always been good at making things. He learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his customers are private individuals who come back to him again and again. He likes working with clients who are specific about what they want and are happy to pay for good quality.
Hurst is honest and can admit when he makes mistakes. He likes working with clients who are exacting and appreciate good craftsmanship. He also respects other craftsmen who are better than him. He is critical of those who try to be artistic and take a long time to make one piece of furniture. He thinks that furniture should be functional and not just a fashion statement.

People who have unusual hobbies or opinions often find others who feel the same way. They join clubs or groups to share their interests.

The book that these experts chose is important to them because it helped them understand and appreciate nature more."

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five big British publishers about how book reviews affect the success of a book. Here's what they said.
Publisher A Reviews are very important for publishers. People often buy books because they read good reviews. Authors are happy when they get good reviews, but publishers are more relaxed if a book gets bad reviews. They think that some negative and positive reviews can actually help sell books.
Publisher B Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to sell books. Book reviewing is better now than it was 40 years ago, but there is still a problem - many paperbacks don't get reviewed. Publishers should stop complaining, though. Reviews are a good way to get a book known.
Publisher C Reviews are essential for publishing. Without them, we wouldn't know what books are good. We publish many books that aren't by famous authors, so we need reviews to help people find them. Good reviews can make a big difference.
Publisher D The relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK is complicated. In the US, a single good review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, it's harder to predict what will sell well. Some books that get bad reviews sell well, while some that get great reviews don't.
Publisher E Of course, everyone wants great reviews. But do they really sell books? I once published a biography that got amazing reviews, but it didn't sell well. People thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does it matter who writes the review? In the past, people listened to certain reviewers. Now, it's more about the reviewer's personality or the way they write.

'WEATHERVANE MAKER
Graham Smith is a skilled craftsman who makes hand-cut weathervanes. He is one of the few people in the country who still do this work. Graham designs each weathervane individually, taking into account the customer's specific needs. This way, he can create a unique and personalized gift.
Many of Graham's customers are women who want to buy a special present for their husbands. They like to choose a design that represents their husband's job or hobby. Graham's designs are not just traditional cockerels, but can be any shape or theme that the customer wants.
Graham started making weathervanes as a hobby, but it soon became his full-time job. He used to work as a precision engineer, but he found that his new job was more creative and exciting. He enjoys the design part of his work and has now created over 100 original designs.
Graham is very particular about his work and always shows his designs to the customer before he starts cutting them out by hand. He also keeps some traditional designs in stock, as they are still very popular. Graham likes that people appreciate the effort he puts into his work and the fact that each weathervane is unique.
Graham's business has become more popular in recent years, especially with people moving to the countryside. He now supplies weathervanes to customers all over the world, including America and Denmark. The price of his weathervanes depends on how complicated the design is. Graham is happy to create a special gift for any occasion.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B1 level reader:
Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, wrote a book called The Horse Whisperer. Before it was even published, it became very popular and earned him a lot of money. He talks about how he wrote the book and how it became a huge success.
At the beginning of the year, Nicholas Evans had a problem. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about money. He had been without a job for two years and was in debt. Instead of getting a new job, he decided to take a risk and go to America to research his first novel. He had always been interested in horses and wanted to learn more about them.
Nicholas spent three months in America, talking to horse owners and learning about horse care. He was inspired by a story a farrier (a person who takes care of horses) told him about a horse that became calm after being talked to by a gypsy. This idea became the basis for his novel.
After returning home, Nicholas wrote the first half of the book. He was worried about money, as the bank manager was getting impatient. He showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent, and he thought it was good. The agent told him that he might get $30,000 for the book.
Nicholas was surprised when his agent told him that a publisher had offered $75,000 for the book. Then, within a week, the book was sold to two publishers for a total of $1.15 million, a record-breaking amount for a first novel. The book became very popular, and soon film studios were fighting to buy the rights to make a movie.
Nicholas decided not to sell the rights to make a movie, preferring to keep control of his work. He has since written another novel and is considering making another film."

Bobby Fischer, a famous chess player, is trying to come back to the game after 20 years. He's 49 years old and out of practice. His old rival, Boris Spassky, is also playing against him. The first game was a great success, but Bobby is not the same player he was 20 years ago. Chess has changed a lot since then. The game is now more competitive and players need to be in good physical and mental shape to win. The game is also longer and more intense, with players often playing without breaks. This makes it harder for older players like Bobby to win. The game has also changed with the help of computers. Players can now access huge amounts of information and prepare for matches more thoroughly. This makes it harder for older players to keep up.
The text is still about Bobby Fischer's comeback and the changes in the chess world, but it has been simplified to make it more accessible to a level B1 learner. I have:
* Reduced the number of complex sentences and used simpler sentence structures
* Removed some technical terms and jargon
* Simplified the vocabulary and phrases
* Removed some of the more abstract ideas and focused on the main points
* Broken up long paragraphs into shorter ones
This should make the text easier for a level B1 learner to understand, while still maintaining the core content and ideas of the original text."

**Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some young British talents who are making a name for themselves in different fields. Here are four examples:
**Nick Grosso**
Nick is a playwright who has written three successful plays. He is now turning one of his plays into a movie. ""It will be a low-budget film, but we don't know exactly how much it will cost,"" he says. Nick is unusual because he had never been to a play or read a play before he wrote his first one. ""I never thought it would be put on stage,"" he says. ""It's set in a car, which might not have been a good idea if I knew how difficult it would be to make it work."" Nick left school at 16, but returned a year later to study at the Young People's Theatre. ""I loved it there,"" he says. ""It was the first time I felt like I was with people who liked the same things as me.""
**Simon Pegg**
Simon is a comedian who has worked hard to get where he is today. He studied drama at university, but realized he didn't want to be a serious actor. ""I was always more interested in comedy,"" he says. Simon has worked with other comedians, including Steve Coogan, and has been touring the country with his comedy shows. ""Comedy is not as hard as people think,"" he says. ""If you have good material and the courage to perform, it's a great feeling to make people laugh.""
**Ciaran McMenamin**
Ciaran is an actor who became famous after starring in a TV series called ""The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star"". He is now in a good position where he can choose which projects he wants to work on. Ciaran started acting at school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre. ""I was using acting as an excuse not to do my homework,"" he says. ""But I realized I was good at it and enjoyed it, so I decided to make a career out of it.""
**Neil Taylor**
Neil is the lead singer of a pop band called Matrix. They have just signed a deal with a record label and are releasing their first single soon. Neil has been working hard to get where he is today. He left school at 16 and has been trying to make it in the music industry ever since. ""I was about to give up when this opportunity came along,"" he says. ""I'm just happy to have the chance to make music and perform.""
**Stephen Richards**
Stephen is a poet and author who has won many awards and honours. He is known for his poetry and has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel will be published soon. Stephen was a big fan of creative writing at school, but became disenchanted with education later on. ""I decided not to go to university, but I realized I should have done something with my writing,"" he says. Stephen has published several books, including a children's book. He is careful about the quality of his work and wants to make sure it is good before he publishes it.

Volunteer Tourism
Four experts discuss the topic of international voluntary work. They say that the actual help that volunteers give to developing countries is not always as big as people think. This is because many volunteers pay a lot of money to go and help, and this money could be used to pay for more people to work in the community. This is especially true for gap year volunteers who don't need special skills or experience.
Some people think that volunteering is mainly about helping others, but others believe that young people are actually doing it to make their own careers better. This is a big question in many studies.
Volunteering can also help people understand each other better and solve problems. It can even lead to more people getting involved in global issues and building friendships across the world.
However, if only people from rich countries volunteer, it might not help people in poor countries much. The volunteers might just be using the experience to improve their own careers.
Volunteering can be good or bad. It can be a way for people from rich countries to help others, but it can also be a way for them to feel good about themselves. At its best, volunteering can bring benefits to both the volunteers and the communities they help. It can also help people understand the problems that poor countries face and make a long-term commitment to solving them.
Some people think that volunteering is a way to make a difference, but it's not always a solution to big problems. It can be a way to avoid working with governments and big companies, but it can also avoid talking about the big issues that cause poverty and inequality.

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. They also need something to help them get out of bed. That's where clock radios come in. But how do you choose a good one? Our team tested five different models. We found that one model had a ""dual alarm function"" that didn't work as expected. It was supposed to wake you up at different times on weekdays and weekends, but it didn't. This model was more expensive than another one we tested, but it had a cassette player, which was a bonus. You could fall asleep listening to your favorite music and wake up to a quiet morning.
We all liked the radio quality on this model, but it was a bit big. Paul Bridges said he wanted a clock radio that would fit on his bedside table with his keys, wallet, and phone. He also liked the idea of a digital display with easy-to-read numbers. The snooze button was long and easy to press, even with your eyes closed.
This model had a special feature that kept working even if the power went out. We all liked that. However, setting it up was a bit tricky. Tom Granger said it was ""unbelievably tacky"" because of the built-in lamp. He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work. The lamp was also hard to position, so it wasn't very useful.
Paul Bridges liked the idea of the lamp, but he found the radio hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and annoying, but it worked well. This model was popular, especially with young people who liked its bright colors and fun design.
Another model was very simple and cheap. Tom Granger liked it because it was easy to set up and took up little space. It had old-fashioned dial tuning, which he preferred. The radio quality was good, but the tuning was a bit rough. Paul Bridges thought the buzzer was loud and annoying, but it worked well.

'Hedgehogs are small mammals covered in sharp spines. They live in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a ball when they feel threatened, so their spines stick out. This helps protect them from predators. Some hedgehogs in the desert have fewer spines because they need to be able to move easily. They try to run away if they can, and roll into a ball as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep a lot during the day. They often sleep in bushes or holes in the ground. Some hedgehogs can sleep through the winter, but not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs stay awake all year round.'

""Great Women Athletes
It's not easy to be a successful athlete, but women have to work even harder. They have to train and compete a lot, which means they don't have much time for a normal life. But many women are achieving their goals and breaking records. Here are some examples of amazing British women athletes.
A. Jill, a 27-year-old skier, says: ""It's a great feeling to ski fast and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don't feel well or it's windy and I can't see. But I just get on with it. It's not easy to have a job outside of skiing because we train for most of the year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and friends. But it was my choice.""
B. Caroline, a 22-year-old cyclist, says: ""I started cycling two years ago and won a charity race. I was surprised because I had never cycled before! I'm well paid as a professional cyclist and I think there are good opportunities for endorsements. But I worry that people might think I'm successful because I'm good-looking, not because I'm a good cyclist. So I focus on my cycling now.""
C. Annabel, a 26-year-old rower, says: ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because few schools offer it. So many girls start later and it's harder to be successful at an international level. But I love being fit and there's a good social life in rowing.""
D. Ffyona, a 24-year-old long distance walker, says: ""I've always loved walking long distances. I walked across Australia and it was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I got the record! Men think women are more likely to fail, so it's harder for them to sponsor us.""
E. Lisa, a 26-year-old saloon car racer, says: ""Some men are very competitive and aggressive when they're driving. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages, but I love the challenge of racing and trying to be perfect.""
F. Alison, a 28-year-old triathlete, says: ""I train a lot and have to make time for it. I get up early three mornings a week to swim and then cycle or run in the evening. It's hard work, but I feel happy and healthy when I'm fit.""

I found a job painting boats on the waterfront in Cannes. One day, while I was eating my lunch, I saw Picasso sitting at a table with his wife and friends. I was surprised because he was known to be a private person who didn't like to be seen in public. I was too shy to go up to him, but my friend encouraged me to introduce myself. I showed him my sketchbook and he signed it. Then, he drew a few lines on the page, which looked like a cloud or the sea. I was thrilled and started talking to him. He didn't speak much English, so an American woman helped us communicate. She kept calling him the Maestro, and I told him about my love of art and my admiration for his work. After a while, I went back to my boat, but my friend told me to go back and draw his portrait. I was nervous, but I returned and asked Picasso if I could draw him. He agreed, and he even acted out different faces for me to draw. He was very playful and made it hard for me to draw him. But I didn't give up, and eventually he relaxed and let me draw him properly. I was amazed by how young and energetic he looked, despite being 84 years old. He was very kind and generous, and I was grateful for the experience. In the end, he even drew a portrait of me, which was much better than mine. I was lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention, which meant a lot to me.'"

**Talking shop: How shops make us spend money**
Do you ever go to a store and buy more things than you planned to? Shops use special tricks to make us spend our money. Here are some of them:
**A. Fresh and clean**
Supermarkets put fresh fruit and vegetables at the entrance to make us feel good about buying them. They also make sure the store smells nice, like freshly baked bread. This makes us want to buy more.
**B. Where things are placed**
Shops put the things they want us to buy in easy-to-reach places. They also put the most expensive things in the middle of the store, so we have to walk past them.
**C. Tempting us to buy more**
Shops put cheap things, like bread and sugar, in different parts of the store. This makes us have to walk past other things we might want to buy.
**D. Making things look special**
Some shops make their products look special by displaying them in a certain way. This makes us think they are more valuable than they really are.
**E. The total bill**
Shops want us to buy a lot of things, so they put cheap and expensive things together. This way, we might buy more things than we planned.
**F. The price**
Shops care about the price of their products. They want us to think that something is a good deal if it's a little cheaper than something else.
**G. Lighting**
Shops use special lighting to make things look good. This helps us see what we are buying.
**H. Walking through the store**
Shops make it easy for us to walk through the store by using different carpets. This makes us want to explore and find more things to buy.
**I. In-store promotions**
Shops use big pictures and videos to make us want to buy things. They also use special screens to show us ads as we shop.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. People have been eating them since ancient times. In the past, people would plant apple seeds and take care of them. They would also dry and store apples for the winter.
In the Middle Ages, people in Europe learned how to grow apples from the Romans. They grew many different kinds of apples, including the famous 'Decio' apple. But most of these apples didn't grow well in Britain, so people started growing new kinds of apples.
In the 17th century, apples became very popular in Britain. People started growing them in their own gardens and orchards. Some apples were taken to other countries, like North America, Australia, and South Africa, by people who settled there.
In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer in Iowa discovered a new kind of apple. He named it 'Delicious' and it became very popular. Another famous apple was discovered in Australia by a woman named Maria Anne Smith. She was a midwife and took care of an apple tree that grew from a discarded apple core. The apples from this tree were green and became famous all over the world.
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples are grown for commercial purposes and are chosen for their red skin or because they travel well. But many people are starting to demand more variety in apples. We need to make sure that we protect the diversity of apples and other foods.

Richard Nerurkar, a famous long-distance runner from Britain, visited a training camp in Kenya. Kenya is a country near the equator. The camp is 10 miles south of Nairobi, the capital city. The camp is at a high altitude, which means it's very high up in the mountains. Richard had been training in Kenya for three years, but this was the first time he trained with Kenyan runners.
Richard was invited to the camp by the Kenyan national team coach. He had finished fifth in a big running competition in the past, and the coach wanted him to join the team. Richard was excited to train with the Kenyans and to run in a race in Kenya.
The Kenyans are very good at running because they train at high altitude. This helps their bodies make more red blood cells, which carry oxygen to their muscles. Many Kenyan runners have been successful because of this.
Richard's first race in Kenya was a big deal. It was the first international cross-country race to be held in Africa. There were many Kenyan runners, and Richard finished behind them. However, he didn't feel like he had a bad race.
Richard noticed that the Kenyans don't just train at high altitude. They also have a simple way of living. They eat simple food, like ugali and stew, and they love to run. Richard stayed with the Kenyan team at their training camp for a while. The camp is at a high altitude, surrounded by beautiful fields and forests. The athletes live in simple dormitories and have a simple daily routine.
The daily routine includes three runs: a morning run, interval training, and a steady run in the afternoon. The athletes also have time to rest and relax. They take a shower in the nearby streams and eat simple meals. Richard was impressed by the Kenyans' way of living and training. He thinks that their simplicity and passion for running are the reasons behind their success.

Advertising is not as effective as it used to be. This is not just because of the economic recession. The problem is that advertising has not kept up with the way people's buying habits have changed. In the past, advertisers thought about big groups of people, but now there are many smaller groups. Advertisers rarely target the right people with their messages.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you buy many different things, but most of them are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. This is very different from the thousands of brands that are advertised.
In fact, most people do not buy many of the brands they see advertised. They might see an ad for a product, but they don't buy it. This means that most advertising is wasted. The truth is that nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised.
However, some advertising is still effective. It is a cheap way to reach a lot of people. But to make it more effective, advertisers need to target their messages more closely to the people who will be interested.

'Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits a very environmentally-friendly house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This town has many surprises. One is a beautiful old cathedral, Southwell Minster, which has carvings of 'green men' from the 13th century. Another surprise is a special house, designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and they recycle their waste water to make compost for their garden. They also heat their house using the heat from their appliances and their own body heat, as well as that of their three children and two cats.
The house looks like a traditional house with a clay roof, and it blends in with the old buildings in the area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet inside because the house is very well-insulated. The windows are triple-glazed and filled with a special gas called krypton, which keeps the noise out.
When you enter the house, you have to take off your shoes because Robert likes it that way. The house is very quiet and peaceful. It's a sunny day, but the windows are closed and the conservatory is warming the air before it ventilates the house. Robert explains that they need to create a draft because they want to make sure the air is fresh.
The Vales are very serious about the environment. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s. They designed a house that doesn't produce any carbon dioxide. They also designed a system to collect rainwater and use it for washing and drinking. They don't have a dishwasher because they don't like using strong detergents.
The Vales don't pay any water bills, and their electricity bill is very low. They will soon install solar panels to generate electricity and heat water. They even plan to charge an electric car one day.
It's warm in the house, even in winter. Robert says it's because there are no draughts and no heat loss. He claims that people who live in old houses should just wear more clothes to stay warm, like people did in the past. The house is simple and low-tech, and almost nothing can go wrong. It's an affordable house, and it's a good example of how we can live more sustainably.'"

They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them in the garden. The pictures are very nice, but the trick shows that photography is not always truthful.

Blacksmiths have always been important people in history. They made things like weapons, armor, and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers. They also created beautiful ironwork for famous buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. 
However, by the 1960s, there were very few blacksmiths left in Britain because machines replaced them in industry. But recently, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and interior design. This has led to a new generation of blacksmiths who are creating beautiful and unique ironwork.
A group called the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is promoting the craft of blacksmithing. They are holding an exhibition of ironwork at a gallery in Surrey. The exhibition features over 250 pieces, including bookends, a spiral staircase, and other decorative items. The money raised from the sale of these items will go to the individual blacksmiths and also to promote good ironwork.
The blacksmiths are very creative and enjoy working with iron. They like the way it can be shaped and molded when it's hot, but becomes hard and rigid when it cools down. Some blacksmiths are inspired by historical designs, while others create their own unique styles.
Iron has been used in decoration for a long time and will probably continue to be used for many years to come. It's a popular choice because it's strong, durable, and can be made into many different shapes and designs.

I couldn't explain why I was able to stop smoking after just one session. I had attended a stop-smoking group therapy session and it was a mix of talking and hypnosis. I didn't want to stop smoking and I didn't think it was necessary. I had low blood pressure and a healthy family, and I didn't get sick often. I went to the session to write an article about people who were trying to stop smoking, not because I wanted to stop myself. I told the counselor I wouldn't be trying to stop, as it wouldn't be fair. But during the session, I started to think about the idea of not smoking and it seemed appealing. I enjoyed smoking, but the idea of being in control and not smoking made me feel powerful. It was easy to stop, and the physical craving for cigarettes went away quickly. I didn't have any problems with my work, but I did find it hard to do nothing at home on weekends. I think I smoked because it filled a boring moment, and now I have to find something else to do. I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. I have to get used to new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane, without smoking.'

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won the Nobel Prize. You would think that everyone in Britain would know about her, but many people don't. I have been asking my friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them don't know who she is. This is surprising, because she is the only British woman to have won the Nobel Prize in science.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a very special person. She was a scientist, a wife, and a mother. She worked on important scientific projects, such as discovering the structure of penicillin and insulin. She was very good at her job and won many awards, including the Nobel Prize.
But why don't people know about her? One reason is that scientists are not often written about in biographies. People think that scientists' lives are not interesting, but this is not true. Scientists, like everyone else, have personal lives and experiences that are worth sharing.
In recent years, there has been a change in the way scientists are written about. More biographies are being written that show scientists as people, not just as experts in their field. These biographies can help people understand science better and appreciate the people who do it.
Dorothy Hodgkin's life is a good example of this. She was a dedicated scientist, but she also had a family and personal relationships. Her life is interesting because it shows how she balanced her work and personal life. We can all learn from her example.
The problem is that many people don't understand science well enough to appreciate the work of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. But this is not because science is difficult to understand. It's just that people need to make an effort to learn about it.
It's sad that many people don't know about Dorothy Hodgkin, but it's not too late to learn about her. We can all learn from her example and appreciate the important work that scientists do."

Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers come to her when their wells dry up. She and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use machines to drill wells, but Margaret uses her special skill to find the water. She can find water more than 90% of the time.
Margaret's skill is called dowsing. There are different theories about how it works. Some people think it's because everything on Earth vibrates, and dowsers can sense these vibrations. Others think it's because dowsers have a special connection to the Earth.
Margaret's customers are mostly farmers who need water for their farms. She tries to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She looks for areas where the water is safe and can be brought up without harming the environment.
To find water, Margaret uses a pendulum and a map. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. When it swings, it means there is water below. Then she walks over the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above the water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill.
Margaret's husband also dowses, and they usually agree on the spot to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they do. Margaret says her skill is an ""intuitive perception of the environment"". It's hard to explain, but it helps her find water accurately.

'Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player. He didn't grow up in a musical family. His parents didn't play music, but his father gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present when Hakan was just 8 years old. The trumpet was not a toy, but a real instrument. Hakan loved playing it and never stopped. His mother found a trumpet teacher, Bo Nilsson, who was a good musician. Bo Nilsson taught Hakan and helped him to become a great trumpet player.
Hakan says that the trumpet is a simple instrument, but it's difficult to make it sound perfect. He thinks that you have to accept its imperfections and make friends with them. From a young age, Hakan's trumpet playing was special. He was already playing well when he was a boy. He didn't want to play in an orchestra, but rather as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpet player Maurice Andre and wanted to be like him.
Hakan studied in Paris with a famous trumpet teacher, Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was like digging in a garden. Hakan entered a trumpet competition at the age of 17 and surprised everyone by getting to the final. Although he didn't win first prize, he enjoyed the experience and realized that people listened to him play. Hakan thinks that his gift of communication is special, but he doesn't know exactly what it is. He believes that the power of music is that it can move people.'

**Leadership is Important**
To be a good leader, you need to inspire others and show them the way forward. It's not about being tall or smart. A good leader is someone who makes things happen with the help of others. They must be enthusiastic and able to speak clearly and confidently.
According to some experts, most people have the potential to be leaders, but they need to recognize and develop their skills. We are all born with leadership qualities, but we need the right circumstances to bring them out.
**What Makes a Good Leader?**
A good leader is someone who motivates and supports their team. They set goals and achieve them. A bad leader makes people feel unimportant and keeps them in the dark. They blame others when things go wrong.
**Leaders and Managers**
Leaders and managers are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own way. A good leader can transform a company or team, while a good manager can keep things running smoothly but not make any real changes.
**How to Become a Better Leader**
If you want to be a better leader, you need to:
* Find your passions and convictions and act on them
* Recognize your leadership abilities and use them
* Be willing to take risks and learn from mistakes
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but also know when to step back and let others take the lead

I'm 34 and I've decided to leave my job and travel around South East Asia for a year. I've been thinking about why I'm doing this and why others my age are making the same choice. I used to travel after university, but I got stuck in a routine - a job, a flat, and a salary. I felt like I was sacrificing my own happiness for my job. When I quit, it felt like I was taking control of my life again.
I'm a bit nervous because I have to sort out my flat and make arrangements for someone to live there. I also need to decide where to go and how to organize my trip. I'm a bit of a procrastinator, so I've been putting it off. I'm also worried about leaving my friends and family behind and starting a new life on my own.
Lots of people my age are taking time off to travel. They might be doing it for different reasons, but they all seem to have one thing in common - they're looking for a change. Some people think it's because we're not used to settling down and committing to one job or one place. Others think it's because we're more aware of the world and the opportunities it offers.
For some, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. For others, it's a way to reassess their lives and figure out what they really want. I'm not sure what I'll find on my trip, but I'm excited to find out.

""The end of print newspapers may not come as quickly as we think. Some people find change scary, but transition means moving from one place to another. Newspapers are going through a big change, moving from print to online. But this change is not easy. Newspaper sales are falling, but people are visiting their websites more and more. The numbers are not the same everywhere. In some places, newspaper sales are going down, but in others, they are staying the same or even growing.
Newspaper sales are not the only thing changing. Book sales are also changing. More people are buying e-books, but they are still buying physical books too. It's not one or the other, it's both. Some people think that young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but the numbers show that this is not true. Many young people still read newspapers.
Different countries have different stories to tell. In some countries, newspaper sales are falling more quickly than in others. In the UK, newspaper sales have fallen by 10.8%, but in Germany, they have only fallen by 7%. In France, they have fallen by 3.1%.
Newspaper companies are trying to find new ways to make money. They are building walls around their websites to charge people to read their articles. But they are also finding that offering a package deal - print and online access - is the best way to attract readers. Print newspapers still make more money from advertising than online newspapers. However, keeping both a print and online newspaper is expensive and complicated. Newspaper brands still have a strong reputation in print, but it's harder to get noticed online.""

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. Adding a person to a picture makes it more interesting than taking a picture without one. However, photographing people can be challenging. The photographer needs to consider not only technical and artistic aspects but also the person's actions, gestures, and expressions.
**Tips for Taking Good Pictures of People**
A. **Group Shots**
* Don't take pictures of groups in straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances.
* If possible, have some people sit or kneel at the front so everyone's faces are visible.
B. **Posing**
* People often act unnatural in front of the camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. Suggest they fold their arms or put their hands in their pockets.
C. **The Right Approach**
* Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can cause tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to be photographed and are flattered by it. However, they may become self-conscious, so you may need to direct them.
D. **Eye Contact**
* A picture becomes more interesting if the person looks directly at the camera. Ask the subject to look into the lens, not just smile. This will create a natural expression.
E. **Candid Concentration**
* Instead of direct eye contact, ask the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can be easier and more natural. The viewer can follow their attention to another part of the picture.
F. **Expressions and Gestures**
* Facial expressions and gestures tell us more about the person than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiles, winks, anger, tears, and thumbs-up.
G. **Situational Interest**
* Shots that isolate a figure or face can be powerful. The background or environment can add extra interest and information about the subject. Try to exclude irrelevant details or blur them by focusing selectively.
H. **Interaction**
* Pictures of people interacting with each other, like talking, arguing, or working together, can be interesting. Look for contact between subjects, like eye contact or physical touch.
I. **People and Places**
* When taking pictures of people in a new place, use a standard or wide-angle lens to show the background. Ask the subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so the group forms a foreground interest without obscuring the background.
J. **To Pose or Not to Pose?**
* Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone, ask them to pose against a well-chosen background. For family pictures, candid shots are often more lively and memorable.

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**
The way we work is changing. We are no longer judged just by how smart we are or how well we know our job. Now, we are also judged on how well we get along with others and how well we handle our emotions.
In the past, it was important to do well in school and have good grades. But now, it's more important to have good social skills and personal qualities, like being able to work well with others, being flexible, and being able to convince others of your ideas.
This is because many jobs are changing and becoming more team-based. People who can work well with others and handle their emotions are more likely to be successful. These skills are important for any job, no matter what field you work in.
Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control your own emotions and the emotions of others. It's not just about being nice to people, but also about being able to have tough conversations and make difficult decisions.
Many companies are now recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence and are teaching their employees these skills. This is especially important in jobs that require a lot of teamwork and communication.
The good news is that emotional intelligence can be developed over time. As we grow older and gain more experience, we can become better at handling our emotions and working with others. This is an important skill to have, especially in today's job market where job security is not always guaranteed.
Emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success, but it is an important part of being successful in any job."

Ancient Chinese medicine in the West?
Acupuncture is an old treatment that comes from traditional Chinese medicine. It's used to help people feel better from many different health problems. Doctors in the West are interested in how it can help with pain.
What is acupuncture?
Traditional Chinese medicine thinks that our bodies have a special energy called Qi. This energy flows through our bodies along special lines called meridians. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, we can feel sick or weak. An acupuncturist tries to find where the Qi is blocked and helps to get it flowing again.
How does it work?
An acupuncturist uses special needles to help the Qi flow. They might also use heat or pressure to help the Qi move. People often feel a strange but not painful sensation when the needle is inserted.
What kind of pain can it help with?
Acupuncture can help with many kinds of chronic pain, such as back pain, arthritis, and headaches. It can also help with pain after surgery.
How does it work scientifically?
Some doctors think that acupuncture can help by blocking pain signals to the brain or releasing natural pain-relieving substances in the body.
Modern use of acupuncture
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years. Recently, it's been used instead of anesthesia during surgery. This has helped some doctors outside of China to understand that acupuncture can be a useful treatment.
Is it always effective?
Not everyone finds acupuncture helpful, but many people do. Acupuncturists say that it usually takes a few visits to start feeling better.
How is it different from Western medicine?
Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They try to find the underlying causes of the pain and use a holistic approach to treat it.
What kind of acupuncturist should I see?
It's important to find a qualified acupuncturist who can work with your doctor if needed.

Some people think that handwriting can tell us a lot about a person's character. In some countries, employers ask for a sample of your handwriting when you apply for a job. This is because handwriting can give clues about a person's personality, health, and even their potential for certain jobs.
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a science that is widely accepted in many countries. Researchers say it can be useful in identifying certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and in understanding a person's emotional state. Many big companies use graphologists to analyze the handwriting of job applicants.
Some experts, like Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist, believe that handwriting can reveal a lot about a person. She says that handwriting can show a person's social class, intelligence, and even their mental ability. She also claims that handwriting can be used to assess whether a person is honest, manipulative, or a reliable employee.
According to Patricia Marne, graphology can also be used to identify potential criminals. She says that criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which can indicate a lack of emotional development. She also claims that graphology can predict whether a person is likely to commit suicide or have heart or lung problems.
Patricia Marne believes that handwriting can also reveal other psychological characteristics. For example, people who write in a certain way may be devious or clever, while those who write mainly in capital letters may be trying to hide their true selves. She says that it takes six years of study and experience to become a good graphologist, and that more research is needed to make graphology a more scientific field.
However, some doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the value of graphology. They say that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught, and that it has no other significance.

""Is your office a happy and healthy place to work? A new survey says that fresh air and good chairs are important. We visited four different offices to see how happy and healthy they are. We had a team of experts: a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here's what they thought:
Office A: This office is simple, with no central heating or air conditioning. The windows open directly onto the street. But the people who work here are happy and don't complain. They make their own adjustments to keep the office comfortable. This might be the key: the team is small and works together, without too much bureaucracy.
Office B: This office is comfortable, but not very exciting. The air is good, and the staff don't smoke. The chairs are good, and the space is well-organized. However, the office feels impersonal and uninteresting.
Office C: This office is a bit mixed. It's like being in a showcase, with lots of people working together. The air is good, even near the smokers. The desks are okay, but the chairs are not very good. The staff are friendly and supportive, and there's a lot of activity.
Office D: This office is not very good. The air is hot or cold, and the space is cluttered. The chairs are old and uncomfortable, and there's a lot of dust. The staff seem stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to make some changes to make the office a happier and healthier place to work.""

'Chewing Gum: A Popular Habit
Chewing gum is a popular habit in the United States, where people chew 12 million sticks every day. But did you know that chewing gum has a long history? Let's find out how it became a big business.
Chewing gum contains very few calories, but it is still considered a food and must meet certain standards. Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, like pine resin and softeners, which help keep the flavor and texture. But this wasn't always the case.
A long time ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like substance from the bark of the mastic tree. Women especially liked it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists also chewed a resin that formed on spruce trees. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the United States.
In the 1860s, a new type of gum was discovered, made from the sap of the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more satisfying, and soon a whole industry was born. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have failed.
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials. The few people who still gather sapodilla have a difficult job, trekking through the rainforest to collect the sap. They face many dangers, including snakes and insects.
Despite the challenges, the remaining sapodilla gatherers are worried about their future. In the past, the United States used to import a lot of sapodilla from Central America, but now they import much less. Gum manufacturers are looking for ways to reduce costs and meet the demand.
In addition to its many uses, gum is also claimed to help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but our saliva helps to neutralize it. Chewing gum can increase saliva production, which helps to protect our teeth. Researchers are still working on new textures and flavors, using ingredients like glycerine and vegetable oils. Some flavors still need natural ingredients, and a lot of mint is grown in the United States to make the most popular gum flavors.'

The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown checks hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her at work. She was inspecting the Globe Hotel. The hotel had three red stars, which meant it was one of the best hotels in the country. But things didn't start well. The receptionist didn't even say hello to a guest on the phone. Sue thought this was a big mistake. She had seen this mistake many times before. The hotel had a long, empty corridor to get to the entrance, and the door was not manned. Sue was not impressed.
When the guest arrived, the receptionist said they didn't have a record of their booking. It turned out that many of the hotel's rooms were empty that night. Sue didn't like the top floor room because it was stuffy and had a big hole in the wall. She was not happy.
The next morning, Sue told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, all about the problems she found. He apologized for the smell in the main lounge and said they would fix it. Sue also suggested that the staff should not put guests in that room. Greaves took notes and looked unhappy.
But Sue also found some good things. The assistant manager and a young waitress were very helpful. The food was good, and the hotel had a lot of history. Sue told Greaves that the hotel could get three stars if they improved some things, like not serving a dessert that falls apart.
Sue's job is to tell hotels what they need to do to improve. Sometimes this can be difficult, and she gets complaints. But she thinks it's important to tell the truth, even if it's hard. She writes a report and sends it to the hotel, and they pay for the service. The hotel is lucky to have three stars, and Sue thinks it can keep them if it makes some changes."

**Conquering the Seven Summits**
I, Doug Scott, have climbed the highest mountain on each continent. This is my story of adventure and challenge.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia**
We climbed Mt. Everest, the highest mountain in Asia, in 1970. My climbing partner, Dougal Haston, and I were in a snow cave when he started talking to our guide about sleeping bags. I thought this was strange, but I later realized it was just the effect of high altitude. We were worried about the quality of our survival, not just the fact of surviving. After two days, I relived our time on the summit ridge and realized I had a great climbing partner. I learned to get a better rhythm to reach the summit.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America**
We climbed Mt. McKinley, the highest mountain in North America, in 1976. The mountain is very difficult and we had to carry our equipment and food up the mountain. We decided to climb 'alpine style', which meant we carried everything with us. We climbed up an avalanche scar and spent the night on a windswept ridge. We were both suffering, but we finally reached the summit.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa**
In 1976, my friend Paul Braithwaite and I climbed Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. We got lost in the jungle and had to find our way to the summit. We were worried about finding water, but we eventually found a rock pool and continued climbing. We took a new route to the summit, which was surreal.
**D. Aconcagua, South America**
In 1992, I climbed Aconcagua, the highest mountain in South America, with my wife Sharu. We joined a group of climbers going up the Polish Glacier, which was very windy and icy. We decided to miss the glacier and take a safer route to the summit.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica**
In 1992, I climbed Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in Antarctica. We had to guide a team of people to finance our trip. The weather was very cold and windy, but we reached the summit in just 8 hours.
**F. Elbrus, Europe**
In 1994, I climbed Elbrus, the highest mountain in Europe, with a team of climbers. We had to pay a commission to our guide for bringing us into the valley. We climbed to the summit and then returned to the refuge for the night.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia**
In 1994, I climbed Carstensz Pyramid, the highest mountain in Australasia, with a team of climbers. We wanted to establish a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. We climbed to the summit and were given a standing ovation.
I hope this simplified text helps you understand the story of my adventures climbing the Seven Summits."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. The garden has two long flower borders along a paved path. The previous owners of the house were good gardeners, and they left many plants that Susan likes. She also inherited a gardener named Danny. 
Susan prefers to paint individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She usually picks a flower, takes it to her studio, and paints it. Sometimes it takes a few days or even years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is in the spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. 
Susan has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wildflowers as a child and liked how they grew in unexpected places. Now, her garden has plants from all over the world. She doesn't mind if the plants grow where they want to, as long as they don't cause damage. With two upcoming exhibitions, Susan has been busy painting and hasn't had much time to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener to help, but she still likes to get her hands dirty to stay connected to her art.

Many trees in the town of Brackham were knocked down during a big storm in March. The town's main square lost two big lime trees. This changed the look of the town centre, and some people were not happy about it. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the police force, was one of those who was annoyed. However, he was too sick to notice at the time. He had bronchitis, a serious illness that made it hard for him to breathe.
Pelham's wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he didn't listen. He thought the police force needed him and that he could continue working. But this made his condition worse. He became very tired and his memory was affected. It wasn't until his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to get help.
When Pelham recovered, he was surprised to see that the big walnut tree in his garden had been knocked down. He had been too sick to notice earlier. His wife told him that the tree had been removed, and he was shocked to see the change in his living room. The tree had provided shade and made the room look nice, but now it was gone. The room was much brighter and his old furniture looked worn out. He also noticed that the house next door, which was previously hidden by the tree, was now visible and looked unattractive.
Pelham's wife, Molly, thought it was time to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost. She had been saying this for a while, but Pelham had not listened."

'Living in the valley We had lived in our valley for 16 months when we first realized that the hills around us could be dangerous. It was a year when the storms came early, before winter even started. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley, below the hills. Then snow started falling. It was deep and blocked our path. On the hills nearby, the snow was even deeper and stayed there for a long time. The wind was strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind, but we knew we should be worried. The snow and wind were not a big problem, but the river, the Ryburn, was. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills hadn't been controlled many years ago. The water was held back by dams. When the snow started melting, we watched the clouds growing bigger and bigger over the hills. The river started to fill up and become wilder every day. We were worried because the reservoir was almost full and could overflow. And then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. The water poured down the stream and the river became very wild. We were lucky that the dam held and the water went back down. We had seen this happen before, but now the dam keeps the river from flooding and we can enjoy the big clouds and the power of the river. We feel safe and secure in our valley.'

'I'm Mark Adams, a film critic for The Front Page newspaper. I've been writing about films for ten years now. Before this job, I did some film reviews for a magazine and some radio shows. I met my first editor, Tom Seaton, who also worked for radio and TV. He hired me, but he wasn't a journalist, so he didn't always make the best choices. At first, he wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, and film. We would meet for lunch and discuss what to review, and sometimes we had guests. It was a dream come true to be part of a new newspaper. But it didn't quite work out as planned. We didn't meet as a team, and we did everything by phone. People also preferred to associate a reviewer with one specific area, so I focused on film. Without Tom's idea, I might not be doing what I do now. I like my job because I can write longer pieces about one film, which gives me more freedom. I wouldn't want to review every film that comes out, as it would get boring. Instead, I can make my point and argue my case. I don't think I have to be right about a movie, and I don't think there should be a certain number of ""good"" or ""bad"" films each year. My job is to make an argument, not to judge.'"

Melanie doesn't have much of a social life because she trains so much. She doesn't like going to parties or talking about clothes and boys with her friends. Instead, she likes to talk about her training and how she can improve.
Melanie wants to do even tougher triathlons than she does now. She wants to find someone her age to train with, but it's hard to find someone who is as dedicated as she is.

I love collecting things and I'm not alone. Many people enjoy collecting and it's a world of passion and excitement. But remember, if you don't fall in love with an object, don't collect it. People have been collecting things for thousands of years. Even in ancient times, people collected stones and seashells because they liked their shapes and colors. I've been collecting all my life. I started with stones from my parents' garden and then moved on to flowers, pottery, and paintings. When I was a child, my parents would take me to the local museum and I was fascinated by the objects on display. Many people collect things, and the reasons why are interesting. Some people collect because it's the only part of their life where they have complete control. For me, collecting is just something I enjoy doing.
There are many famous collectors, like the Duc de Berry in France, who had a room full of unusual objects. Another famous collector was Catherine the Great of Russia, who had over 4,000 paintings. You don't have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I've collected all sorts of things, from tulip bulbs to china cups. I've even searched for rare American rag dolls and looked for variations in design. Unfortunately, my collection of 350 rag dolls was destroyed in a fire. It's interesting to see how collections change hands and how the value of objects can increase over time. For example, old toys from the 1950s are now valuable if you still have the original boxes. I wish I had kept mine!

'Changing Jobs Are you unhappy in your job? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. If you want to change your job, you can talk to a careers adviser. They will ask you about your past and then give you some tests. The tests show what you are good at and what you like doing. The adviser will then suggest some new jobs and what training you might need.
I tried Career Analysts, a big company that helps with career choices. The tests were like my school exams. I had to answer questions quickly with a group of people. It was hard to understand how the tests would show who I am. The tests asked me to find mistakes in lists and match shapes. Then I talked to an adviser and he gave me a report with his ideas and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was surprised to find out I didn't do well in the science and practical tests. I'm glad I didn't become a nurse!
You don't have to change your job completely. Donna Laney, 25, lost her job and went to Career Analysts for help. She wanted to think about her career and what she was good at. Some of the results surprised her. She hadn't realized she was good at design. But she had to think about the cost of training and her financial situation. Other ideas were to take a year off and work in the Far East. In the end, she used her existing skills and changed to a job in public relations.
Some people feel that they wouldn't have changed their job without help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and made big decisions. She was unhappy in her job at a bank and didn't know what she wanted to do. The tests showed she was interested in science.

'Fun at the Dentist's?
Dr. W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in Glasgow is a modern and relaxing place. The walls are painted bright colors, and patients sit on a blue couch while he checks their teeth. Dr. Jerome says many people only go to the dentist when they have a problem, not for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared. To make patients feel more at ease, Dr. Jerome has created a friendly atmosphere. He doesn't wear a white coat, which can make people feel anxious. He wants patients to feel relaxed, interested, and even enjoy their visit.
Dr. Jerome uses special techniques to make patients feel calm. One of these is virtual-reality headsets. Patients wear the headsets during their initial check-up and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Dr. Jerome examines their teeth. The headsets are very popular. The surgery also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Dr. Jerome wants patients to feel comfortable and relaxed from the moment they walk in.
Although Dr. Jerome is known for being fashionable, he takes his work very seriously. He uses special instruments to clean teeth, which makes the process less painful. Dr. Jerome believes that making patients feel comfortable makes it easier for him to do his job. He has even introduced a patient-centered approach to dentistry, which is a new way of thinking in the UK.
As I sit in the surgery, I can see that Dr. Jerome is very good at making patients feel at ease. He offers them tea and lets them choose what video they want to watch. The surgery feels like a beauty parlour, not a dentist's office.'

'Chocolate has a long history. It started in South America over 3,000 years ago. Today, it's a big business worth millions of pounds. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is a lot of money! Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.
The cacao tree is a tropical plant that grows in many countries. The fruit of the tree has 20-40 seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. They can be used to make chocolate.
A long time ago, the Aztecs used cacao beans as money. They also used them to make a drink called xocoatl. This drink was bitter and was used on special occasions.
The Spanish liked the drink better when it was mixed with cinnamon and sugar. But it took another 100 years for the recipe to spread to the rest of Europe. In the 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in big cities. People would gather there to drink chocolate.
In the past, chocolate was made from solid blocks that had to be melted down. But in 1826, a man from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate.
In 1847, a company in Bristol made a solid chocolate bar that you could eat. Later, a Swiss company added milk to the recipe and created milk chocolate.
Today, chocolate is a big business. But some farmers who grow the cacao beans are still struggling. Many of them were forced out of business when the price of cacao beans dropped in the 1980s.'

Peter Cooke is 83 years old and has become very good at making things with shells. He has been doing it for 10 years and wants to keep improving. He makes beautiful and unusual objects, like ornaments for the fireplace. He showed me his work and said, ""Tell me if I'm boring you."" But he's not boring because he's enthusiastic and charming.
Peter started making things with shells by accident. Some friends said, ""You should have an exhibition to show your work."" Now he has two exhibitions and people buy his work for a lot of money. He doesn't set the prices, but he thinks his work is worth it because nobody else makes things like this.
Peter is very good at what he does. He uses cardboard, glue, and soap to make his creations. He finds shells on beaches all around the world, from France to the Philippines. He only takes dead shells, not live ones, and he doesn't think it's wrong to collect them. He says that people who walk on the beach and break the shells up are doing more harm than him.
Peter wishes he had started making things with shells earlier, but he's still happy with what he's achieved. He's proud of his work and wants to keep making it.

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old model who has won a competition. When she's not traveling to new places and appearing on magazine covers, she's usually studying for her school exams. I went to interview her at her modeling agency.
The receptionist told me that Kira would be late, but when she arrived, she was smiling and apologetic. She was with her mother, who was very proud of her daughter. Kira was wearing a simple dress and trainers, not fancy clothes. She seemed like a normal, friendly, and pretty girl.
Kira is still in school, and her older sister encouraged her to enter the model competition. Kira didn't want to, but her sister sent in her photos anyway. When she won, it gave her the confidence to continue modeling. Now, she works for a modeling agency in London.
It's hard for Kira to balance her two lives - school and modeling. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are mean and say she's too full of herself. Kira says that's not true, and she's just more confident now.
As a model, Kira's social life is affected. The agency can call her at any time and ask her to work the next day. She can't make plans with her friends because she doesn't know what she'll be doing tomorrow. But her friends are understanding and don't get upset.
Kira has a bright future ahead of her, and she's still in school. If she didn't become a model, she would like to be a journalist like me.

After 10 years of digging, they have found high levels of gold, but they need to dig a little deeper to get to the good stuff. They have been searching for gold for a long time and have spent all their savings. Now they need to find someone to give them £50,000 to help them finish the job. The town where they are digging, Dolgellau, relies on tourists, and the locals are hoping that if the men find gold, it will bring more visitors to the area. However, some people are worried about the environmental impact of all the digging. The gold industry in Wales used to be very big, but now it's almost gone.

'Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She studies the chemicals in the sea and teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes down to the ocean floor in a special vehicle that's like a small car. It takes her three hours to get there, and she stays for ten hours collecting samples. Then she goes back up to the surface.
The vehicle is very small, so she has to stay inside until someone lets her out. If something goes wrong, she can press a button and a small escape vessel will take her to the surface quickly. Rachel has made six dives. She's even gone down with a Russian team to study underwater volcanoes.
When she's not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She teaches to earn money, but she loves it because it helps her do her research on underwater volcanoes. She's very interested in the ""black smokers"" - underwater volcanoes that shoot out hot water and black smoke.
Rachel has had some scary moments, like when there was an explosion while she was collecting equipment. But she's also felt an amazing sense of wonder when she looks out of the window and sees the underwater volcanoes. She's very lucky to be able to see these things that no one else has seen before.'

'I was tired, dirty, and hungry after my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted and my mind was overwhelmed by foreign languages, timetables, and currencies. I thought, ""I'll never do this again!"" But the next year, I did the same thing. And the year after that. The best part was that I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month with just one train ticket.
Traveling by train is different from staying in hotels. You have to carry all your belongings in a backpack, which makes you think differently about your trip. You might even throw away things you don't need anymore. This way of traveling is very common among young people who use the Inter-Rail ticket.
The ticket allows you to travel to many countries in a short time. My friends and I thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in France, but we ended up traveling to many more places. We didn't plan our trip carefully, so we only saw the most obvious sights. We were happy just to be on our own and have fun.
We were not interested in culture, but we were excited to see new places. The best part of traveling is discovering a new city for the first time. It's like the city didn't exist until you see it with your own eyes. You can't understand Europe until you see it for yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos are boring. The train trip is a special experience that helps you understand Europe better.'

""Lost luggage is a common problem for travelers. When you arrive at the airport, you might find that your bag is not there. This can be frustrating, especially if you have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Some airlines don't tell us how many bags they lose, but it's a fact that sometimes luggage gets lost. Even good airlines can make mistakes. The airline system works like this: they want you to check in early so that your bag has time to get to the plane. They also have rules for connecting flights. These rules are in place to make sure your bag gets to the right plane. But sometimes, things go wrong. Flights are delayed, and bags get lost. This can happen even at big airports. For example, Heathrow Airport in London handles a lot of passengers, and sometimes bags get lost. It's better to take a direct flight if you can. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline. You can also make sure your bag gets to the right plane by giving it a label with your name and address. If your bag still gets lost, you should tell the airline staff at the airport and fill out a special form. You should do this before you leave the airport.""

'The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, casting a shadow on the water. The main colours are soft greens, browns, and yellows. The kingfisher is very fast and can be hard to see. Charlie James loves kingfishers. He can't explain why, but he's been fascinated with them since he was a child. Kingfishers are special birds. In Greek mythology, a kingfisher is said to be a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its top half turned blue and its bottom half got scorched by the sun. There's some truth to this story. Kingfishers don't actually have blue feathers, but the way their feathers are structured makes them look blue. This is why they can change colour depending on the light. Many photographers love taking pictures of kingfishers because of their beautiful colours and because they can be easy to see if you hide near their favourite spots. Charlie James started hiding near a kingfisher's spot when he was a teenager. It took him four years to get a good picture. He loves kingfishers so much that he missed school and became an ""academic failure"". But his love for kingfishers led him to work as a photographer and filmmaker. Now, he wants to make a film about kingfishers that just shows their beauty without any words. He loves the simple things about kingfishers, like their colours and the way they move.'

Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
**A. Anne Manson**
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She was surprised when she was asked to help with an opera the next season. She says, ""I wasn't nervous. I'm always confident when standing in front of an orchestra."" Anne works with a well-known opera company in London and has also worked in other European countries.
**B. Andrew Constantine**
Andrew Constantine, 31, won a big competition in 1991. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting people to give him opportunities. He is grateful that he won the competition when he did. It gave him many performance chances and a chance to work with a famous conductor.
**C. Wasfi Kani**
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice time for opera productions. She says, ""The music is worth four weeks of attention."" Wasfi started conducting in her late 20s. She worked in London's commercial center until her opera company became professional two years ago.
**D. Roger Vignoles**
Roger Vignoles, 48, says conducting came as a surprise to him. However, he enjoyed it and found it fascinating. He started as a musician at an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival. He found it easier than he thought and was happy with the result.

Wayne Marshall, 32, was noticed by conductor Simon Rattle in 1986. He soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice. He had to deal with some musicians who were not taking their job seriously. He says, ""I was firm with them and got the best result I could.""

**Variations on a Theme: Theme Parks in Britain**
If you want to take your children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to try out the best ones. Here's what they thought:
**Fun Island**
The Burns family went to Fun Island and were surprised by how much they enjoyed it. The park has lots of rides for young children, so their three-year-old didn't feel left out. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special ride for the very young kids, which was a big hit. Older kids can try scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! The only thing they didn't like was that the park wasn't very exciting to look at.
**Wonderland**
The McMillan family had never been to a theme park before, but they loved Wonderland. Their three-year-old, Oscar, had a great time on the Mountain Train and loved the little replicas of famous buildings. The older kids enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a special road. They spent six hours there and were happy to rest their feet. The park is very clean and the staff are friendly.
**Adventure World**
The Jeffree family spent seven hours at Adventure World and still didn't see everything. The kids loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line, which was a bit scary. They also enjoyed Running River, where you think you'll get wet but don't. For younger kids, Toy Land is lots of fun. The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't boring. It's also very clean and the staff are great.
**The Great Park**
The Langridge family visited The Great Park and were a bit disappointed that it only closed at 5 pm. The park is great for younger kids because the rides aren't too scary. They loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. They also enjoyed Lightning River, which was over before they knew it!
**Fantasy World**
The Break-all family thought Fantasy World was a lot of fun. They loved Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, and the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres high. The older kids went on the main rides several times, but some of the staff were not very friendly.

It was hard at first, but she was careful with money and worked from home. She likes being her own boss and can work in the evenings if she wants.
**B. Maggy Sasanow**
Maggy is a designer who works from home. She used to work in art, but moved to the countryside after she got married. She started her own business making greetings cards. She sells them to museums and works in a big room at home. She likes being independent, but sometimes misses working with others.
**C. Delia Turner**
Delia started a curtain-making business eight years ago. It was successful at first, but then the economy got bad and she had to lay off her employees. Now she works from home with her husband's help and some part-time workers. She has to be careful with prices and look for new opportunities.
**D. Tessa Strickland**
Tessa runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside for financial reasons and because she loves the country. She likes being able to work whenever she wants. She has to make international phone calls at odd hours and has to be disciplined to close her office.
**E. Meg Rivers**
Meg runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She started making cakes at home ten years ago and soon got requests from friends and relatives. She now employs six people and has a turnover of £250,000 a year. Her biggest problem is the financial side of the business.

Meet the Amazing Watkins Family
The Watkins family is very talented. The brothers, Paul and Huw, are musicians, and their father, John, makes musical instruments. It's not common to find a family with such a combination of skills.
When Paul was 10 years old, he wanted to play the cello. His parents, John and Hetty, looked for a cello, but it was too expensive. So, John decided to make one himself. He took evening classes at a school for instrument makers and made a few cellos. Paul used one of them until recently.
John now makes violins full-time and sells them to musicians. One of his violins was even bought by a famous American player. Paul and Huw were encouraged to play music from a young age. They started with the piano, but Paul soon moved to the cello.
Paul won a competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra when he was just 20 years old. He played his father's cello until recently, when he got a new one from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul's father is proud of his son's success and has even tried playing his new cello.
Paul will soon perform on television, playing a famous cello concerto. His brother Huw will also perform at the Wigmore Hall that same evening. Their parents will have to work hard to keep track of their sons' musical activities.

**Looking after the countryside**
The National Trust is a group that works to protect the British countryside. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talked to Gareth Roberts, a warden who takes care of the beautiful areas owned by the Trust.
To be a warden, you need common sense and to be good at dealing with people. Gareth says that's because you have to work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies.
Gareth was born and grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula. He used to work on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job as warden for the Lleyn Peninsula, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he didn't have any special training.
Gareth's farming background is useful because he can understand the problems of local farmers and work with them. He also enjoys the physical part of the job, like building fences and planting trees.
Gareth says that he has learned more about nature conservation since he started working for the Trust. He used to collect flowers and butterfly larvae when he was a child, and now he realizes that farming has changed the countryside. He thinks that farmers and conservationists should work together.
Gareth's job involves making sure that projects are finished quickly and efficiently, and talking to the public. He enjoys seeing projects finished, but sometimes he has to deal with difficult people. He thinks that you need to have common sense to be a good warden.
If you like the outdoors and want to work in a job like Gareth's, you might consider applying to become a warden. But there might not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time.

'My life is all about being the best for the World Championships,' says Kendra. 'I have a strict schedule to get fit.'
These are Kendra's fourth World Championships. This year, 27 countries will take part. 'We'll have home support, which is great,' she says. 'We want to improve the reputation of netball in England. There will be more pressure, but we're ready.' Their first game is against Barbados. 'We usually win, but they're a good team.'
England is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra says the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to play well every day, with no rest between games. But you can still win even if you lose the first game.' In the 15 years she's played at the top level, netball has become faster and harder. 'You don't train to lose,' she says. 'But after the game, we're all friends again.'
Netball is now more scientific about fitness testing. 'We all have to think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I lead by example and support my team.' Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. This will be her last big event as a player. She will probably cry during the opening ceremony.'

'Special Music Schools for Gifted Children
Some children show a special talent for music. But it's not always easy to help them develop this gift. Parents may not know how to support their child's musical abilities, and the child may become frustrated if their needs are not met. Most schools are good at helping children who are good at other subjects, but music schools are needed for children who are exceptionally talented in music.
There are five special music schools in Britain that offer a unique environment for children aged 7-18 to develop their musical skills. These schools have professional musicians as teachers and offer a variety of musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, and chamber groups. Students also have time to practice in private rooms with a teacher.
The schools are independent and have small classes with a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they are surrounded by other children who share their passion for music.
However, there are some disadvantages. The schools are expensive, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year. Some parents may not want their child to live away from home, especially at a young age. The schools also have to make sure that students are not too stressed by the intense musical training.
It's important to consider whether a special music school is the right choice for a child. Some people think that it's better to wait until the child is older before making a decision. Others may prefer a different option, such as a school with a good music department or music lessons on Saturdays. But for families who live near a major city, this option may not be available.'

""Want to get your writing published? If you're not sure where to send your story, Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many people write to us asking, 'Can you tell me where to send my story?' First, you need to research the market and find out about publishers. You also need to keep improving your writing skills. To get your writing published, you need to know about the writing business. This means reading a lot and finding out what kinds of writing publishers are looking for. You can do this by visiting your local library and bookstores. Reading widely will help you understand what types of writing are popular at the moment. As new publications come out, you need to keep updating your knowledge. 
If you're not sure what kind of writing you want to do, start by finding out which magazines publish the kind of writing you like. For example, if you like writing love stories, find out which magazines publish them and read recent copies. Then, think about what kind of stories these magazines like to publish and who their readers are. These readers will expect certain things from the magazine, and the editor will only publish stories that meet their needs.
Don't send your writing out too early. It's unlikely that your first story will be published. Most successful writers have been writing for a long time before they get published. When you do send your work out, keep writing and improving it while you wait for a response. Write many stories and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Join a writing group or take a creative writing course to help you improve and get ideas from other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and write every day if you can."""

A well-dressed man was walking around, talking to strangers. He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to New York. He didn't ask me, even though I was also going to Philadelphia. He seemed stressed and kept asking people if they were going to Philadelphia. I thought he was strange.

When I saw the restaurant, it was in a bad state, but it was perfect for me. It reminded me of my childhood when my mother went to work and I was left alone. I wanted to have time for family life, so my wife took care of the children and did the accounts, and I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped our children, Gary and Joe, become confident. Gary was a lively child. When he was small, he loved playing in the bath and even knocked himself out! As he grew up, he started helping out in the kitchen and earned a lot of money. He was very disciplined and would wake up early. I was proud to see him helping out in the family business. Gary wasn't good at school, but he was amazing in the kitchen. By the time he was 15, he was as good as the other chefs. He even took charge sometimes! Gary recently started playing the drums and has his own band. Who knows what will happen to his cooking if his music takes off? My advice to him is to focus on one thing at a time. He understood when I told him that if he wants to be successful, he needs to work hard and achieve his goals by the age of 30. Gary went to catering college at 17 and surprised everyone by preparing all the food on his first day. He's now a successful TV chef, and I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. He's taken the opportunity he was given and made the most of it.

Finding a flat in Dublin was very difficult. Jo had just moved to Dublin and didn't know anyone who could help her find a place to live. She had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat by herself. Jo felt a bit scared because she didn't know what to expect.
Jo's friends from school thought she was crazy for moving to Dublin. They all thought it was a big city and she would be alone. Jo's parents also had mixed opinions. Her mother thought it would be safe for her to stay in a hostel run by nuns, but her father was worried it might be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for so long.
Jo found an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that seemed too good to be true. It said she could have her own room, TV, and share the kitchen and bathroom. The flat was near her work and looked ordinary, not fancy. When she arrived, she met a girl named Nessa who was also applying for the flat. Nessa warned Jo that the flatmates were not nice. Jo decided to ignore this and went upstairs to see the flat.
When she got there, she met Pauline, a girl with colorful hair and a psychedelic shirt. Pauline was a punk, which Jo had never met before. Pauline and Nessa were making tea and invited Jo to join them. They offered to put Jo's name on a mug if she decided to move in.

'Dolphins are loved by many people. We enjoy watching them in movies, TV shows, and at the seaside. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, their situation is very serious. Dolphins are highly intelligent, sensitive, and allow us to dream of a free life in the ocean. This love for dolphins has been encouraged by TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest. But these happy stories hide the reality of life for dolphins in polluted and overfished seas. The number of harbour porpoises in the North Sea has decreased by up to 89,000.
You might expect these popular animals to be protected by law and cared for in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and the lack of plans to protect them may become one of the biggest environmental disasters of our time.
There are 40 different types of dolphins worldwide. In European waters, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose, and harbour porpoise dolphins. The striped and common dolphins live far out at sea and are rarely seen. The bottlenose and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts, but now they are mostly found in a few areas. The bottlenose dolphins are social and used to be found in the Channel and British rivers, but now they are only found in a few places.
It's difficult to understand why the number of dolphins is decreasing. Overfishing is a major problem, as it reduces the number of fish and threatens local fishing industries. Dolphins also get caught in fishing nets, which can be invisible to them. In recent years, many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornish beaches, with marks and cuts on their bodies showing that they were caught in nets.
Dolphins can also be poisoned by waste and substances in the sea. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies and be passed on to their babies. There have been cases of dolphins being poisoned by their mother's milk. The biggest threat to dolphins, however, is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and communicate through sound, but noise pollution from ships, oil wells, and other sources can disturb them in ways we don't yet understand.'

""Exercise is important for our overall well-being. It's a great way to stay balanced and healthy in today's fast-paced world. There are many reasons why exercise is good for us. It helps us build strong muscles, improves our posture, and prevents injuries. It also helps with specific areas like our thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Exercise is good for our heart, lungs, and blood circulation too.
But did you know that exercise can also help with depression, tiredness, and stress? It can even help with certain medical conditions. There are many types of exercise we can do, such as aerobics, jogging, and weightlifting. However, it's important to start slowly and carefully to avoid injury.
Good posture is also important. Imagine a helium balloon attached to the top of your head, lifting you up and helping you stand tall. This can help improve your posture and make you look and feel better. Stretching is also important to improve flexibility and prevent injuries.
A good exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, a strong workout, and a cool-down. By following these steps, you can stay fit and healthy.""

""WHY THEY LOVE FILMING WILDLIFE
Film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman spend months away from home to get the perfect shot. They are always on the lookout for exciting wildlife footage in East Africa. The Ngorongoro Crater is their current home, but it's been raining non-stop for six months, causing problems. Owen says they had to buy a special vehicle to help get them out of the mud.
Amanda and Owen have worked together for many years, making popular TV films about animals. They are known for their attention to detail and their ability to get close to the animals. Owen says they have the occasional disagreement, but they usually sort it out quickly. They don't like to argue about who is in charge, and they both love animals in the same way.
When they're on location, they set up their tents and make tea the night before. They eat pre-cooked meals and heat them up in the morning. Sometimes they're away for up to eight weeks, which can be challenging. But the reward is getting close to the animals and becoming part of their lives. Owen remembers filming a family of lions and how one lioness would come to say hello to their car every day.
Amanda and Owen have been working together since 1988. They spend four months filming for each half-hour documentary. Before they start filming, they submit a script for approval. They want their films to be emotional and engaging, and to show the true spirit of the animals and their habitats.""

'England's Netball Captain
We are talking to Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. She is very busy preparing for the World Championships next month. She teaches at a local school during the day and then trains in a car park. I was surprised to hear about her training venue. 'I don't notice what's around me when I'm training,' she said. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet.'
Kendra's life is all about getting ready for the World Championships. She follows a strict schedule to stay fit. This is her fourth World Championships and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 teams taking part. 'We'll have the support of our home crowd, which is great,' she said. 'And it's important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. We will have more pressure than usual because of the home crowd. They will expect us to play well and cheer us on.'
Their first game is against Barbados. They have played them before, but it will be exciting. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But Kendra says the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to give your best every day, there's no rest between games. And you can still win even if you lose the first game. But in the Championships, there's only one chance to win.'
Netball has become a faster and more aggressive sport in the 15 years since Kendra started playing at a high level. 'You don't train hard not to win,' she said. But after the game, everyone becomes friends again.
Netball is also using new methods to test fitness. 'We all need to think and train like world-class players,' said Kendra. As captain, she thinks it's important to have a strong attitude and lead by example. She will support and encourage her teammates.
Kendra has always planned her netball career carefully. She has decided that this will be her last big competition as a player. She will probably coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her last big event. When she leads her team out onto the court for the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her fans will be cheering her on every step of the way.'

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes down to the ocean floor in a special vehicle called a submersible. It's like a small car that takes her down to the bottom of the ocean.
Inside the submersible, there's very little space. Rachel has to stay seated and can't stand up or move around. She has to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can take up to 16 hours. Rachel says it's like being in a small space with the two pilots. They have to work together and can't get out until they reach the surface.
Rachel has made six dives so far. She's been to a place in the Atlantic Ocean where there are many underwater volcanoes. She's studied these volcanoes, called ""black smokers"", for three years. They're very hot and produce black smoke that comes out of the rock at a rate of one metre per second.
Rachel has had some scary moments during her dives. Once, there was an explosion and she thought she was going to die. But luckily, they were okay. Rachel loves diving to the deepest part of the ocean. She feels a sense of wonder when she looks out of the window and sees the volcanoes.

**Interview Tips**
When we meet someone for the first time, we often form an impression of them quickly. People notice how we dress, our eye contact, body language, and how we speak. Mary Pearce, a teacher, learned this the hard way. She didn't get a job at a school because the Head Teacher thought she didn't present herself well.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, agrees. He says that if someone doesn't take care of their appearance, they might not care about their job. Many people ignore the importance of dressing professionally. Janet Goodwood, an administrative assistant, was surprised when she wasn't given an interview for a promotion because she didn't fit the image of an office manager.
Our body language and facial expressions also play a big role in making a good impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 55% of our message comes from our facial expressions. We should make sure our words and body language match.
It's also important not to show too much enthusiasm for a job or be too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, learned this the hard way. She was offered a job, but the boss offered her a lower salary because he knew she would accept it.
Finally, it's a good idea to prepare for an interview by learning about the company and having a few questions ready. Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests speaking in short sentences and avoiding long, confusing sentences.

**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
A Darius (runner) I love sports. I used to play many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country's youth team and getting a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much attention from the media, so I didn't get any sponsorship. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun, but I have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. My goal is to go to the next Olympics.
B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so we see the same people everywhere we compete. Professional surfers are very serious, and the best waves are often at dawn. If you want to be good, you can't go out late at night. I don't mind giving up late nights, but I love sleeping in, and I usually have to give that up too. It's worth it, because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I like to celebrate with a big night out, and if there's money involved, I'll go somewhere nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run.
C Dieter (yacht racer) With five friends on a boat, we have a great time. We're traditional and always celebrate a win well. We don't try to get attention from the media, but sometimes they're more interested in where we go out and what we do there than in our racing results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's great to come back and do normal things with my friends. You can't live, eat, and breathe your sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I'm not a celebrity. I get nice letters from people asking for signed pictures, and I always reply.
D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd supporting you. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. I do still get a thrill from being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. As tennis players, we have to travel a lot, and that's why we split up. That was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport. I'm happy to focus on my game now and catch up on the other things in life when I retire.

'Shopping with children can be very difficult for some parents. They often want everything they see, especially if it's something new and exciting. This can be a problem because parents can't afford everything and may feel guilty if they say yes, but also feel bad if they say no. Some parents try to avoid taking their children shopping because it can be stressful. However, this can also mean the children don't learn how to make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes while shopping. Advertisers spend a lot of money trying to get children to want certain products, especially on TV. This can make it hard for parents to explain why they can't buy everything their children want.
Many parents are worried about what their children eat and have ideas about what is healthy. But children may not understand why they can't have certain foods. Parents feel like they are competing with advertisers and it can be hard to say no to their children.
Some parents find it stressful to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says she tries to explain to her son why he can't have certain things, but it's hard to be consistent. Another parent says they sometimes buy things they know are bad for their children just to make them happy.
Supermarkets could make shopping easier for parents by moving sweets to a different part of the store or providing a play area for children. This might make parents want to shop there more often.'

'Ice Skating
Ice skating has a long history. People have been skating for thousands of years. The first skates were made from animal bones. They were used until iron was introduced to Scandinavia, around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, skating was important for the rich people. 
In the early 20th century, skating was popular among the rich. But in 1924, a young girl named Sonja Henie changed the way people skated. She introduced a more athletic style, and this made skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and sport. It is both beautiful and physically demanding.
To start skating, you need to balance and control. You need to be relaxed and move slowly at first. As you get better, you can go faster. The way you stand is important. Keep your knees bent and your weight centred. 
It's important to know how to fall safely. Even good skaters fall sometimes. If you fall, try to relax and roll with the fall. To get up, get on your hands and knees and then stand up.
There are different types of skating, like figure skating, freestyle, and speed skating. But it's best to start with figure skating and then learn freestyle. Most ice rinks have instructors who can teach you.
Skating can help you improve your balance, coordination, and relaxation. It can also make your heart and lungs stronger. Skating is a great way to stay healthy and fit, especially when combined with other sports like swimming or jogging.'

'It's true - we're all getting taller! Chris Greener was 14 when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' Chris was already very tall at 14, and now he is the tallest man in Britain, at 228 cm. Every year, people in Europe are getting taller by about 1 cm. This is because we are eating better and getting more nutrients. In the past, our ancestors used to eat a variety of foods, like fruits, berries, and animals. They were healthy and strong. Then, about 9,000 years ago, people started growing crops, like wheat, rice, and maize. This was good for the population, but it meant that people were eating less variety of foods and getting less nutrients. This has had a negative effect on our health and height. In some places, people who used to be healthy and strong became sickly and underweight. 
Now, in some countries like Europe, the US, and Japan, people are eating a more varied diet again and getting taller. The average height in these countries is now around 177-180 cm. However, this means that we need to adapt our furniture, clothes, and transportation to accommodate our growing height. But, scientists say that there is a limit to how tall we can get. They think we might reach a maximum height of around 193 cm this century. On the other hand, some scientists believe that as the planet warms up, we might actually get smaller again. So, it's hard to predict what will happen to our height in the future.'"

'I like places that have a human touch. When I travel, I prefer visiting small villages with old buildings, not empty deserts. When I was a child, I went to school in England and loved exploring the countryside on my bike. I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. The landscape was familiar yet different from my home in Scotland. I still visit this place today.
I also like taking the train from Hythe to Dungeness. The scenery is not very exciting, but I enjoy seeing the everyday life of people in their backyards. I see myself in their eyes, looking into their homes.
My friends like visiting the Hartland Peninsula, a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are difficult to reach, so there are not many tourists. They like to walk along the coast and reflect on the sea. The coast is known for shipwrecks, and there are beautiful valleys with oak trees and wild flowers.
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a big open area for hiking. It's a quiet and remote place, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered this area by chance and have been visiting it every year. It's special because I can share it with my family now.
I also have a special house in Britain, called Glenthorne. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon, England. I used to dream about this house and its beautiful surroundings. It's a peaceful and romantic place where you can only hear the sound of the sea, wind, and birds.'

WE LOVE ANIMALS
We are a family who loves animals. One day, my daughter called me at work and said, ""Mom, we found a snake!"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We have a special tank for animals that come to visit. I was late getting home, so I quickly boiled some water. When I arrived, I saw that our cat, Domino, had caught a mouse. The kids were screaming, ""Mom, help!""
Domino was running around the room with the mouse in his mouth. He was looking for a way to get out. I tried to help, but I tripped and fell. When I got up, I saw the snake had escaped from its tank. It was slithering around the room. The kids and the cat were all trying to catch it. The snake was hissing and striking. The dog was barking loudly.
I finally managed to catch the cat and rescue the mouse. The snake was very slippery, but I was able to catch it too. I sat on the floor and slowly raised the snake's body. It was very strong and powerful. I decided to let it go in the garden. The kids helped me guide it to a tree. When I finally let go of the snake's head, it slid away and wrapped itself around my shoulders. It was very comfortable there.
We stood there in silence for a moment. Then my oldest son said, ""You're nice and warm, Mom, and the shed isn't."" I had the kids help me encourage the snake to move away. It slowly went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of the snake disappeared, my three-year-old son said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!""

It's exciting to wait for it to arrive, to see who it's from, and to enjoy reading the message. I've been writing letters all my life. When I was a child, I would write notes to my mother. My mother always wanted me to write thank-you letters for birthdays and Christmas presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy - just that they were letters. When I left home to study medicine in London, I wrote to my mother every week. My father would sometimes write too, and I loved reading his funny letters. The letters from home were usually about everyday things, like what my parents and their friends were doing. We would also phone each other, but I remember the letters more. I've had penfriends from different countries, like Sri Lanka and Australia. I also have a friend in France who I met by chance at a restaurant.

'Tourists are damaging ancient rock art in the French Alps. The site, called Mont Bego, has 36,000 drawings on rocks that are 4,000 years old. The drawings show cows, fields, and gods and goddesses. But as more tourists visit, the drawings are being ruined by graffiti. Scientists are worried that if the damage continues, the drawings will not survive for future generations.
Jean Clottes, a scientist, says that people think the drawings will always be there, but they will be gone in 50 years if the damage continues. He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, wearing them away. Some visitors even take parts of the drawings home as souvenirs.
Experts disagree on the best way to save the drawings. Henry de Lumley, a museum director, thinks the whole mountain should be closed to the public except for guided tours. But Jean Clottes thinks this is too extreme and might cause protests. Another expert, David Lavergne, suggests charging a fee to visit the site to raise money for guards.
Annie Echassoux, a researcher, thinks the site should be roped off and guided tours provided. She believes the government should provide the necessary funds to protect the site, as it is a historic monument.'

**Shopping with Children: A Challenge for Parents**
For many parents, taking their children to the supermarket can be a stressful experience. Children often want everything they see, from the latest cereal to a Disney video or a comic. Parents feel guilty when they say no, but they also don't want to buy things that are not good for their children. It's hard to say no all the time, but saying yes too often can make parents feel guilty.
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes while shopping. The advertising industry spends a lot of money on TV ads, and supermarkets are where they are most successful. Children often don't understand why they can't have everything they want, and the ads make it hard for them to make good choices.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that parents are concerned about what their children eat, but they may not always know what is healthy. It's important for parents to talk to their children about food, but it's hard to compete with the advertising industry.
Some parents feel stressed when deciding what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says she tries to explain to her son that ads are not always honest, and now they don't argue much about what to buy. Other parents admit that they are inconsistent and sometimes buy things they know are not good for their children.
Supermarkets could help reduce the stress by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This could make shopping more enjoyable for parents and children alike.

""Climbing has changed a lot. Climbers used to go to mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. A climber named Francois Lombard is competing in the World Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This place is famous for another event, the TV show Gladiators. Both events use a special wall.
The wall is new and developing. Until the 1960s, climbers climbed on cliffs. But it was hard to find good climbing spots. In the winter, they had to go walking or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. Climbers needed to stay fit, so they started using brick-edges and stone buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong.
Many sports centers built walls for climbing. They used special bricks with edges to hold onto. A teacher named Don Robinson built a climbing wall at his school in Leeds in the 1960s. He had the idea to put real rock in a block of concrete and add it to a wall. Many walls were built like this in the 1970s. But they had problems. They could only be built straight up and down, not like the cliffs outside. Climbers got bored with the same old holds.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a special material that could be shaped like the rocks on cliffs. It could be attached to any wall and taken off when climbers got bored. French companies also tried using steel frames with panels. This made it possible to build walls with overhangs and different angles. Climbers could change the holds and never get bored.""

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a B1 level:
Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to make a career as an actor, they might say it's a risky job. And they're right. There are more people who want to be actors than there are acting jobs available. When you decide to become an actor, some of your friends might think you're crazy, but others might be supportive. Everyone has their own opinion, and it's a personal choice. You're the only one who can make it happen.
It's not easy to become an actor. There's no special exam you need to pass, and there's no guarantee of success. It's a mix of luck and talent. But there are always new opportunities for new faces and new talent. Acting can be exciting, glamorous, and sometimes very rewarding.
People often ask what makes someone a good actor. I think it's a combination of natural ability and imagination. And it takes a lot of courage to believe in yourself and your work. Where does the desire to act come from? It's hard to explain, but for many actors, it's about the connection they make with the audience.
When actors talk about their success, they often shrug and say they don't know. They might know some things about themselves and their skills, but they never take anything for granted. They know that their next job might be their last. Disappointment is a big fear for actors.
Actors often don't talk about their chances of getting a part. They find ways to deal with the stress and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected, and it's a possibility from the start. When you audition for a part, you're saying you're available, willing, and talented. If you don't care, nobody else will.

'Chris Greener is a tall man. He is 228 cm tall, which is the tallest in Britain. When he was 14, he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked what he wanted to be. Chris said he wanted to be the flagpole on a ship. This was because he was already very tall at 14.
Did you know that people are getting taller every year? This is because we are eating better food. In the past, people didn't eat as well as we do now. They ate a lot of bread, soup, and porridge. This made them shorter and less healthy.
In the past, people used to eat many different foods, like fruits, vegetables, and animals. But then, people started farming and eating more bread, rice, and corn. This made them taller, but not as healthy.
Now, people are eating better again, and we are getting taller. In some countries, like the US, Holland, and Japan, people are getting taller. But, we can't keep growing forever. There must be a limit to how tall we can get.
Some scientists think that humans were actually shorter and rounder in the past, when it was colder. Now that it's warmer, we are getting thinner and shorter. This means that even if we eat well, we might not get any taller.
So, the question is: how tall can we get? Will we keep growing, or will we stop? Only time will tell.'"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at the B1 level:
Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are making a success of their childhood game, pichenotte. They are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, playing the game with a wooden board and round pieces. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game to the USA from Quebec, Canada, where it was popular in his family. The family played the game every weekend and holiday, and visitors loved it because it was unknown in the southern USA.
Dave decided to make a new board three years ago, and people loved it. They asked him to make more, and soon the brothers were selling them at markets and craft fairs. The game became very popular, and they even started a championship with a trophy called the Lord Pichenotte Cup. Now, the brothers make pichenotte boards in their garage and sell them online for $595 each.
The game is played with 12 pieces or 'pucks' that you flick across a wheel-like board using your fingers. The goal is to get your pucks into small holes or around the edges of the board. It's a game of skill that can be played by two to four people. The brothers hope to make a fortune from their game and are happy to spend their free time playing it.

'Welcome to the Model Village! Just a few years ago, this was a piece of waste land. But one man, with the help of his wife, turned it into this beautiful place. They moved many tons of soil and clay to create the hills and valleys you see today. It was a lot of hard work! They also planted many trees and flowers, choosing ones that can live in this windy and salty area near the sea.
The models in the village were made by one person, Colin Sims. He made over 100 models over nine years. They are made from different materials like stone, wood, and plastic, so they can withstand the weather. Colin had to learn how to make them, but he became an expert.
You will notice that everything is very detailed and looks very real. This is because Colin was very patient and developed special techniques to make the models. The Model Village is very popular and people come from all over to see it. The techniques used here have even been used in other model villages and in colleges.
As you walk around the village, you will see many different buildings, including a castle, a church, and a zoo. You can also play mini golf! Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models. You can take photos from the paths, but not too close. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.
We would love to hear your thoughts about the village. Are there any models that you think need to be improved? We are always planning new models and want to know what you think. We hope you enjoy your visit and will come back again soon.'

""Every week, British newspapers print pictures that invade people's privacy and break their own rules. Although some famous people agree to be photographed by paparazzi, this is not normal. Usually, people in the public eye suffer when their private moments are published on the front page. However, very few of them ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization that is supposed to deal with these kinds of issues. Rarely, if ever, do these pictures serve the public interest. Do pictures of famous people help catch criminals? How did a famous actress's picture on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain. But she didn't take any action. The PCC didn't even investigate this case. This is a scandal. 
The PCC should also look into another recent story about a famous pop star's private life. The pop star, like the actress, hasn't made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the initiative on this and other cases? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would probably lead to many newspapers being punished. The public would not support them, and editors would have to stop publishing this kind of material. Even photographers would be affected, as they would no longer be able to earn a living by taking pictures of celebrities. 
However, there are some problems with this idea. How would the PCC decide whether to investigate a case? Should it ask the person involved to make a complaint? And if they refuse, should it still investigate? There are also practical difficulties. The PCC would have to monitor all British newspapers, which would be a huge task. Additionally, celebrities and royalty might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and then be upset if it wasn't. 
The main problem is that the role of the PCC is too big. It would be difficult for them to handle all the complaints. There is also the embarrassment factor to consider. Even if someone's privacy has been invaded, they might not want to go through the embarrassment of an investigation. Most people just want to move on with their lives. A few might have other reasons for staying quiet. They might be worried that a worse story about them could come out if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. One comedian was also a victim of the press when his honeymoon pictures were published. He didn't complain then or later when his family was photographed on holiday. His reason was fear that the newspaper would use the pictures again with a new story, saying he was angry, and that, as a comedian, they thought he would find it funny. This fear is understandable. People think they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It's hard to see an easy solution to this serious problem."""

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at the B1 level (CEFR):
I visited Malaysia for a kite-flying festival. Adnan Ali, a local, gave me a kite when its string broke. He said it's a tradition: if you find a broken kite, you keep it. He showed me many more kites he had made. We sat under some trees and watched the festival. There were 10 platforms with helpers holding up kites, and many people waiting to let their kites fly. The festival happens every year for five days. The kites are judged on how they look, how stable they are in the air, and how well they fly.
Adnan invited me to his home to learn how to make kites. I accepted and had tea and snacks with him. He told me to come back the next day to help him make a new kite, but I didn't have time. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state and drove to Kuala Lumpur. I took a wrong turn and ended up at a river. A small boat took me across, and I saw a sign pointing to a forest. I decided to go in and found a man named Baba, who was running a small camp. I stayed there for the night, even though I was a bit scared of the insects.
The next morning, I woke up to a beautiful view of the mountains. It started raining in the afternoon, and I got wet. I was worried about my car, but it was still there when I got back. In the town, everyone was very friendly and asked me questions like ""Where are you from?"" and ""How old are you?"" I remember my trip more for the kindness of the people than the kites.
