**Title:** Charging for Trash
**Text:**
In many countries, people throw away a lot of trash. Some people think it's a good idea to charge families for the trash they throw away. This way, people might think twice before throwing things away and might recycle more. But is it really a good idea?
In some towns, people are already charged for their trash. They get stickers or tags to put on their trash bags. Only trash with the sticker is picked up. In one town, people were charged 80 cents for each sticker. This might seem like a good idea, but it didn't work as well as expected.
People didn't buy more stickers, so they just put more trash in each bag. This means that the trash didn't get smaller, but it got heavier. Some people even started dumping their trash in other places instead of paying for it.
The only good thing that happened was that people started recycling a bit more. But it's not clear if the fee had anything to do with this. Maybe people were already recycling before the fee was introduced.
The results of charging for trash are not as simple as we thought. It's not just about charging a fee, but also about many other things, like how much money people have and how educated they are. Richer towns throw away more trash than poorer towns, and people in richer towns have less time to recycle.
So, is charging for trash a good idea? It might not be the best solution. But it's also important to remember that throwing away trash for free is not a good idea either. We need to think carefully about how to make things work better.
**Questions:**
1. Why do some people think it's a good idea to charge families for the trash they throw away?
2. What happened in one town where people were charged for their trash?
3. What did people do instead of buying more stickers for their trash bags?
4. What did people start doing a bit more after the fee was introduced?
5. Why do richer towns throw away more trash than poorer towns?

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for learners of English at the A2 level:
Work and life are not the same as they used to be. Many people are not happy with their jobs. They feel that their work does not make them fulfilled or respected. Some people are even unhappy with their careers, despite being successful. They feel that their work is not valued or understood.
In the past, loving your work was enough to make you happy. But now, people want more. They want to know how their work affects their personal lives, relationships, and minds. They want to know if their work makes them a better person.
To achieve this, we need to rethink what work means. Work should not just be a way to make money, but a way to live a fulfilling life. It should be a path to discover new talents, make new friends, and learn new things.
However, this is not an easy task. Many people are unhappy with their jobs because they are not valued or respected. They feel like they are just machines, not people. Some people even feel like they are slaves to their jobs.
For example, hotel workers are often overworked and underpaid. They are not valued for their skills or talents. They are just seen as machines that serve guests. But hotels could be so much more. They could be places where people from different cultures come together and learn from each other.
To achieve this, we need to rethink what work means. We need to value people, not just their skills or jobs. We need to give people the chance to design their own jobs and work with people they like. We need to learn how to communicate with each other in a way that is respectful and meaningful.
This is not just about work, it's about life. It's about being happy and fulfilled. It's about being a human being."

""BROADCASTING: How Technology Was Shaped by Society
A long time ago, 'broadcasting' meant spreading seeds far and wide. This is not just a farming metaphor, but also a symbol of modern optimism. It's about planned growth, spreading to many people, and producing a good harvest. The idea of broadcasting assumes that there is a central place where resources are gathered and distributed to others.
The question is, why did a new technology that sends words and pictures through the airwaves become organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor? Since television was related to other two-way communication methods, like the telephone and telegraph, it's surprising that it was designed as a centralized medium. However, sending information to private homes from a central location fit with the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some experiments with alternative ways of organizing television, but they didn't succeed. For example, in the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to use television as a two-way communication tool, like a telephone. But big businesses and governments decided on standards for television equipment and channels, which stopped these grassroots efforts.
Television was also used as a way to show movies and plays in public places, especially in the United States. In many countries, people watched TV in public places, not just at home. This was true in Britain and Germany, for example.
The idea of a decentralized, two-way television system was not successful, but there were some TV systems that allowed people to watch together in public. However, manufacturers wanted to sell TV sets to individual homes, and people wanted to have entertainment and cultural experiences in their own homes.
As people's living standards improved and they entered the consumer society, they wanted to have more entertainment and cultural experiences at home. This is still happening today, on a global scale. There is a connection between the process of modernization and the way broadcasting works.
Centralized broadcasting was a way for governments to reach many people with important information and to create a sense of national identity. The dominance of centralized broadcasting came from the interests of big business and governments.
What is missing from this story is the idea that broadcasting could also be a way to promote democracy and equal access to information. In the past, broadcasting policies were influenced by the idea of equal access to resources for informed and autonomous participation in society.""

'Clutter Sometimes we feel like we need more things to feel safe. But having too many things can make us feel anxious. Advertisers try to make us feel like we need more things. They tell us that if we don't have something, we are not good enough. We see these messages everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the internet. They want us to buy, buy, buy.
Caves are interesting places that people have studied for a long time. They want to know where they come from, how they are formed, and what lives in them. People have been studying caves for a long time because they are a part of nature. Some people like to visit caves for fun, and they also help scientists learn more about them.
Weather forecasting has a long history. People used to watch the sky and feel the wind to predict the weather. Now we have special machines that help us know what the weather will be like. Computers can do complicated math problems fast, but people are still important for making weather forecasts. They help us understand what the weather means and make good predictions.'

'Music and Theatre
I used to think that opera is mainly about theatre. But now I know that music is the most important part. When I worked at an opera house, I learned that the music comes first. That's the way it should be.
I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actor speaking them are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the show starts, and the performers and the audience mostly speak the same language.
When people go to a concert or an opera, some of them might not know much about music. They might feel a bit embarrassed or amazed by how good the performers are. A great singer or musician is like an athlete - they work very hard to be good.
Theatre audiences are different. They don't always understand how hard actors work, and they might not be impressed by a long and difficult speech. But that doesn't mean they are not good audience members. They just have different expectations.
The question is, can music learn from theatre? I think so. I've seen how a different approach can make the concert-going experience better. Music is like theatre - it's full of passion, humor, and emotion. But music often feels too formal, like there's a big difference between the performers and the audience.
I think music could learn from theatre's way of making the audience feel more equal to the performers. I've seen some great examples of this, like a community opera that took place in a cathedral and then went out into the town. It was amazing, and many people in the audience felt like they were a part of it.
I wish music could be more like theatre - a bit more daring and exciting. Sometimes, music can be put on in unusual places, which can be really powerful. I love both music and theatre, and I want them to be popular and enjoyable for everyone.'

Many people want to feel safe and secure in their homes. This is why we have locks and keys. Even though we have new technology, people still like the feeling of turning a key to lock a door. 
I was worried about visiting a modern art museum because I don't understand most of it. I like some modern art, like sculptures and big photos. But I don't know much about it. The new museum I visited tried to explain the art to me. They had labels that told me what the art was about. This helped me understand it better.'

**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Making a movie from a book is a difficult task. The writer has to choose what to keep and what to leave out. This can be frustrating, but it's also interesting. I was surprised to see how much of the dialogue and description in a scene could be removed while still keeping the same message.
In a book, we need more information to understand the characters and what's happening. In a movie, we can get the same message with less information. This is because movies and books use different ways to communicate.
**Watching Movies**
Watching a movie is a special experience. It can take us away from our everyday life and make us feel like we're part of the story. But when the movie ends, we go back to reality. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent watching the movie.
Some people used to think that movies were just entertainment and not a serious art form. But many people now consider movies to be an art form.
**The Film Studios**
The film studios where movies are made can be confusing. The buildings are not well-organized, and it's hard to find your way around. The people who work there know the studios well, but it's hard for strangers to navigate.
The studios are where romance and adventure come to life. People go there to escape their daily problems and have a good time.
**Film-Makers**
Many people want to make movies. There are books and courses to help them learn how to do it. Some people even make movies with small budgets and become famous. One director, Robert Rodriguez, made a movie for just $7,000 and became a well-known director.
In the past, movie directors took time to learn their craft. They started by working behind the scenes and made their breakthrough films later in life. Now, with the help of technology, aspiring directors can make their own movies and become famous quickly."

""In the past, there were many houses in a row on one side of the city. They were made of orange brick or white stucco and looked a bit old. In the summer, a strong smell from a factory two miles away would come and make the air smell bad. People would often complain about this smell.
I don't remember much about my childhood, but I do remember sitting on a windowsill and looking at the houses going away into the distance. My mother was a small, strict woman who always seemed angry. I didn't understand why she was angry, and I couldn't make her happy.
My mother was a very private person who liked things to be proper. She would get angry if I didn't behave correctly. She would say things like 'behave properly' and 'don't touch that'. She was very particular about things like not going into other people's gardens and not touching their flowers.
As I grew up, I met some other people who were friends with my mother. They would talk about things like the royal family and the weather. My mother didn't like these people very much, and I didn't like them either.
When I was young, I used to play at home and then go to school when I was five. My mother would take me on the bus to the museum on Sundays. We would look at paintings and my mother would say things like 'I wouldn't like to meet that soldier on a dark night!' This was the only time I remember my mother trying to be funny.""

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The sun was setting, and the air was wet and cool. I knew this street from when I was a child. There were many houses, and each one was special to me. The houses on this street were not as fancy as the ones on other streets. They had small porches and small front yards. Over time, some of the houses that used to be homes became stores. It was strange to see stores become homes again.
I visited a friend who lived in a big, open space that used to be a curtain warehouse. He wanted to make the space feel more cozy, so he put up a big, wavy plastic sheet to divide the room. He also added a kitchen and some furniture that his parents gave him. He likes to cook and work in this space.
There was a famous writer named Bruce Chatwin who loved to travel. He wrote a book called ""In Patagonia"" that is very imaginative and exciting. He mixed fact and fiction to make his stories more interesting.
I like to swim in my pool when it rains. The rain makes the water splash and creates bubbles. I used to swim in the pool every day, but I wanted to do something new. I decided to swim through Britain to the sea. I wanted to explore and find new places.
Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But sometimes I like to walk, bike, or swim to find things on my own and discover new things. It's fun to get off the beaten path and explore the unknown.

'Charles Darwin thought that crying didn't have a clear reason to exist. But scientists now think it's important for people to cry. A doctor named John Bowlby said that crying helps mothers and children bond. Some people believe that crying is a way to show when we're helpless. But it's harder to understand why adults still cry. It might be that the sound of crying isn't as important as the way it looks. Crying could have helped early human groups feel more connected and trust each other. We might cry to show sympathy for people who are suffering. We can also cry because we're moved by music, speeches, or movies. Interestingly, we're more likely to cry when we're with others. It seems that crying helps us connect with others, but scientists are still studying this.'

'The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. We know it's happening, but we're not sure what will happen next. A warmer world will change the weather everywhere. This will affect plants, animals, and the air we breathe. We use the natural resources of the Earth to live, and any changes to these resources are important.
Scientists have found that human activities have increased the amount of certain gases in the air, which makes the Earth warmer. They think this will continue to happen in the future. The Earth has warmed by 6°C over the past 100 years. Most scientists think this is not natural and is partly because of human pollution.
Scientists use computers to predict what will happen in the future. They use these computers to study the Earth's climate. The predictions are not exact, but they can give us an idea of what might happen. The predictions say that the Earth will get warmer, and this will cause problems. For example, some places will get more rain, while others will get less. This could cause floods, droughts, and heatwaves.
The changes in the climate will also affect the natural environment. This could be good or bad. For example, some places might get more food, but others might get less water. The consequences of climate change could be very serious. Many people might have to leave their homes and find new places to live. This could happen in small island countries, where the whole country might disappear if the sea level rises too much.
We need to be careful and take action to reduce the effects of global warming. We can do this by reducing pollution and using natural resources wisely.'

'Art and Beauty
It's strange that the things we use to learn about art can actually make it harder to understand. This is because art is often seen as something separate from our everyday lives. We think of a work of art as a painting, a book, or a statue, but it's not just these physical things that are important - it's what they do to us and how they make us feel.
Some art is very good and famous, but this can make it hard to see it in a new way. When something is very famous, it can become isolated from the people and events that created it. This makes it harder to understand its true meaning.
The goal of thinking about art is to connect it to our everyday experiences. We need to see how art is connected to the things we do and feel every day.
Just like geographers and geologists study the earth, we need to study the things that make art work. To do this, we need to look at the ordinary things that make art beautiful, like the way a sunset looks or the sound of music.
We can enjoy art without knowing much about it, but to really understand it, we need to look at the things that make it beautiful. We need to start with the simple things that make us happy and interested.
Many people enjoy things that are not considered ""art"" by some people, like movies, music, or comic strips. This is because they find beauty in the things they do every day.
The problem is that many people separate art from their everyday lives. They think that art is only for special occasions, like visiting a museum. But art is all around us, and it's connected to the things we do every day.'

Lions are often seen as great hunters. They work together to catch their prey. They are very good at hiding and surprising their food. But after studying lions for many years, we have a different view. We thought that lions would help each other because it would be good for them. But sometimes, when one lion helps another, it can actually harm itself. So, why do lions still work together? We thought we would find the answer quickly, but lions are very good at doing nothing. It took a long time to learn more about their behavior.
**Pop Music Review**
The band Bedrock released a new album called New Life. It was a big success and changed the way rock music was made in this country. The album was different from others because it was happy and used instruments like fairground organs and brass bands.

It is a great example of a band that is very good at making music.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
The writer was always interested in stories about wise women from ancient times. One story told about a woman who was very good at selling books. She offered a king nine books for a lot of money, but he refused. She then burned three of the books and offered the rest for the same price. The king refused again, and she burned three more books. Finally, he bought the last three books for the full price. The writer learned an important lesson from this story about salesmanship and life.
**What Happens to a Manuscript**
When you send a book to a publisher, it usually goes to a big pile of manuscripts waiting to be read. A young editor or an experienced editor reads the manuscript. If they like it, they pass it on to a more senior editor. The senior editor decides whether to accept the book or not. The editor also thinks about whether the author is good at writing and whether the book will sell well.

**Advertising in a Difficult Time**
In the early 1990s, the advertising industry was very challenging. Many companies were losing money, and people were losing their jobs. In Britain, for example, many people lost their jobs, and some 75,000 homes were repossessed. Every business was affected, and some industries like the car and building trades were 30% down.
Advertising people were under a lot of pressure. They had to do their jobs with smaller budgets and were asked to produce good work with less money. They felt like they were under close scrutiny from their bosses and colleagues. At the same time, companies were starting to realize the importance of marketing. They wanted to make sure they were producing products that people wanted, not just what was easy for them to make.
The advertising industry was under a lot of pressure. Many companies were reviewing their advertising budgets and wondering if they were getting a good return on their investment. They wanted to see better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better media placement. They wanted the best people working on their business and wanted them to work hard to produce good work.
Advertising people were facing many challenges. They had to do more with less, and there were many other factors making it difficult to produce effective advertising. These included demographic changes, the power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and legal restrictions on advertising.
The pressure was on to make sure that more of the advertising worked. It was not surprising that there was not much help available for those who wanted to improve their advertising. Companies were too busy coping with the difficult circumstances, and those who were successful were keeping their secrets to themselves.

**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. Most of my friends didn't think it was a good choice. Cooking is hard work and not very well paid. But I didn't care. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult and the social life was boring. Being a chef seemed like a good way to escape all that. It would be a serious and honest job. My decision wasn't just because I was unhappy at university. I also loved the idea of cooking. I had my first taste of this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing! I still remember my starter. After that, I wanted to learn how to cook. I spent all my free time reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and cooking big meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
I went to swimming lessons at school. The instructor was a former army sergeant. He was small and strong, with tattoos on his arms. He taught me how to dive. First, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. Then, he got me to stand up and dive off the edge. He was very strict and told me to look up, not down, and to keep my legs straight.
**The Traveller**
Some people love to travel and take risks. They climb high mountains, sail across the sea, and live in the wilderness. We might think they're strange, but they're not crazy. They just have a different idea of what's important. They're willing to take risks to experience new things. We can't understand their world, but it's interesting to learn about it.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who loves to sail. He's not a great sailor, but he likes to write about his sailing adventures. He uses a special device to find his way on the sea. He thinks the invention of the compass was a mistake. It took away the connection between people and the sea. Now, sailors just look at the compass instead of the waves.

Summer is a great time to go on holiday and read books. Reading can help us feel more at home in the world. We can find books that talk about things that happen to us, and we can relate to them. Authors can write about things that we think and feel, but they can express them in a way that is clear and accurate. This makes us feel happy and grateful.
When we travel, we can escape the routine of our daily lives. Our eyes are open to new things, and we notice things we wouldn't have noticed before. We can read books that help us see the world in a new way.

'Music - The Future
Music is an important part of our lives. Technology is changing the way we listen to music and how we make music. In the past, we had more opportunities to listen to music on the radio, TV, records, and CDs. At the same time, there were fewer jobs for professional musicians and less live music performances.
In the future, we will probably have even more ways to listen to music. People will have different musical tastes and preferences. Technology will also help people make music, but it might also make it harder for musicians who only play live music.
Playing a musical instrument is important for many reasons. It can help people develop skills that are useful in many jobs. It can also help children develop their spatial reasoning and social skills. Some research suggests that playing an instrument can even help people focus and learn better.
In the future, there will be more opportunities for people to learn to play instruments. This means that music teachers will need to adapt their teaching methods to include more people of all ages. Musicians will need to learn how to teach and work with different groups of people.
It's important to make music more popular and valued in our society. People involved in music education need to work together to show that music is important and valuable. We need to make music a bigger part of our lives.'

Actors are often criticized, but they should not talk about their work too much. When they do, they often use boring phrases or talk about themselves too much. A famous actor named Pavlova said that if she could explain her dancing, she wouldn't do it. Actors should focus on their work, not on talking about it.
The actor Paul Scofield said that an actor's work is only interesting when they do it. When they talk about it, it becomes boring and empty. Every time an actor works on a new play, they start from scratch and learn something new.
Adrian Lester played Hamlet very well. He was both funny and serious at the same time. His performance was very good and showed his confidence as an actor.
What is acting? Is it imitating someone or bringing someone to life? Who or what makes actors' bodies move? These are important questions about the life of the theatre.
One director has a special way of working with actors. He calls it ""dropping in"". He shows them the script and they think about what it means to them. They find the reason to speak and then speak. This way, they can discover new things about their characters.
The perfect theatre is one that makes you feel like you're part of the show. The staff should feel like they're part of it too. The theatre should create a connection between the performers and the audience. The auditorium should be designed to make the audience feel close to the stage.
It's impossible to make a play that everyone will like. You can't guess what people will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and exciting."

'Two days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and acting like a dinosaur. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he didn't know much. Some people think that learning from computers and TV is a good way to learn, but is it really? One man tried an interactive game with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. 'If he had read a book for ten minutes, he might have learned something,' said the father. Television is like a storybook, but it's not the same as learning with a teacher or parent. We can use new technology to teach our children, but we still need schools.

Some years ago, a website warned people about sharing their whereabouts online. The site said that when you share your location, you are also sharing it with many people you don't know, not all of whom you might like to meet. This made people think about the risks of sharing too much online.
The internet has made it easy for people to share many things about themselves, like photos and stories. Some people think this is exciting, as it can bring wealth and fame. However, many people have learned the hard way that sharing too much online can be dangerous.
In the early days of the internet, a group of brave people, known as bloggers, shared their lives online. They faced many challenges, such as losing friends and getting into trouble. These bloggers have already experienced what many of us are now doing online.
Before we share too much online, it's a good idea to learn from their experiences. In the 1990s, a student named Justin Hall started a blog and shared his life with the world. He wrote about everything, including his relationships and personal struggles. However, he had to take his blog down because it affected his relationships.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, shared her life online and lost her job because of it. She learned that what we share online can affect our real lives. Armstrong eventually restarted her blog and became a successful ""mommy blogger"".
The article suggests that we should be careful about what we share online and remember that just because we can say something online, it doesn't mean we should."

**Sleep: A Modern Problem**
Many people have a problem with sleep. They are tired and anxious. This is because they are busy and have too much to do. In the USA, 40 million people have this problem.
**Sleep Research**
Scientists are studying sleep to understand why people have trouble sleeping. They want to know how to help people sleep better. One scientist did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. The results showed that people need more sleep.
**The University Sleep Research Laboratory**
In England, there is a laboratory that studies sleep. They test people's sleep and wakefulness. They want to know how sleep affects people's daily lives. The laboratory has a special room that simulates a motorway. They test people's driving skills after they have not slept or only slept a little.
**What Do We Know About Sleep?**
We know that humans sleep in a cycle. We switch between different stages of sleep. When we dream, our brain paralyses our body so we don't hurt ourselves. But we don't know exactly why we sleep. Some scientists think that sleep helps our bodies repair themselves, but this is not certain.
**Women Sleep Longer Than Men**
Scientists know that women sleep for about half an hour longer than men. They also know that older people need less sleep. But they don't know why.
**Sleep in the Past**
In the past, people slept differently. They would go to bed early and wake up after midnight. They would stay awake for a while and then go back to sleep. This was a time for reflection and relaxation. With the invention of artificial light, people started sleeping more solidly at night.
**Sleep Around the World**
In some parts of the world, people still don't sleep solidly at night. They go to bed for a few hours and then get up again. This is because they need to watch out for predators and take care of their animals. It seems that people all over the world need more sleep."

Vancouver, in western Canada, has become a popular place for people from all over the world to live. Many people move there because of its good weather, beautiful surroundings, and safe and clean environment. The city is also a good place to find a job or go to school.
In the evenings, people like to walk around the city and enjoy the atmosphere. You might hear different languages being spoken as you walk. The city is changing quickly, with new buildings going up all the time. This has brought new life to the city and made it a popular place for tourists to visit.
Vancouver used to be called ""Terminal City"" because it was a stop for people traveling to other places. Now, it's still a gateway, but for many people, it's also a place to call home.
Journalists are not good at writing letters. This is because we always try to make our writing interesting, so we don't have time to think about how our words will be received. Artists, on the other hand, don't think about how their work will be received. They just create because they want to.
The opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. Famous people would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets are opening all the time, so it's not necessary to have a famous person to open it.

He said that he was not sure what he was allowed to do, so he just did it. He had a great team working with him. The film is about a rich man who owns a newspaper. Welles thought it was a great chance for him to be both the director and the actor.

I went to Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. It's my job. I like the way light falls on things. I like how one picture can show what a place, a person, or a moment is like. One day, I might take the perfect picture. I always carry my camera with me. I went to Vienna because another photographer, Rudi, quit. The publishers wanted me to finish his job. I was free and they liked my pictures. I stayed at the Europa hotel in the city center. I had been to Vienna before, but it was hot and busy. This time, it was cold and quiet. I wanted to take some good pictures. The first day, I just walked around and looked at the city. The weather was cold and grey, like the old buildings. I didn't know what Rudi had done before, and I didn't care. This was my Vienna, and I wanted to show it in my pictures. I waited and looked until I could see clearly. Then I was ready to take some pictures. The next morning, I went out early. The snow had fallen overnight, and the square in front of the cathedral was empty and white. I wanted to take a picture of the cathedral, but it was hard. It's big and squat, and its spire goes up high into the sky. I couldn't take it all in one shot, so I took a partial picture. It was still beautiful in the early morning light. Taking pictures is like magic. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a picture. It's still a mystery, even when you know how it works. That's why what happened at the cathedral that morning didn't surprise me.

""The Hayward Gallery in London has changed. Instead of big, flashy exhibitions, it now shows a special kind of art called kinetic art. This art moves or is about movement. The curator, Guy Brett, has collected many examples of kinetic art from the last 60 years. The exhibition is not explained in words. Visitors can look and discover for themselves.
Some people like art because it's easy to understand. They might like the subject matter or the artist's personality. But does that mean the art is not good? Some critics think the artist, David Hockney, is not important. But he knows his limitations and doesn't mind if people don't think he's a great artist.
I, as a curator, wanted to do something different. I invited seven artists to show their work in an empty warehouse. Each artist did something different, like making knitted cats or showing a broken video camera. They didn't fit together, but that's okay. The contrast between them made them interesting.
Some people think that understanding art is bad because it spoils the pleasure of looking at it. But knowing more about the art can actually make it more enjoyable. We can enjoy something without knowing all about it, but knowing more can make it more interesting. How we enjoy something is also influenced by our society and the values we have.""

'Metals
A long time ago, people might have started using metals because they liked the way they looked. They might have found a shiny yellow stone by a river and picked it up. This could be how people first discovered gold. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so people liked it a lot. They might have also found copper by accident. When they realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for more copper and ways to get it out of the ground. This is how people learned to work with metals.
St Ives
We walked down a winding street in St Ives, trying to avoid the strong wind and the big waves on the beach. There were no people on the street, and all the shutters on the houses were closed. We had taken a small train to get to St Ives, and the weather was getting worse. I had promised my friend that we would have a nice time walking on the beach and sitting by the fire. But now it didn't seem like such a good idea.
Computer Modelling
It's hard to learn about the past because it's gone. The people who lived a long time ago are dead, and we can't talk to them. Archaeologists find clues, but we can't test our ideas with people who are alive or dead. But we can use computers to create a fake world and people to live in it. We can make rules for them and see how they behave. We can even change the weather or the number of people and see how they react.'

**Vervet Monkeys**
A long time ago, some scientists were studying vervet monkeys. They saw a strange monkey coming to visit their group. The strange monkey wanted to join the group, but the leader of the group didn't want to lose his position. So, the leader came up with a clever idea. When the stranger came close, he made a loud noise to scare him away. The stranger went back to his own trees. This happened several times. But one day, the leader made a mistake. He made the noise again, but this time he was walking in the open. The stranger didn't get scared and came closer.
**Cats**
Some people in a village in England counted how many animals their cats caught in one year. They caught over 1,000 animals! A professor thought this meant that all the cats in Britain catch 100 million animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and don't catch as many animals as the cats in the village. The important question is: can the number of animals caught by cats be sustained? The answer is yes. Many people feed birds in the winter, and birds have places to live, so the bird population stays high.
**Buffaloes**
In some places, buffaloes are very important. They help people who live near the water. Every morning, the buffaloes slowly walk to the water and spend the day eating plants and resting. They are very slow and quiet, and it seems like they are almost asleep. They spend the day grazing and resting in the water.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at the A2 level (CEFR):
""Photography has been used to capture many moments of human life and activity for over 150 years. It has helped us see things that are very small or very far away, like the world and the universe. Photography has also shown us the social and cultural changes in the world. The idea that'seeing is believing' makes the visual image very important. When photography was invented, it was seen as a way to get a true and honest picture of the world.
At first, people thought that photography was like the human eye, capturing what we see. They thought that anyone could understand a photograph, no matter where they came from. But as we have more global communication, we need to ask if photography can really cross cultural boundaries. Is it possible that our familiarity with photographs makes us forget how they are made and what they mean?
Photography has changed a lot since it was invented in 1839. It used to be a way to record everyday life, but now it's more about capturing big events and historical moments. Photographs can tell us a lot about the people who took them and the society they lived in. I believe that photography is not just a way to record what happens, but it can also inspire change and progress. For example, the way we take pictures today has changed the way we think and communicate. It's hard to imagine the Renaissance without the development of perspective, and photography has played a big role in shaping our modern media culture.""

**How to Write Poetry and Other Forms of Writing**
Writing is like walking through a minefield. You need to be careful and spontaneous. If you make a mistake, it can be difficult to fix. Some people write poetry because they are happy, while others write because they are sad. Some people write at a specific time, while others wait for inspiration.
The most important thing is to find your own way of writing. Don't follow rules or copy others. Listen to your own voice and let your imagination run free. Write as much as you can and read a lot.
**Writing Short Stories**
A short story should not have too many characters or long descriptions. It should be concise and to the point. Flashbacks should be brief and only used to help the story make sense. Dialogue is a good way to show two different opinions at the same time.
**Writing Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves. You don't need to know everything, but you need to understand the big picture. The more you write, the better you will become at it.
**The Art of Writing**
Writing is a human instinct, but written language is not. Children learn language naturally, but writing is something that needs to be taught. Writing systems have been invented only a few times in history, and they are not easy to learn. Children need to understand how writing works and how their minds work in order to write well.

I'm not sure if I should write this book. It's not a story with a beginning, middle, and end. There's no big event or important decision. I just want to write about a man I knew a little bit. I don't know much about what happened to him between our meetings. I could make things up to make the story more interesting, but I don't want to do that. I just want to tell what I know.
I've changed the names of the people in the story to protect their privacy. The man I'm writing about is not famous and might not be remembered after he dies. But maybe his way of living and his kind heart will have an effect on other people, and they will remember him long after he's gone.
I didn't record our conversations exactly, but I have a good memory and I think I've written them down truthfully. I've also added some things that I didn't hear, but I think they sound like things he might have said. I did this to make the story more interesting and believable.
I'm a little worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from another country because you can't experience everything they have experienced. You can only know someone if you are them. I've never written about people from another country before, and I'm not sure if I can make them seem real.

'POETRY RECITALS
In the past, people thought the world of poetry was confusing. But looking back, we can see that there were clear patterns and famous poets. Today, it's hard to understand the many different kinds of poetry being written and performed. There are many different opinions about what poetry should be and how it should be presented.
Some poets write for the page and want people to read their work in books. Others write for performances and like to read their poems to an audience. These two groups don't always agree. Some people think that poets who write for performances are not as good as those who write for the page.
In the past 20 years, there has been a big increase in poetry readings. Small groups, schools, and festivals invite poets to read their work to an audience. This is a good way for people to enjoy poetry and learn about it. Poets who write for performances like this kind of attention. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand.
Poets who write for the page might not be as happy with this kind of attention. Their poems are often more complex and need to be read carefully. It's better for people to read poetry on the page and then hear it read aloud. This way, they can understand it better.
The main reason for poetry readings is to make people enjoy poetry and think it's fun. It's not just for a special group of people who understand poetry.'

**Oral History**
Some historians use oral evidence to learn about the past. But it's not always easy. When someone tells their story, they are affected by the person asking the questions and the way they think about the past. The person asking the questions can also influence what they say. Even if the person asking the questions doesn't ask any questions, just being there can change how the person remembers and talks about the past.
When we look at someone's memories, we have to remember that they might not be completely true. They might have learned things from other people or the media, or they might remember things differently because of how they feel about them.
**Animal Science**
There are two ways to study animals. Some scientists look at how animals' bodies work, like how their nerves and muscles work together. Others study animals in their natural habitats and how they behave.
There are different types of scientists who study animals. Some study how animals learn and behave in labs. Others study how animals behave in the wild. Both types of scientists are important, and they can learn from each other.
**The Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you have to learn two things at the same time. You have to learn about the subject and how to study it. It's like learning a new language - you have to learn the words and the rules.
Social sciences are not just common sense. Each subject has its own special way of studying and thinking about people and society.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was an art that included things like order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and propriety.
The ancient Greeks and Romans didn't just build buildings for practical use. They built them to be beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The idea of architecture as an art has been around for a long time, even if the way we build things has changed.

'Online Book Reviews: A New Way to Share Opinions
The internet was meant to be a place where anyone could share their thoughts and ideas. This idea was especially true for book reviews. Amazon, a popular online bookshop, made it easy for anyone to write a review of a book. Anyone could say what they liked or didn't like about a book and give it 1 to 5 stars.
At first, this seemed like a great idea. People could read reviews from other readers to help them decide if they wanted to buy a book. But soon, some people started to misuse this system. They would write fake reviews to make their own books look better or to make other books look bad. Some authors even wrote fake reviews themselves!
Amazon tried to stop this from happening by having a team of editors check the reviews. They made sure that reviews were not too short or too mean. But it was hard to catch all the fake reviews. One author, Lev Grossman, wrote fake reviews to balance out the negative reviews of his own book. He got caught and the fake reviews were removed.
Some authors were allowed to write comments on their own books, but Amazon didn't check if they were really the authors. One fake comment was from a famous author, John Updike, saying he was overhyped. Amazon removed it.
The real problem was with readers who wrote mean reviews about books. When a book was not well received, many people wrote negative reviews. But sometimes these reviews would be removed. Amazon wanted to keep the reviews as a place for people to talk about books, not a place for arguments.
Despite the problems, many people loved writing and reading reviews. They took it very seriously and helped each other decide which books were worth buying. In fact, the reviews were often very accurate and helped people make good choices. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing books was hard because you had to pretend to like or dislike books you didn't really care about. But with online reviews, anyone could share their real opinions and help others.'"

Art is important. We like to think that every artist is special and does something new and exciting. We admire artists who did things that no one liked 100 years ago. But when we look at art today, we often say it's not good or that it's not art. We expect art to be new and different, so we don't notice the good things about it.
We like to think that artists are special people who can do things that others can't. We expect them to be good and talented. In the past, people asked artists to create things for specific purposes. Today, we leave artists alone and get upset if they try to do something different.
Let's imagine a situation. An artist chooses a text that talks about different kinds of pictures. The artist then asks someone to write this text on a canvas. The person writes the text in simple black letters on a white canvas. My question is: is this a painting?
Artists often have to follow the same style to be successful. They get commissions to create specific types of art. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have been successful by doing something different. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something new. He is showing his art at the Mercury Gallery in London.
In this gallery, you can see 40 paintings and drawings that show the magic of the London Underground. The artist, Eric Rimmington, likes trains and has been drawing them for a long time.

Heritage is important because it helps us feel connected to the past. We learn about our family history and the history of our country. This helps us understand our future.

A reviewer must be able to write clearly and concisely, and also think about the audience reading the review.
The length of a review is important. It can be short and simple or long and detailed. The reviewer must consider who will be reading the review and what they want to know. A reviewer must also be knowledgeable about many things and be able to write in a way that is easy to understand.
Many people who write reviews also write other things. The American writer John Updike writes novels and also reviews books. He collects his reviews and publishes them in books. Some people think that reviewers should not keep their reviews, but it is nice to have a record of their work.
I am an academic and I write reviews. I think it's good that academics can also write reviews because it helps them stay connected to the outside world. It also reminds them to write clearly and simply, not just for other academics. Writing reviews is a secondary job, but it's an important one.""

Ralph opened the door to his flat and felt a little strange. It was a feeling he got sometimes when he came home alone after work. When he first bought the flat, he used to come home excited and curious, wondering what it had been like while he was away. He thought it was like a special place where he could be himself.
The flat was always the same when he came home. If he left it tidy, it looked neat and clean. If he left it messy, it looked a bit neglected. Ralph started to think of it as a part of himself, a place where he could relax and be himself.
Sometimes, there were letters and messages waiting for him on the floor. He was glad that nothing was broken or damaged. He looked forward to his evenings at home, when he could be alone and do what he wanted.
Ralph often felt lonely at work, so he looked forward to coming home. He would sit alone in his flat, read, listen to music, or do whatever he liked. But sometimes he felt empty and unsure of himself. He wondered if he had changed too much and lost his sense of who he was.
Ralph had tried to make plans for his future, but he wasn't sure what he wanted. He took a job at a local newspaper, but it wasn't what he had hoped for. His boss, Neil, offered him the job, and Ralph was relieved. But now, he had to deal with daily meetings and tasks, which was overwhelming.

""Goat Racing
I went to a goat racing event on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, food stalls, and music. I had to push my way through the crowd to get a good spot. A special area was set up for the race. The goats were trying to stay in line, but they can eat almost anything they find. It was hard to keep them together.
Canoe Trip
As the day ended, I thought about the night ahead. We had to sleep in a canoe, but it was wet and we couldn't find a place to stop. We didn't see any villages or huts all day. At night, we could see the cliffs in the moonlight. We put new batteries in our torch, but it didn't work. We were worried about finding a place to camp. We kept moving. Later, Lesley saw a light in the distance, but it was just the moon shining on the water. We heard the sound of rushing water, but we couldn't see what was happening.

There are some things that cannot be rushed. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you're impatient and do something too quickly, it might not turn out right. The same is true for our minds. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can speed up some things, like solving a puzzle or doing math in our heads. But some things need time and cannot be rushed.
Our minds have different ways of working. Some things happen quickly, without us even thinking about it. For example, when we're driving a car, our body reacts quickly to danger without us needing to think about it. Other things take more time, like solving a problem or making a decision. We need to think carefully and weigh the pros and cons.
There's also a way of thinking that's slower and more relaxed. It's like daydreaming or thinking deeply about something. This way of thinking is important too. It helps us come up with new ideas and solve problems that are hard to understand.
Some scientists are studying how our minds work and are discovering that the slower ways of thinking are important for learning and solving complex problems. They're finding that our unconscious mind can do things that our conscious mind can't, like learn patterns and make sense of complicated situations.

They said it's not just because they want to learn new things, but they want to know why they want to learn. They think it's more important to make sure what they're doing is right than to worry about why they're doing it. I think the most important thing is to remember that science is a tool, and we should decide how and when to use it.'

Writing by hand is better than typing on a computer. Dr. Johnson, a famous writer, said that writing without effort is not enjoyable. I looked at my old school essays and saw that I didn't make many mistakes. This is because it was hard to write by hand. The slow pace of handwriting helps the brain think carefully. With a computer, it's easy to make mistakes and it's hard to correct them.
People used to write letters by hand, but now they send emails. This is good because it means people are writing more. However, emails can be sloppy and lack the care and thoughtfulness of handwritten letters.

Lancelot's secretary, a woman who knew him well, shouted to him, ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" She wasn't really asking a question, but stating a fact. She had been making him coffee for months. Lancelot usually came to work every day now, because he had found that if he didn't, things would get out of control. He used to be a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, but now he was just a busy person who had to deal with many tasks.
She put a folder in front of him and said, ""This came from Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The folder had a label that said ""A World History of the Short"" by Ian Cuthbert, with a subtitle ""An Expanded Synopsis"". Lancelot didn't want to see a synopsis. He had already read one and didn't want to see another one. Ian Cuthbert was an old friend who had been given a lot of money to write a book. Lancelot had made a mistake by commissioning the book, because Ian was not a reliable person.
Lancelot looked at the synopsis, but it was the same as the one he had read before. He closed the folder and put it aside. He thought that Ian would never finish writing the book. The synopsis was not good and didn't seem to be written with enthusiasm. Lancelot remembered a famous author who had written a book in pieces, one chapter at a time, but Ian had been given a lot of money upfront.

Birds have always been important in human culture. We love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? 
In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could tell them their luck. Today, wrens are still a popular image in British culture. We like to keep them in our homes and gardens. Without wrens, a wood or garden feels empty and sad.
Our relationship with birds goes back a long time. When people were more connected to nature, they developed a special language to talk about animals. This language is still important today, even though our ways of thinking have changed.
For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed it bread. But later, people started to see it as a pest, and it almost disappeared. Now, it's a protected bird and is being reintroduced to its natural habitat.
Birds are important to us because they remind us of our own nature. We are fascinated by their ability to fly, sing, and be free. Some people think that these feelings are old-fashioned and no longer relevant, but they are still part of who we are.
Birds are also a warning sign for the environment. When a species of bird is in danger, it's a sign that something is wrong with the environment. We need to protect birds and the natural world.
Folklore and stories about birds are important because they help us connect with the natural world. These stories are passed down through generations and are a way to understand and appreciate the world around us.
The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past. It's a mystery that we can't fully understand, but it's a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the natural world.

**Maps**
A map shows the connections between places and features on the Earth's surface. These connections are based on distance and direction. A long time ago, people used to measure distance in terms of time, like ""a day's journey"" or ""an hour's walk"". This didn't always give the exact distance, but it did show how easy or hard it was to travel through different areas.
Direction is also important, but for most people, knowing where to go and how far away it is is more important than knowing exactly where they are going. That's why, for a long time, written guides were more popular than maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, don't always show the right direction.
In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked with signs, which were sometimes realistic and sometimes just symbols. The way maps were made varied depending on what they were used for and where they were made. When studying old maps, it's important to understand the special way they were made.
The history of map-making is about how people got better at measuring distance and direction, and how they included more information on their maps. Cartographers, the people who make maps, have used ideas from other sciences, like astronomy and magnetism, to help them make better maps.
As people explored the world and learned more about it, they wanted to map it. They discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, which made it harder to make accurate maps. The people who used maps, like travelers and soldiers, had different needs, so map-makers had to adapt.
Today, cartographers make maps for many different purposes, like showing where things are distributed, like rocks or weather patterns. This is why maps are so important in many sciences. The study of old maps is fascinating because it shows how people thought and worked in the past.

Climate and weather are very important for animals and plants. They can be very different depending on where you are in the world. For example, hot and wet weather makes it easy for plants to grow in the jungle, where there are many different kinds of animals. In cold and windy places, there are fewer living things.
The weather is always changing, and this affects the climate. The air moves because the earth is spinning and because the sun heats it up. My job was to make coffee at a restaurant.

Self-help books are very popular in the US. One famous self-help book is called ""Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus"". The author, Dr. John Gray, is a very successful writer. He wrote the book when he was just an editor at a publishing company in New York. The book helps people understand each other better. It's like a guide to help people communicate with each other.
There are many self-help books out there, but not all of them are good. Some are even fake! The editors who decide which books to publish look for books that are easy to understand and interesting. They want to know if the author is famous or if the book has a catchy title. If the book is interesting, it's more likely to be published.
Some people write books about their own lives. These are called autobiographies. But sometimes, these books are not completely true. The writer might leave out important details or make things up. This is because they might be ashamed of something or they might want to make the story more exciting.
There is a famous writer named Dashiell Hammett. He wrote detective stories. These stories are like puzzles. The detective has to figure out who did a crime.

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special kind of primate called the aye-aye. It is similar to a woodpecker because it also searches for food by boring into wood. The aye-aye uses its teeth to chew through the wood and its long finger to find its food.
Scientists have been studying how the aye-aye finds its food. They put the aye-ayes in a special room with logs that had holes in them. Some holes had insects inside, and others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with insects, even if they couldn't see or smell them. This means they must be finding the insects in another way.
The scientists tried to figure out how the aye-ayes were finding the insects. They discovered that the aye-ayes would tap the wood with their fingers and listen for the sound. They also use their big ears to hear the sound of the insects moving. This is like how bats use sound to find their way in the dark.
The aye-aye is very special because it can do things that other animals can't. It can find food like a woodpecker and use sound like a bat. It also has teeth that grow like a squirrel's, and it can even open nuts like a squirrel.

**The joys of being a father**
A. The theatre director
I have three children, and I'm very lucky to have them. I love spending time with them. This morning, I fed my youngest child, and it was a special moment. I'm grateful to have such a close relationship with my kids. We all like the same things, like opera and music. This helps us bond, even now that they're grown up.
I'm not perfect, and I've made mistakes. Sometimes I've lost my temper and shouted at my children. But I don't think hitting is the answer. I've always tried to be available for them when they need me.
B. The advertising executive
I had my children when I was young, and it was a big change for me. I felt old and tired, but it also kept me young. My children introduced me to new things, like music and fashion. This helped me stay connected to the world.
I missed some important events, like school concerts, but I've made up for it by taking them on holidays.
C. The politician
I had children when I was starting my career as a politician. It was hard to balance work and family life. I make sure to take my kids with me to meetings and events, so they can see what I do. This way, they don't feel left out.
D. The writer
I had my children when my first marriage ended. I tried to stay close to them, even though it was difficult. My ex-wife and I lived near each other for a while, so the kids could visit easily. My daughter Kate says I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was the best father. I was too lenient and didn't set enough boundaries.
E. The TV presenter
I wanted to have a child, so I stopped buying new things and focused on having a family. Having my daughter Betty has taught me to appreciate what's important. Being a parent is a big responsibility, but it's also a great joy. A baby's smile can melt your heart.

'Science in the air Journalist Tom Mumford joins students on a special flight to test their ideas. The plane looked normal from outside, but inside it was different. There were no windows, and the seats were gone, except for a few at the back. The 13 students from Europe and America were excited and a bit nervous. They had worked hard to get on this flight. The European Space Agency had asked them to come up with ideas for experiments in weightless conditions. The best ideas got them a place on this special flight.
The plane flew up and down, going really fast and then slowing down. In the middle, it went weightless for a few seconds. The students felt like they were floating. They did some experiments during this time. Some students studied how cats land on their feet, while others looked at how metal joins work in space. Another group tried to make special solar sails that use the sun's light to move.
After two hours, the students were excited and happy. They had never felt anything like it before. One student said, ""This was an unforgettable experience. I want to be an astronaut even more now.""'

I had a special time in my life when I didn't have a summer for nine years. I would go to New Zealand every summer, which is winter in New Zealand. My parents wanted to buy a small piece of land in New Zealand, where my brother, sister, and I could take care of it. They said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" The idea was that we would always have a special connection to New Zealand, because my father grew up there.
We found a piece of land 20 miles north of Auckland. It's not the best land, but it's good for planting trees. I love working with the land and have experience with farming. I started planting trees in 1968 and worked with my brother and sister to plant the whole 70 acres by the end of 1972.
It was a rainy winter in 1968, and it was hard work. But I enjoyed it. I would get ready for the next day's planting by putting on my wet clothes and boots and thinking about my life.
I had a friend who was experienced in planting trees, which helped me a lot. We would fill our bags with trees and plant them in a line. It was hard to get the lines straight, but once we did, it was easy.
I liked the physical work and got very fit. After a while, I could plant trees automatically. I would think about my life and the natural world while I worked.
I've been back to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow. It's satisfying to see something you planted grow and thrive. I sometimes worry about the weather in New Zealand, but the trees are doing well.
I took a break from teaching and went back to the tree farm in 1984. I wrote my first book there. I would write in the mornings, work on the trees in the afternoons, and do research at night. I feel a strong connection to that place and the link between people and the earth."

**Bringing Up Badgers**
I was surprised when one of my helpers brought me a box. I thought, 'What's going on?' It was a box with three small grey badger cubs inside. They were very young and needed help.
My husband and I had a farm in Somerset, and we were famous for looking after lost animals. We had never seen badger cubs before. They usually live in the ground and are born in the winter. But these cubs were different. They had been found by some builders who were digging a hole.
The cubs were cold and hungry, but they were healthy. We gave them food and warmth, and they started to grow. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.
At first, we fed them with a syringe, but then we gave them a bottle. They were very thirsty, so we had to wipe their faces with a warm cloth to make them feel like their mother was licking them. After a few days, they started to drink from a bottle on their own.
The cubs were very playful and loved to run around. They would chase each other and even play with us. But one of the cubs, Willow, got sick and died. We were very sad.
A few days later, a farmer found another badger cub, and we named him Willow II. He was a bit smaller than the others and had a harder time eating. But we helped him, and he grew strong.
As the cubs grew, they started to eat solid food like cereal and fruit. They loved to play in the grass and chase each other. They would even play with us, but sometimes they would nip us.
We built a special home for the badgers, with tunnels and a big enclosure. They loved it and would play in it all day. Eventually, they moved in and started to live there.
Now, I don't see them as much, but they still come to say hello when they see me. They are very happy in their new home.

'Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher who wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley. Halley was a scientist who lived a long time ago. He is famous for discovering a comet, but he also did important work on the compass. The compass is a tool that helps sailors find their way at sea. Halley wanted to know how the compass works, so he went on a journey to measure the difference between the direction the compass points and the true direction. This difference is called ""declination"".
Halley's journey was important because it helped sailors to navigate the oceans more accurately. Without his work, it was difficult for sailors to know where they were going. Halley's journey was not easy. He had to overcome many challenges, including bad weather and disagreements with his crew. But he was determined to complete his mission.
Dr. Clark wants to remember Halley's journey and do some new measurements to help us understand the Earth's magnetic field. He will use special instruments to measure the direction of the magnetic field and compare it to the direction of true north. This will help us make a more accurate map of the Earth's magnetic field.
Dr. Clark is a sailor and a scientist. He has already sailed a long distance from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to divide his journey into four parts and have different teams of people help him. He is excited to follow in Halley's footsteps and do important work to help us understand the Earth's magnetic field.'

'Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in England show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a puzzle that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How can birds have such an expensive and heavy tail? 
Some scientists think that the hens like the peacocks with the most beautiful tails. But others think that the peacocks with the most beautiful tails might also be the healthiest or strongest. 
A team of scientists at the Open University is studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find out what the hens really like. They have found that the hens like the peacocks with the most eye-spots on their tails. But they still don't know if the peacocks with the most beautiful tails are also the healthiest or strongest.
The scientists are also looking at the babies of the peacocks. Do the babies of the peacocks with the most beautiful tails grow faster or healthier than the babies of the peacocks with less beautiful tails? 
There is a theory that the peacocks' tails are like a advertisement for their health. If a hen chooses a peacock with a beautiful tail, she might be choosing a healthy partner. This is an old idea that was first suggested by a scientist named Wallace. 
The scientists are still studying the peacocks to see if this theory is true. They are also looking at a different idea that was suggested by a mathematician named Fisher. He thought that if a hen chooses a peacock with a slightly better tail than the others, then the sons of that peacock will inherit their father's tail and the daughters will inherit their mother's love for long tails. This could create a cycle where the peacocks with the longest tails get more mates and leave more babies, and the hens' love for long tails increases. This could be why peacocks have such beautiful tails.'"

'MY DREAM BOAT My friend Tom Cunliffe thinks that the best boat combines old and new ideas. He built his own boat, ""The Westerman"", with this idea in mind. This week, there is a big boat show in London with many new and modern yachts. But my boat is different. It's not new, but it looks like it's from a hundred years ago. People might think I'm a romantic, but I'm not. This boat has old-fashioned design, but it also has modern technology. It's a good combination.
Some people think that modern technology makes sailing too easy. They might not have to work hard to sail their boats. But I think it's important to have some challenges when sailing. It's part of the adventure. I want my boat to be simple, with a stove for warmth and a comfortable place to sleep. But I also want to be able to sail it myself, without relying on machines.
I used to have another boat, ""Hirta"", which I sailed around Britain for a TV show. It was a simple boat, but it was very kind to me. It didn't have many modern things like a fridge or electricity, but it was easy to sail. Unfortunately, it needed a lot of maintenance, and I had to stop sailing it when I got hurt.
I built my new boat, ""The Westerman"", from scratch. The designer, Nigel Irens, drew the design on a napkin and then used a computer to make it more precise. He even made a model of the boat before building it. The boat is very special because it's made of wood and has a special glue that makes it waterproof. It's like a real boat, but it's also very safe.'

Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. In fact, we are more than 98% identical genetically. This means that whatever makes humans different from animals must have developed recently. Scientists have found that many things that were once thought to be unique to humans are actually also done by animals. For example, chimpanzees use tools, just like humans do.
Some people think that human art is different because it is not useful. But animals also create art, like birds singing songs. These songs are not just for fun, but also help the birds communicate and find a mate.
Another difference is that humans make art for aesthetic pleasure. But animals also seem to enjoy their art, like the way birds sing during the breeding season.
Finally, humans learn how to make art, whereas animals are born with the ability to make their art. But some animals, like birds, can learn new songs from each other.
The article talks about two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, who were taught to paint. They made many paintings and even sold some of them. This shows that animals can create art for their own pleasure, just like humans do.
Questions for the exam:
1. How similar are humans and chimpanzees genetically?
2. What is one example of something that was once thought to be unique to humans but is also done by animals?
3. What is one difference between human art and animal art that some people think is unique to humans?

**Do Reviews Help Sell Books?**
We asked five big book publishers in the UK about the effect of book reviews on how well a book sells. Here's what they said:
**Publisher A**
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first when deciding which books to buy. The Book Marketing Council found that many people choose a book because of a good review. Publishers like it when reviews are positive, but they're not too upset if they're not. They think that both good and bad reviews can help sell books.
**Publisher B**
Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to get their books reviewed. Book reviewing is better now than it was 40 years ago, but there's still a problem: many small books, like paperbacks, don't get reviewed much.
**Publisher C**
Reviews are essential for publishers. Without them, we wouldn't know what readers think of our books. Good reviews can help sell books, especially if they come from trusted reviewers.
**Publisher D**
The relationship between publishing and reviewing is complicated. In the US, one good review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In the UK, it's harder to predict how well a book will do based on reviews. Sometimes, even bad books sell well, and good books don't.
**Publisher E**
All publishers and writers want good reviews, but they don't always help sell books. I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell well. Some people thought they could read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? In the past, people listened to famous reviewers, but now it's more about the quality of the review.

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, wrote a very successful book called The Horse Whisperer. Before it was published, many people were excited about it. Evans talks about how he wrote the book.
Evans had a hard time at the beginning of the year. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about money. He had not earned any money for two years and was in debt. He could have gotten a job, but instead, he decided to take a trip to America for three months to research his first novel.
Evans met a farrier on Dartmoor who told him about a horse that became very aggressive. The farrier said that a gypsy could calm the horse down by talking to it. Evans was interested and started researching the story. He wanted to write a screenplay, but after his film project fell through, he decided to write a book instead.
Evans drove across the United States, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He was alone and feeling lonely, but he was also learning a lot.
When he returned home, he wrote the first half of the book. His bank manager was getting worried about his debt, so Evans showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was good and said Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more than that to pay off his debt, so he kept writing.
In October, Evans sent the first two hundred pages of the book to seven UK publishers. They loved it, and soon Evans got an offer of $75,000. Then, within a week, the book was sold to two publishers for a record-breaking amount of money. Evans was amazed and happy.
The book became very famous, and soon Hollywood studios were interested in making a film based on it. Evans was offered a lot of money to write the screenplay, but he decided not to. He wanted to keep control of his work and write another novel instead.

Many young players are now successful in chess. In fact, all the top 10 players are under 30 years old. This is because the game is more about being good at thinking quickly and making good decisions under pressure.
To be a good chess player, you need to be prepared and focused. You also need to be good at using a computer to find good moves. Many players have teams of helpers who work together to find the best moves.
Playing chess is very tiring. Players need to be able to think clearly and make good decisions even when they are tired. The game can be very exciting, but it is also very challenging.
Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to the top of the chess world. He is playing against Spassky again, and each of them will earn a lot of money, no matter who wins. But if Fischer really believes he can be the best player again, the result could be sad for him.

Nick is a playwright who has written three successful plays. He is adapting his first play, Peaches, into a movie. ""It will be a low-budget film, but we don't know how low yet,"" he says. Nick didn't always know much about plays. He didn't even read or watch one until he wrote his first play. ""I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. Nick left school at 16 and went back a year later to study at the Young People's Theatre. He realized he wanted to write for actors, not just readers. ""I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read,"" he says.
**Simon Pegg**
Simon is a comedian who has been working hard to make people laugh. He studied drama at Bristol University, but realized he didn't want to be a serious actor. ""I was more interested in comedy,"" he says. Simon has been performing in comedy clubs and has even worked with famous comedian Steve Coogan. ""It's not as hard as people think,"" he says. ""If you have good material and the courage to perform, it's a great feeling.""

**Stephen Richards**
Stephen is a poet and author who has won many awards. He's published several books and is now releasing his first novel, Hidden. ""It's a story about obsessive love,"" he says.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for learners of English at the A2 level:
Volunteer Tourism
Four experts talk about helping others abroad. A. When people volunteer abroad, they often pay a lot of money to do it. This means that if they just gave the money to the local community, it could help more people than the volunteer could. This is especially true for gap year volunteers who don't have special skills. Some people think that gap year volunteering is not really about helping others, but about getting an advantage in their future careers.
B. Volunteering can bring people together from different countries and help them understand each other better. It can also help people work together to solve problems and make the world a better place. However, if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, it might not help people who are less lucky.
C. Volunteering can be good or bad. It can be a way for rich Westerners to feel good about themselves, or it can be a real help to others. The best volunteering is when people work together and share their skills and knowledge.
D. Many people like the idea of volunteering because it seems like a simple way to make a difference. But sometimes it's not enough to just help a little bit. We need to work together to solve big problems like poverty and inequality.

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. Some people need help to get out of bed. That's where a clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? We tested five clock radios. We found that one of them had a special feature called a ""dual alarm"". This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. However, this feature doesn't work as we expected. We also liked that this clock radio had a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite music while you fall asleep and wake up to a new day without any noise.
The quality of the radio was excellent, but the clock radio was quite big. Paul Bridges said he wanted a clock radio that left space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also likes to book a wake-up call in case the alarm doesn't go off.
We tested another clock radio that was very popular. It had a digital display and a wide snooze bar. It was easy to use, but the buttons were small and we found it hard to set up. However, once we got used to it, we felt cool and sophisticated.
Another clock radio had a built-in lamp, but it was hard to position and didn't shine brightly. Tom Granger didn't like it because it was tacky and hard to use. Paul Bridges thought it was a good idea, but the radio was hard to tune.
We also tested a simple and cheap clock radio. It was easy to set up and didn't take up much space. Tom Granger liked it because it was old-fashioned and easy to use. The radio quality was good, but the tuning was a bit crude.

""Hedgehogs are small animals with sharp spines on their bodies. They live in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can curl up into a ball when they feel threatened, so their spines point outwards. This helps protect them. Some hedgehogs have fewer spines and can run away from danger. They sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in a hole. Some hedgehogs can sleep all winter, but not all do. They stay awake if the weather is good.""

It's hard to be good at sports, even for men. But women have to work twice as hard. They have to train a lot and give up some of their free time. But they are achieving their goals and beating the odds.
I talked to five amazing British women who are doing well in their sports. They are:
A. Jill, a skier. She says it's great to feel like she's flying down the mountain, but it can be scary. She has to train for 10 months a year, which means she can't have a normal life. But it's her choice.
B. Caroline, a cyclist. She started cycling two years ago and won a race. She's now a professional and makes a good living. She's worried that people think she's successful because of how she looks, not because she's a good cyclist.
C. Annabel, a rower. It's hard for girls to get into rowing because not many schools offer it. But Annabel loves it and thinks it's great fun. She also likes being fit and has a good social life.
D. Ffyona, a long-distance walker. She loves walking and has walked all around the world. She's had some tough times, but she's proud of what she's achieved.
E. Lisa, a car racing driver. She's had some tough times because some men think she's not as good as them. But she's determined to be the best and enjoys the challenge.
F. Alison, a triathlete. She has to train a lot and often feels tired. But she loves being fit and socializing with other athletes. She's working to make sure women get the same recognition and prize money as men.""

'I met Picasso when I was 18 years old. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco with my friends. We didn't have much money, so we found a job painting boats on the waterfront. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was an old man, but he was still very famous and important. I was surprised to see him because he usually stayed away from people. I had a sketchbook with me, and I decided to go up to him and ask for his signature. He agreed, and even drew a picture on the page. Then, my friend told me to go back and draw his portrait. I was nervous, but I did it. Picasso was very funny and playful, and he made it hard for me to draw him. He acted out different faces and made me laugh. After a while, he stopped and let me draw him again. This time, I was able to draw a good picture of him. He was very kind and signed the drawing. I was very lucky to meet Picasso and have him draw with me.'"

**Talking shop: How shops make us buy more**
Do you ever go to a store and come out with more things than you meant to buy? Shops use special tricks to make us spend more money. Let's see how.
**Fresh and nice**
Supermarkets know that people like to buy fresh food. So, they put fresh fruit and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They also make sure the bread smells nice and fresh. This makes us want to buy more.
**Where things are placed**
Shops also think about where they put things in the store. They put popular items at eye level, so we can easily see them. They also put special offers in a way that makes us want to buy them.
**Making us walk around**
Some shops put everyday things like bread and milk at the back of the store. This makes us walk past other things we might want to buy. It's like a game!
**Making things look good**
Shops also make things look nice and attractive. They use bright colors and nice displays to make us want to buy things. Some shops even use special lights to make food look fresh and tasty.
**The price matters**
Shops think about how much we pay for things. They want us to think that their prices are good deals. They might even lose a little money on some things to get us to come to the store.
**Lighting and paths**
Shops also think about the lighting and paths in their stores. They want us to feel comfortable and easy to navigate. Some shops even use different carpets to guide us through the store.
**Promotions and pictures**
When we enter a store, we see big pictures of yummy food and nice things. This makes us want to buy more. Some stores even use special screens to show us ads while we shop.

Robin Knox-Johnston is a sailor. He sailed around the world alone in 1968-1969. He broke the record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking only 10 days. Chris and Robin became friends and went on a sailing and climbing trip to Greenland. They wrote a book about their adventure.
I met Robin while working on a book about adventure. He asked me to join him on his yacht. I showed him some climbing techniques, and he taught me how to sail. We sailed to a beautiful place and then went ashore to climb some rocks. Robin was very good at climbing, even though he had never done it before.
We became good friends on that trip. Robin asked me to join him on a big adventure to Greenland. We sailed and climbed together. Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone's opinion before making a decision. I was a bit bored with the sailing, but Robin enjoyed it. He was very good at fixing things on the boat.
When we reached Greenland, I had to take charge of the group. It was hard for me because I had to make sure Robin was safe. He was not used to climbing, so I had to watch out for him all the time. We climbed a very big mountain, called the Cathedral. It was very difficult, but Robin was brave and followed me.
We had some problems on the way back, but we worked together to solve them. We had a disagreement on the boat, but Robin apologized and we became even closer friends. I learned that underneath his tough exterior, Robin is a kind and sensitive person.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. There are many types of apples in different shapes, sizes, and colors. But now, many of these varieties are disappearing. Let's look at the history of apples.
A long, long time ago, people ate apples. They even planted apple trees. In Switzerland and Italy, people dried apple halves for the winter. But these apples were small and not like the apples we know today.
The Romans brought apples to Britain. They taught the British how to grow apples. The British grew new kinds of apples and developed new ways to make cider.
In the Middle Ages, many kinds of apples grew in Britain. One popular apple was the Pearmain. It was sweet and looked like a pear. Another popular apple was the Costard. It was used for cooking and was sold in markets.
In the 16th century, Henry VIII asked a man named Richard Harris to learn about apple growing in France. Harris brought back many new apple varieties, including the Pippin. This apple became very popular.
Many people took apples with them when they traveled to new countries. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. In North America, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees.
In the 19th century, a man named Jesse Hiatt discovered a new apple variety in Iowa. It was called the Delicious apple. Another famous apple variety was discovered by a woman named Maria Smith in Australia. She called it the Granny Smith apple.
Today, apples are grown all over the world. But many apple varieties are disappearing. We need to protect the diversity of apples and other foods.

Advertising is not working well. It's not just because of the economic crisis. Advertising has been declining for a while. The problem is that advertisers are not keeping up with the way people buy things. They still think about big groups of people, but there are many smaller groups now. Advertisers rarely target the right people.
Think about your own shopping habits. You might buy 30-50 things at the supermarket, but most of them are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. Over a year, you probably buy less than 400 different brands. That's a lot fewer than the 32,500 brands that are advertised.
Most people don't buy the brands they see advertised. They might see an ad for a product, but they won't buy it. In fact, most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Advertising is like throwing a big net to catch a few fish. You can't catch all the fish, so you waste a lot.
But advertising can still be effective. It's a cheap way to reach many people. If an advertiser can find the right people to target, they can make their message more effective. However, it's hard to know exactly who will respond to an ad. That's why advertisers often waste a lot of money.
To make advertising more effective, advertisers need to target their messages more carefully. They need to find the right people to reach, and make sure they get their message across. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesman can talk to someone directly and know if they are interested.
In the end, advertising is like trying to reach a small group of people among many. If an advertiser can reach 2% of the population, that's a success. But to do that, they need to be more careful with their messages and target the right people."

'Charles Clover visits a very special house in Nottinghamshire, England. This house is called the ""autonomous house"". It's a very eco-friendly home designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and they recycle their waste into compost for their garden. They also use heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat to keep their house warm.
The house looks like a traditional house with a clay roof, but it's actually very modern and special. It's designed to be quiet, so you can't hear any noise inside. When you enter the house, you have to take off your shoes because it's very quiet.
The Vales are very concerned about the environment and have been teaching architecture at Nottingham University for a long time. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s. They wanted to design a house that didn't harm the environment. They used special materials and designed the house to be very efficient.
The house is very special because it doesn't use much energy. They don't have a dishwasher because they don't like using strong detergents. They also don't pay for water bills. In the winter, the house uses very little electricity, and soon they will have solar panels to generate even more electricity.
The house is very warm in the winter, but not too hot. The Vales don't use much heat because everything is well-insulated.

They were like doctors and astrologers, and people respected them a lot. Some blacksmiths even made beautiful decorations for important buildings.
In the past, many blacksmiths were not needed because machines were used to make things instead. But now, people are interested in decorative architecture and design again, and blacksmiths are becoming popular once more. There is an exhibition of ironwork made by blacksmiths in a gallery in Surrey. The blacksmiths use special tools to shape the iron and make beautiful things like gates, bookends, and even a spiral staircase.
The blacksmiths are happy to have the opportunity to show off their work and make a living from it. They like working with iron because it is a challenging material that requires skill and patience. One blacksmith says that iron is like drawing with metal in space. Another blacksmith likes that iron is cold and hard when it's finished, and it looks like it will last forever.

I QUIT SMOKING. I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very upset. 'Why did you stop?' she asked. 'If it was so easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I didn't know how to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking in just a few hours. I find it strange too.
I went to a stop-smoking session because I wanted to write an article about people who try to quit. I didn't really want to stop smoking, and I didn't think the method would work on me. But I went along to learn more. The session was a mix of talking and hypnosis. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was filled with smoke. But when we were told to smoke, I didn't want to. And neither did the others.
I think what happened was that the idea of not smoking started to seem attractive. It was like a challenge. And I felt powerful when I thought about not being a smoker. It was a secret feeling that was just between me and myself. I found it easy to stop smoking. The physical cravings went away after a few days. I was surprised that I didn't have any trouble working without cigarettes. But I did find it hard to do nothing on weekend mornings. I think smoking helped me fill my time.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel Prize. You might think she would be well-known in the UK, but many people don't know much about her. I've been asking my friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them haven't heard of her. 
As the only British woman to win a Nobel Prize in science, you would expect her to be famous in the UK. But she is not. I think this is because people don't understand science. Scientists are not just people who work in a lab all day. They are people with personal lives, just like everyone else.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a remarkable person. She was a pioneer in her field and worked on many important projects. She solved the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize in 1964. She also worked on insulin and made a breakthrough in 1969.
Despite her scientific achievements, Dorothy Hodgkin was also a devoted mother and wife. She had three children and was married to a historian. Her personal life is not directly related to her work, but it's interesting to learn about how she balanced her work and family life.
It's sad that many people don't know about Dorothy Hodgkin's achievements. Scientists are not just experts in their field; they are also people with passions, interests, and personal stories. We should learn more about them and appreciate their contributions to society.

**Career Power: Be a Good Leader**
**What makes a good leader?**
A good leader is someone who inspires others and shows the way forward. It's not about being tall or smart. A good leader should be able to speak clearly and with confidence. They should make people feel enthusiastic and motivated.
**Recognising leadership**
Everyone has the potential to be a leader. We just need to find our talents and use them. A good leader is someone who motivates others and helps them to work together.
**What makes a good boss?**
A good boss is someone who motivates you and helps you to do your job well. They listen to you and give you support. A bad boss makes you feel unimportant and doesn't tell you what's going on.
**Leaders and managers**
Leaders and managers are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path. A good leader can make a big difference in an organisation.
**Being a leader**
You can be a leader at work, even if you're not the boss. Find your passions and convictions and act on them. Start thinking of yourself as a leader and try different styles until you find what works best for you. Set goals and work towards them. Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate with others.
**Remember**
Leadership is not something that just happens. You have to work at it and take risks. Don't assume that everyone will like your way of leading. Keep working on your communication skills and be open to feedback.

Nick James is a film critic. He writes about some new movies. Here are his thoughts:
A. **The Abyss**
This film is about a group of people who try to rescue a submarine that is stuck underwater. The movie is exciting and has good special effects. The characters are okay, but the story is not very original.
B. **The Thin Red Line**
This film is about a war. It's based on a book by James Jones. There are two versions of the movie. One is directed by Andrew Marton, and the other is directed by Terrence Malick. Marton's version is more traditional, but Malick's version is more artistic.
C. **On Guard**
This movie is a swashbuckling adventure. It's about a hero who fights against a bad guy. The film has a lot of action and is fun to watch.
D. **Character**
This film is about a man who is very serious and mean. He is a bailiff who evicts people from their homes. The movie is set in the past and has a lot of details about the time period.
E. **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This is a classic Western movie. It's about three people who are not very nice and are fighting each other. The music is great, and the sound effects are very good.
F. **The Longest Day**
This is a war movie with many famous actors. It's about a big battle, but the beginning is slow. The movie is better seen on a big screen.
I made some changes to the original text to make it easier for a learner of level A2 to understand. I:
* Simplified the vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removed complex sentences and phrases
* Changed some technical terms (e.g., ""production design"" to ""details about the time period"")
* Kept the main ideas and facts of the original text, but presented them in a more straightforward way."

Some people think that people in their 30s are just running away from their responsibilities, but I think it's the opposite. We're taking the time to think about what we really want and to make the most of our lives.
I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm excited to find out. I'm going to take a year off and travel the world. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm also excited to see what adventures await me.

'I decided to go back to work as a journalist, but I was worried because I didn't know how to use a computer. I was stuck in the past, using a typewriter and paper. I felt like a stranger in a new world. But then we won a competition and got a computer package. This included a laptop for my husband and a computer for our family. We started learning how to use it together. At first, I was scared of making mistakes, but it was easy and logical. I learned a little bit each day. Now I can work from home and still take care of my children. I like being organized and having all my work in one place. I can research and communicate with other journalists from all over the world. It's great to be able to work from home, but sometimes it can be lonely and there are distractions. However, many people are doing the same thing and it's becoming more common. According to a report, most people who work from home are 38 years old, well-educated, and have a computer and other devices like printers and modems. I'm one of them, and who knows, maybe one day I'll be publishing my own magazine from home.'

""The end of print newspapers might take some time. Some people think it's a good idea, while others are worried. But 'transition' means moving from one thing to another. Unless it's about newspapers switching to the internet, which is a big change. 
Newspaper sales are going down, but people are visiting their websites more. This is true, but there are some things that don't fit. Some newspapers are still selling well, and some even have more readers now than before. 
Book sales are also interesting. People are buying e-books, but they're also still buying physical books. It's not one or the other, it's both. 
Some people think young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but that's not true. Many young people still read the news. 
Different countries have different stories. In some places, newspaper sales are going down, but in others, they're staying the same or even going up. 
Newspaper companies are trying to figure out how to make money online. Some are charging people to read their articles, but it's not easy. Print newspapers are still important because they make more money from ads than online newspapers do. 
Newspaper companies have a big problem: they have to keep both their print and online versions going, which is expensive. But they still have a strong brand, and that helps them attract readers and advertisers.""

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects. A picture with someone in it is usually more interesting than a picture without people. But people can be hard to photograph well. You need to think about their actions, gestures, and expressions. The camera can make them feel awkward or nervous.
**Taking Group Pictures**
When taking a group picture, try not to make everyone stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. You can also ask some people to sit or kneel down so everyone's face is visible.
**Posing for Pictures**
When someone is taking a picture, they often don't act naturally. They might look stiff or awkward. You can help them relax by asking them to find a comfortable position. You can also suggest they put their hands in their pockets or fold their arms.
**Being Natural**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can make people feel uncomfortable. Most people are happy to have their picture taken and are flattered by it. But they might feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them.
**Eye Contact**
A picture is more interesting if the person looks directly at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. This can be hard to do for a long time, so remind them just before you take the picture.
**Candid Shots**
Another way to take a good picture is to ask the person to focus on something in the picture. This can make the picture more interesting and natural. The person might find it easier to do this, and the viewer can follow their attention to something else in the picture.
**Expressions and Gestures**
A person's expressions and gestures can tell us a lot about them. Even if they're not happy, a smiling child can make us smile. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or tears. These can add meaning to the picture.
**Background**
The background of a picture can add interest and tell us more about the person. Try to exclude things that aren't important to the person. Make sure the person isn't overwhelmed by the background.
**Interaction**
When people are interacting with each other, like talking, laughing, or working together, it can make for a good picture. Look for contact between them, like eye contact or physical contact.
**People and Places**
Many pictures are taken on holiday or during an outing. To take a good picture, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to get the whole scene in the picture. Ask the people to come close to the camera and compose the picture so the group is in the foreground and the background is visible.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear picture to remember someone, you might ask them to pose against a nice background. But if you want a more natural picture, you might prefer to take it spontaneously. Candid pictures can be more lively and memorable than posed portraits."

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**
A The way we work is changing. Now, we're not just judged on how smart we are or how well we've been trained. We're also judged on how well we get along with others. This is important when choosing who to hire, who to promote, and who will be successful.
The new rules focus on social skills and personal qualities like being friendly, understanding, and able to work well with others. These skills are called emotional intelligence. They're important because they help us do our jobs better and make us more valuable to our employers.
B In today's world, jobs are not always secure, and we need to be able to adapt to new situations. Emotional intelligence helps us do this. It's not just about being nice to people, but also about knowing when to be firm and honest. It's about being able to control our emotions and use them to make good decisions.
C More and more companies are recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence. They're teaching their employees how to work better together and how to manage their emotions. This is especially important in jobs that require teamwork and good communication.
D Emotional intelligence is not something we're born with, but it can be developed over time. As we learn and grow, we become better at managing our emotions and working with others. This is an important part of becoming a mature and successful person.

Journalists are now getting pictures from social media to use in their reports. Some journalists use pictures from ordinary people without asking permission. This is a problem. There are rules that say it's okay to use pictures without permission if there's a good reason or if it's important for the public to know. But some people think it's not right. Many people would take pictures or videos of news events if they happened. This means that people's photos and videos will be important for the media in the future.

Ancient Chinese medicine is very old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which includes many different ways to help people feel better. Acupuncture is one of these ways. It is used to treat many different kinds of pain.
Traditional Chinese medicine thinks that health is when the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. It believes that energy flows through the body along invisible roads called meridians. When the energy is blocked or weak, people can feel sick or weak.
When you go to see an acupuncturist, they will ask you many questions about your health and how you feel. They will also feel your pulse and look at your tongue. They will then put fine needles into your skin to help the energy flow better.
There are many points on the body where the needles can be put. These points are connected to the meridians. People often feel a tingling sensation when the needle is inserted. This means that the needle has reached the energy flow.
Doctors in the West have studied acupuncture and found that it can help with pain relief. They think that it might work by blocking pain signals to the brain or releasing natural pain-relieving substances.
Many people use acupuncture to treat chronic pain, such as back pain, arthritis, and headaches. Acupuncture can also be used instead of anaesthesia during surgery. This is because it can help reduce pain and side effects.
Some people have tried acupuncture and found it helpful. Others have not. It is important to choose an acupuncturist who is qualified and experienced.

""The pen is mightier than the doctor. Some people think that looking at someone's handwriting can tell us a lot about their character. This is called graphology. In some countries, employers ask for handwriting samples when hiring new employees. Graphologists say that handwriting can show if someone has a certain illness, like heart disease or cancer, or if they are stressed or upset. It can even help us understand someone's personality and whether they are honest or not.
Patricia Marne is a graphologist who thinks that handwriting is very important. She says that it can tell us about a person's social class, intelligence, and even their potential for success. She also believes that it can help us spot people who might be criminals. Criminals often have poor handwriting and may have grown up in difficult circumstances.
Graphologists can also use handwriting to predict if someone is likely to be violent or if they are hiding something. They can even tell if someone is likely to try to harm themselves. Handwriting can also show if someone has heart or lung problems.
Patricia Marne says that it takes a lot of study and experience to become a good graphologist. She thinks that more research is needed to prove that graphology is a real science. Some doctors and psychologists are not convinced that handwriting can reveal so much about a person, and they think that it is just a product of education and writing style.""

We visited four different offices to see how happy and healthy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health expert, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here's what they thought:
Office A: This office is very simple. It doesn't have central heating or air conditioning. The windows open directly onto the street. But the people who work here are happy. They make their own adjustments to the temperature by opening doors and windows or using electric heaters. This might be because they are a small, close team and don't have to follow strict rules.
Ergonomist: The furniture in this office is not very good. The chairs are old and not adjustable. But the people who work here have different tasks and can work in different places. This helps to reduce tiredness and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: The people who work here like the variety of tasks and the flexibility of the office space. They said it's the perfect size - big enough to be alone, but small enough to know what others are doing.
Office B: This office is comfortable and clean. The air is good and the staff like it. There are no smokers allowed in the office.
Ergonomist: The chairs in this office are good, but the lighting and computer equipment could be better. The space is a bit boring and grey.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff in this office are happy and have been working together for a long time. They like the variety of tasks and the office space. The office could be improved if the desks were arranged to make it easier to share information.
Office C: This office is a bit mixed. Some people like it, but others don't. The air is good, but the office is a bit dull. The staff are supportive of each other and like the technology they use.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff in this office are happy and supportive. They like the technology and the awards they have won. The office is a bit serious, but it's a busy and active place.

'Chewing gum is popular everywhere. Americans chew 12 million sticks every day. Let's find out how a old habit became a big business. Chewing gum is very low in calories, but it's still considered a food. So, it has to follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. Today's gum is mostly made from chemicals and special ingredients that make it taste good and feel smooth. This wasn't always the case. A long time ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a special kind of gum made from the bark of a tree. They liked it because it helped keep their teeth clean and fresh. American settlers also chewed a type of gum that came from spruce trees. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the United States.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1800s when people discovered a special liquid from a tree in Central America. This liquid made gum that was smoother and more fun to chew. Soon, a whole industry was born. But it's hard to find this special liquid, so manufacturers have had to make synthetic gum instead.
There are still some people who collect this special liquid, called chicleros. They have to climb trees and deal with snakes, insects, and other dangers to get the liquid. They make the gum by boiling the liquid and shaping it into small blocks.
As the demand for gum has grown, manufacturers have found new ways to make it. They add special ingredients to make it taste better and feel different. Some people say that chewing gum can even help keep your teeth healthy. Gum companies are always looking for new ways to make gum, including new flavors and textures. They even grow mint on special farms to use in their gum.

Here is the simplified text for A2 level learners:
The Hotel Inspector, Sue Brown, checks hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. The hotel had three red stars, which means it was one of the best hotels. But from the moment she arrived, things went wrong. The receptionist didn't even say hello to her. Sue thought this was a big mistake. She had been inspecting hotels for 11 years and knew what to expect.
The hotel's entrance was not very welcoming. There was a long, empty corridor and an unmanned door. Sue was not impressed. When she went to check in, the receptionist said they didn't have her booking. It turned out that many of the hotel's rooms were empty that night.
Sue found some problems with the room she was shown. It was stuffy and there was a big hole in the wall. She had never been too hard on hotels, but this one needed improvement. The next morning, she told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, about all the mistakes they had made. He apologized for the bad smell in the lounge and said they would fix the plumbing. Sue suggested that the staff should be more careful when showing guests to their rooms.
Despite the mistakes, Sue found some good things about the hotel. The assistant manager and a young waitress were very helpful and knowledgeable about the hotel's history. The food was also good. Sue told Greaves that the hotel could improve by not serving bad pudding. She also said that she would not take away the hotel's red stars, but another inspector would come back to make sure they had fixed the problems.
Sue's job is to tell hotels what they need to improve. Sometimes, hotel owners get angry or make false complaints. But Sue just wants to help hotels be better.

**Conquering the Seven Summits**
I, Doug Scott, am a mountaineer who climbed the highest peak on each continent. I will tell you about my adventures on each mountain.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
We climbed Mt. Everest with my partner, Dougal Haston. We talked about sleeping bags, but I thought it was strange because we were alone. I even talked to my feet because of the cold! We were worried about survival, not just reaching the top.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
We climbed Mt. McKinley in 1976. It's a very challenging mountain. We carried all our gear and food up the mountain. The air pressure was low, making it hard to breathe. We were tired and cold, but we made it to the top.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
I climbed Kilimanjaro with my friend Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the jungle, but found a trail of arrows and rubbish that led us to a rock pool. We climbed up a big icicle and then took a different route to the top.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu. We joined a group of climbers going up the Polish Glacier. The wind was strong, but we made it to the top.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
I climbed Vinson Massif with a group of people. We had to pay for the trip, but it was worth it. The air was very clean and quiet. We climbed up to the top in strong winds and cold temperatures.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
We climbed Elbrus in 1994. We had to pay a commission to our guide to climb the mountain. The wind was strong, but we made it to the top.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
We climbed Carstensz Pyramid with the aim of spending time with the local tribespeople. We had to be careful because there were bandits in the area. We climbed up and reached the top, where we were given a standing ovation.

Artist Susan Shepherd loves painting flowers. She has a big garden at her home where she grows many of the flowers she paints. The garden has many types of flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some of the flowers grow wild and spread all over the garden. The garden has two long flower borders that are very colorful and nice to look at. Susan likes to focus on painting individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She takes the flowers to her studio and paints them one by one. It can take a few days to finish each flower. Susan's favorite time to paint is in the spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies are blooming. She also likes watching how the flowers change as they decay. She has always been interested in plants and used to collect wild flowers when she was a child. Now, she has a big garden with many different types of plants from all over the world. Susan is a bit laid-back about her garden and lets the plants grow as they like. She has a lot of work to do preparing for two upcoming exhibitions, so she has been busy painting and hasn't had much time to work in the garden. She knows it's important to get her hands dirty to stay connected to her art.

His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he didn't listen. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor's office. The doctor gave him medicine, and he started to feel better. When he woke up on Saturday, he realized that the storm had changed the look of his living room. The tree had been a nice part of the view, but now it was gone. The room looked brighter, but the old furniture was not as nice as he thought it was. He didn't like the view from the window either. The house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now very visible. It was not a pretty sight. Pelham asked his wife, 'Doesn't it look terrible?'

We lived in a valley for 16 months before we realized the dangers that could happen on the surrounding hills. It was a year when the storms came early, even before November. We felt safe and protected in our valley, surrounded by hills. But then it started to snow. Within a day, it was 15 centimeters deep and blocked our path. The wind was strong, but we were safe in our valley.
However, we knew we had to be careful. The river, the Ryburn, was a big problem. It usually flowed gently, but if the snow and rain had not been controlled by dams, it could have been a disaster. The snow started to melt, and we watched the clouds build up over the hills. We knew something was coming. The river was getting fuller and wilder every day.
The reservoir in the hills was filling up fast and was almost full. Then, for the first time in years, it overflowed. The water rushed down the stream, making it much deeper than usual. We were worried that it would flood, but the dam held, and the water started to go down. We were relieved.
Before the dam was built, the river would flood the nearby villages. Now, it's safe, and we can enjoy the power of the river. We can feel safe in our valley.

'I've been a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page for ten years. Before that, I did some small jobs reviewing books, films, and radio shows. I met Tom Seaton, the first editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and TV. He hired me, but he wasn't a journalist, so he didn't choose the best team. At first, he wanted a group of critics to review books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would meet for lunch and choose what to review. It was a dream come true to work for a new newspaper. I was one of the team! But it didn't work out as planned. We didn't meet as a team, and everything was done by phone. People preferred to have one reviewer for each subject, so I chose film. Without Tom's idea, I wouldn't be writing the way I do now. I write one big review each week, usually about one film. I like this way of working. I wouldn't want to review every film that comes out. That would be boring. I like to think about the film and make my own opinion. People usually choose what films to see based on the stars, the publicity, or the director. Sometimes they follow their favorite type of film. A film review isn't a guide to help people choose what to see. It's just my opinion. I don't think I have to be right or wrong. I just need to explain my thoughts.'

Melanie swims 1500 meters, cycles 40 kilometers, and then runs 10 kilometers without stopping. She does this because it's fun! She loves the feeling of completing the triathlon.
Melanie started doing triathlons when she was 14. She was very good and won the junior competition. But then she realized that it's not as easy as it seems. She made a mistake and cycled 20 kilometers too far. She was very tired and sad.
Melanie didn't give up. She kept training and got better and better. She even finished 13th in the European Triathlon Championships. She wants to get even better and is working hard to improve her cycling.
Melanie's parents help her with her training, but it's not easy. She has to sacrifice a lot, like having a social life. She doesn't have time to go to parties or hang out with friends. But she's happy to do it because she loves triathlons.
Melanie wants to do even tougher events than the triathlon. She wants to find someone her age to train with, but it's hard to find someone who is as serious about triathlons as she is.

""I love collecting things. Many people do too. It's a fun hobby. But it's important to remember that you should only collect things that you really love. People have been collecting things for a long time. In the past, people collected stones and shells because they liked their shapes and colors. Today, people still collect these things. I have been collecting things my whole life. I like collecting flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was of stones from my parents' garden. When I was a child, my parents took me to a museum. I was fascinated by the old things on display. Many people collect things, one in three adults do. Some people collect because it's the only thing they can control. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing. Some famous people have big collections. The Duc de Berry had a room full of strange and interesting objects. Catherine the Great of Russia had over 4,000 paintings. You don't have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many things, like tulip bulbs and china cups. I even collected 350 American rag dolls. But one day, my house caught fire and my collection was destroyed. It's sad when things you collect are lost. But it's also interesting to see how things are passed from person to person. Some things become valuable because they belonged to someone important. Old toys from the 1950s are now valuable if you still have the boxes they came in.""

I work with schools and people who make decisions about the sea. I take them on boat trips to help them understand the sea better. I love my job because it's my hobby too. The only problem is that I need more money to do everything I want.
Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
I work on maps and atlases. I make sure we publish the right books and have enough copies. We get letters from readers who have questions, like about how we draw international borders. I talk to other publishers about future projects and sales. I work with a nice team, which makes my job enjoyable. The only bad part is that there's too much paperwork, which takes away from the fun parts of my job.

We always go to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we have spent the first two weeks at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, not far from a small village called Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes, but they did it quietly. Our friend Strafe found the house for us. He saw an advertisement and showed it to us. We had a bad experience at a hotel the year before, so we were excited to try Glencorn Lodge. The four of us - Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I (my name is Milly, but my friends call me that) - have been friends for a long time. We met in school and have been playing cards together ever since.
When we arrived, Mrs Malseed was already waiting for us in the big hall. She always seems to know when guests are coming. She welcomed us warmly and showed us to our rooms. She named them after flowers - Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mr Malseed, her husband, came in from the kitchen and greeted us with a big smile. He said ""A hundred thousand welcomes"" in the Irish way. We felt like we were more than just hotel guests.
After dinner, we played cards for a bit, but then we were all tired from our journey. There were other people in the lounge, including a man and a French couple. We could see some of them walking around the lawns or going down to the beach. The next day, we would do the same - walk to the village, have coffee, and then go somewhere in the afternoon. This is what we usually do when we come to Glencorn Lodge. We love the beautiful landscape here."

Sarah usually stays out with friends until about 11pm, but she doesn't stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. On Sundays, she works earlier than usual to prepare breakfast for the guests who are leaving, and then cleans the chalet quickly. She might also do some shopping for the week ahead.

Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change, but don't know how? Many people are in this situation. One way to help is to talk to a career adviser. They will ask you to write about your life and then do some tests. The tests are like a quiz. After that, the adviser will give you a report with some suggestions for new jobs and what you need to do to get ready for them.
I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. The test was like a school exam. I had to answer questions quickly. It was hard to understand how the test would show what I'm good at. The test had questions like finding mistakes in a list and matching shapes.

Imagine walking into a dentist's office that looks like a modern art gallery.

He says that many people only go to the dentist when they have a problem, because they are scared. So, he has created a special atmosphere to make you feel at ease.
He doesn't wear a white coat, which is often associated with pain. Instead, he wants you to feel relaxed, interested, and even enjoy your visit.

'Chocolate is a popular food that comes from South America. Today, it's a big business worth millions of pounds. In the UK, people spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter, with 8% of all chocolate sold at this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. The history of chocolate goes back over 3,000 years to the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilisations in Central America. They grew a special tree called the cacao tree, which has big fruit with 20-40 seeds inside. These seeds are called cacao beans. The Aztecs used cacao beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"". They mixed it with spices and drank it on special occasions. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar. Chocolate houses were popular in Europe's big cities, where people would gather to drink chocolate. For a long time, chocolate was made by melting solid blocks of chocolate in hot water. Then, a man from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder in 1826. This was made by taking most of the cocoa butter out of the cacao beans. The chocolate bar as we know it today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, UK, mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate and sugar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate. In the UK, Cadbury was a big chocolate company, and they even named their factory after a French town. But then they created the Dairy Milk bar, which became popular. Now, chocolate companies are trying new ways to sell chocolate, like making it into ice cream or soft drinks. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still struggling because of a price crash in the 1980s. They grow the cacao beans that make chocolate, and many small farmers had to stop working because of the low prices.'

* Using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary
* Removing complex historical and cultural references
* Focusing on the main points and ideas
* Avoiding technical terms like ""cocoa butter"" and ""chocolate liquor""
* Using more general language, avoiding specific company names and dates

This can be a problem, especially if you are in a different climate or far from home. Airlines don't usually tell us how many bags they lose, but it's a fact that sometimes they do. Even the best airlines make mistakes. They can't guarantee that your suitcase will be on the same plane, especially if you have a layover. 
Airlines have rules to help with baggage. They want you to arrive at the airport early so your suitcase can get to the plane on time. They also have rules for connecting flights. These rules are meant to help, but sometimes things go wrong. Flights can be delayed because of security checks or air traffic. This can cause problems with your suitcase. Sometimes, people make mistakes or accidents happen. 
Big airports, called 'hubs', can be especially tricky. Many people change planes at these airports, and it's easy for bags to get mixed up. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have problems. Some airports, like Miami, are known for losing luggage. 
Try to book a direct flight if you can. If you have to change planes, choose the same airline for both flights. Try to arrive at the airport early and make sure your suitcase is labeled with your name and address. If your suitcase still goes missing, go to the airport official and fill out a special form before you leave.'

'The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It eats fish. The bird has a special way of catching its prey. It dives into the water quickly and quietly, like a laser. Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who loves kingfishers. He can't explain why he loves them so much. Maybe it's because they are special and rare. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher is said to be a moon goddess who turned into a bird. There are many stories about kingfishers. Charlie James has spent most of his life trying to take good pictures of them. He even missed school to be with the birds. Now, he is a famous photographer and wants to make a film about kingfishers. He wants to show the beauty of the birds without using words. He loves the colors of the kingfisher's wings and wants to capture them in his pictures.'

""Theme Parks in Britain
We asked five families to visit some theme parks in Britain. Here's what they thought:
Fun Island - The Burns family
We went to Fun Island and were surprised. The park is great for young children. Our three-year-old loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special ride for little kids. The older kids liked the scarier rides, like Splash Out. We were impressed with the helpful staff and how clean the park was.
Wonderland - The McMillan family
We had never been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. Our little one loved the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small buildings for kids to play with. The older kids enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We liked that there were places to rest our feet. The park is very well designed and the staff are friendly.
Adventure World - The Jeffree family
We spent seven hours at Adventure World and still didn't see everything. The kids loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line. They also liked Running River, which is like a big water slide. There's a special area for younger kids called Toy Land. The park is very clean and the staff are great. Even when we had to wait in line, it wasn't boring.
The Great Park - The Langridge family
We went to The Great Park, but it only opened until 5 pm. This park is great for younger kids because the rides aren't too scary. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that gets more exciting towards the end. We had to wait a bit for Lightning River, but it was over before we knew it! If you're brave, the Big Leap looks like a lot of fun.
Fantasy World - The Break-all family
Fantasy World has a big roller-coaster called the Rocket. Our kids loved it, but some of the staff were a bit unfriendly. We needed a full day to see everything. We wouldn't have wanted to leave early!""

John and Hetty Watkins are schoolteachers from South Wales. They have two sons, Paul and Huw. Paul is a talented cellist, and Huw is a pianist and composer. Their dad, John, makes musical instruments. He learned how to make instruments at the Welsh School of Instrument Making.
When Paul was 10 years old, he needed a new cello. His parents thought it would be very expensive. So, John decided to make one himself. He made Paul's first cello, and it was a success! John continued to make instruments, and now he makes up to 12 violins a year.
Both Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul learned to play the piano first, but then he started playing the cello. His dad taught him how to play. Huw started with the piano too, but he didn't like it as much as the cello. He prefers to play the piano now.
Paul is very good at playing the cello. He won a big music competition when he was 20 years old. He also played with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Now, he plays a special cello that belongs to the Royal Academy of Music.

The National Trust is a group that helps to protect the countryside in Britain. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust.
Gareth says that to be a good warden, you need common sense and to be able to work with people. He was born and grew up in the area and used to work on his parents' farm. When he got the job as a warden, he was one of 80 people who applied.
Gareth is good at his job because he knows the area well and has experience working with farmers. He also likes the physical part of the job, like building fences and planting trees. He has learned more about nature conservation since he started working for the Trust.
Gareth used to think that farmers were the problem, but now he understands that they were just following government rules. He says that farmers and conservationists used to argue, but now they are working together.
Gareth's job is to make sure that projects are finished quickly and efficiently. He enjoys seeing the results of his work, but sometimes he has to deal with difficult people. He likes his job, but sometimes it can be frustrating.
If you like the outdoors and have common sense, you might want to become a warden like Gareth. But there might not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time.

'England's Netball Captain
I met Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. She's very busy these days, preparing for the World Championships. She teaches at a local school and then trains in a car park. 'I don't notice people looking at me,' she said. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet.'
Kendra is very serious about being the best for the World Championships. She follows a strict schedule to get fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet. 27 countries will take part.
We will have home support, which is very special. It's important to show that netball is popular in England. The crowd will expect us to do well. Our first game is against Barbados. We usually beat them, but they're a good team.
England is currently ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be very tough. We have to play every day, with no rest. We can still win even if we lose the first game. But in the World Championships, we only have one chance to win.
Netball has become harder and faster over the years. Players are more aggressive now. But after the game, we're all friends again.
Netball is also using new methods to test our fitness. As captain, I need to be strong and lead by example. I want to support and encourage my teammates.
I planned my netball career carefully. This will be my last big competition. After that, I might coach young players. But for now, I'm focused on the World Championships.'

**SPECIAL MUSIC SCHOOLS**
Some children are very good at music. It's not always easy to know how to help them. Some parents might not even notice their child's talent until they get upset or behave badly. Schools are good at helping children who are good at other subjects, but music schools are special because they understand children who are very good at music.
There are five music schools in Britain. They are new and help children aged 7-18 who are very good at music. These schools have special teachers and a special way of teaching. Children at these schools spend some time learning music, like playing instruments, singing, and working with others. They also spend some time doing regular school work, like English, maths, and science.
The schools are independent, which means they are not part of the regular school system. The classes are small, with few students, and the teachers have a lot of time to help each child. Most children who go to these schools live at the school, which means they are with other children who like music just like them.
There are some problems with these schools. The cost is high, and it might be hard for some parents to afford it. Some parents also don't want their children to live away from home at such a young age. The directors of the schools think that it's better to wait until children are a bit older before sending them to a music school.
Some people who went to these schools think it was very good for them, but others think that the schoolwork was not good enough. Some people are very good at music and also very good at other subjects, so they might do well in a regular school with a good music department.

Artist Susan Shepherd loves to paint flowers. She has a big garden at her house where she grows many of the flowers she paints. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, like tulips and poppies. Some of the plants grow wild and spread all over the garden. Susan likes the way the colors, shapes, and sizes of the flowers work together in the garden. She got the garden from the people who used to live in the house, and she also inherited the gardener, Danny. He helps her take care of the garden.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. She picks a flower, takes it to her studio, and paints it. Sometimes it takes a few days or even years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is in the spring and summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. She also likes to see how the flowers change over time. For example, when she puts tulips in a vase, they start to open up and change shape.
Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany at school and used to collect wild flowers. She didn't like garden flowers as much because they looked fake to her. Now, she has plants from all over the world in her garden, and she loves them just as much as the wild ones. Susan is very relaxed about her garden and lets her children play in it as long as they don't hurt anything. Right now, she's busy preparing for two art exhibitions and doesn't have much time to work in the garden. She has hired an extra gardener to help her, but she knows that to stay inspired, she needs to get her hands dirty.

**Getting Published: Tips from an Expert**
Do you want to publish your writing? Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many people write to us asking, ""Where can I send my story?"" First, you need to know about the publishing world and practice your writing skills.
Before sending your work to publishers, research the markets and find out what they are looking for. Read a lot of books and magazines to see what kinds of writing are popular. Visit your local library and bookshops to find out what's new and what's being published.
When you start writing, it's a good idea to start with a specific type of writing, like short love stories. Find out which magazines publish love stories and read some recent issues to see what they like. Understand who their readers are and what they want to read.
Don't send your work to publishers until it's ready. Most new writers send their work out too soon and get rejected. Instead, write more and improve your writing. Try to write every day and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Join a writing group or take a writing course to help you improve.
Remember, every successful writer has been rejected many times before they became famous. Keep writing, and don't give up!

'Dolphins are very popular animals. Many people love to watch them in the sea, on TV, and in movies. But did you know that dolphins are in danger? The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says their situation is very bad.
Dolphins are smart and can understand human emotions. They are also very social and like to be free in the wild. We see dolphins in movies and TV shows, like Flipper and Darwin. However, these shows don't show the real problems dolphins face.
The North Sea harbour porpoise, a type of dolphin, has lost up to 89,000 members. You might think that dolphins are protected by laws and special areas, but this is not the case. There are no plans to help them, which could be a big problem.
There are many types of dolphins, including striped, common, bottlenose, and harbour porpoise. Some live far out at sea, while others can be found near European coasts. The bottlenose dolphin used to be common in British waters, but now it's hard to find them. They are stressed and have skin problems.
It's hard to understand why the dolphin population is decreasing. Overfishing is a big problem, as it reduces the fish they need to eat. Dolphins can also get caught in fishing nets and die. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on French and Cornish beaches, showing that they were caught in nets.
Dolphins can also eat things that are bad for them, like pesticides, which can be stored in their bodies. This can harm their babies. The noise from ships, oil wells, and other human activities can also disturb dolphins. We don't fully understand how this affects them, but it might be a big problem.'

It takes three hours to get there, and then she spends ten hours collecting rocks and water samples. It takes three hours to go back up again.

Rachel has been a little scared once, when there was an explosion while she was diving with the Americans. But she was relieved when it was just a shockwave and nothing happened.

**Interview Tips**
When we meet someone for the first time, they often make an opinion about us quickly. This is because they notice how we look, how we talk, and how we move. They also notice if we are on time or late.
Mary Pearce, a teacher, once went to an interview. She wore a jacket with a small hole in it, but she didn't have time to change. Unfortunately, the Head Teacher didn't like this and didn't think Mary would be a good teacher.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who look nice and take care of themselves are more likely to do a good job. But many people don't think about how they look at an interview.
Janet Goodwood worked in an office for ten years, but when she applied for a new job, she wasn't even given an interview. The Director of Personnel told her that she didn't look like an office manager. Janet was surprised and didn't understand why her clothes mattered.
Our body language, like our facial expressions, can also affect what the interviewer thinks of us. A psychologist found that 55% of what we communicate comes from our facial expressions. So, we should make sure our words and body language agree.
It's also important not to seem too excited or too eager for the job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, got a job offer on the spot, but she reacted too enthusiastically and got a lower salary than she wanted.
Finally, it's a good idea to learn about the company before the interview and have some questions ready. This will show that you are interested and prepared. Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests speaking in short sentences and using highlighted points to make our message clear.

When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I decided to focus on running instead. My biggest achievement was running for my country's youth team and getting a medal. I was hoping for some sponsorship, but it didn't happen. I train at home in the winter and then go to a special place for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun, but I have to be very disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out at night, I have to say no. My goal is to go to the next Olympics.
B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so I see the same people everywhere I compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn. I have to give up late nights and lie-ins, but it's worth it. Without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships. After a big win, I like to celebrate with a big night out and maybe go on a nice trip. It's worth the sacrifices because it helped me get a TV show.
C Dieter (yacht racer) When I'm on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We like to celebrate our wins and sometimes we get a bit silly. We don't try to get in the news, but sometimes the reporters are more interested in what we do when we're celebrating than in our racing. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to go back home and do normal things with my friends. I'm well-known in the sailing world, but I don't get recognized on the street often. I like to reply to the nice letters I get from fans.
D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to play in front of a crowd. At the last tournament, it was a bit crazy with people everywhere. I do get a thrill when I'm recognized by fans, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from other women. As a tennis player, I have to travel a lot, which is why we split up. You have to make sacrifices in any sport. I'm happy to focus on my game now and do other things when I retire.

**Shopping with Children**
Some mothers find shopping with their kids very difficult. They want everything they see. If it's not a new breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. The mother feels guilty if she says no, but she also feels bad if she says yes because she knows it's not good for them. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she worries that she's not letting them make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes when they're in a supermarket. Many parents spend a lot of money on advertising that targets children, especially on TV. Children often don't understand why they can't have something, and the advertisements are very persuasive.
Some parents feel stressed because they don't want to say no to their children, but they also don't want to say yes to unhealthy food. They want to have a conversation with their children about what they eat, but it's hard to do when there's so much advertising.
The Independent Television Commission says that advertisers should not tell children to ask their parents to buy something. But even if they don't say that, the goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something.
Some parents find it hard to decide what to buy and what not to buy. They feel guilty if they say no, but they also feel bad if they say yes. One mother says that she and her son talk about food and look at labels together, so they don't have many arguments in the supermarket.
Some parents admit that they are not consistent in their answers to their children's requests. They might say no to something because it's not good for their children, but then they buy something else that's not good for them either. Supermarkets could make it easier for parents and children by moving sweets away from the checkout area or providing a play area for children.

'The Merrion Hotel is a new, five-star hotel in Dublin. It is made from four old houses that have been renovated. The hotel has the latest technology to make life easier for the staff and guests. The manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests by name. He uses a computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system cost £250,000, but it will save money in the long run. For example, if a guest likes a certain type of music, the hotel can play it for them on their next visit.
Guests can also control the temperature in their room. They can change it by up to three degrees from the usual temperature of 18°C. The hotel also has special technology to help business guests. Each room has a phone, fax machine, and computer, and some rooms even have a video-conferencing facility.
The hotel has many other facilities, including a swimming pool, gym, and two restaurants. The food is very good because the chef, Patrick Guilbaud, is very experienced. He has a new kitchen and can make delicious meals for the guests. The hotel also has a nice garden and two bars. The Merrion Hotel is a great place to stay, with friendly staff and the latest technology.'

'Ice Skating Ice skating has a long history. People used to make skates from animal bones. This was until iron was invented. In Scandinavia, skating was important for the upper class. In the early 1900s, skating was popular among the rich. But in 1924, a 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie changed everything. She showed that skating could be fun and exciting. Now, people combine art and sports when they skate. It's a great way to stay healthy and have fun.
To start skating, you need to stand with your feet together and your knees bent. Keep your body relaxed and your weight centered. You can start by moving one foot a little bit, and then the other. As you get better, you can move your feet more. It's important to know how to fall, even if you're a good skater. To fall safely, try to relax and bend your knees.
There are many ways to skate, like figure skating, speed skating, and skating with a partner. But first, you need to learn the basics of figure skating. You can take lessons at an ice rink near you. Skating is good for your body and mind. It helps you stay flexible, strong, and healthy. You can even combine it with swimming or jogging for a great workout.'

A. Annika Reeder is 15 and won a gold medal for gymnastics. She wants to be a doctor and compete in the Olympics. 'I work very hard every day. I don't have time to watch TV or play with friends. Sometimes I get very tired, but my coach gives me a day off if I need it.'
B. Annika's mother 'Annika was always good at gymnastics. She loves it and works very hard. It's not easy, but it makes her happy. Before she started gymnastics, she was shy and hid behind me. Now she's confident and makes friends all over the world.'
C. Sarah Stokes is 15 and loves show-jumping. She won a big competition and wants to win more. 'I'm lucky my parents like show-jumping too. They help me and take me to competitions. I don't get tired of it because it's so much fun. I want to win a gold medal at the Olympics.'
D. Sarah's mother 'Sarah loves horses. She's been riding since she was one year old. To go to big competitions, we have to travel a lot. Sarah is very responsible and knows what she's doing. It's great to see her succeed at something she loves.'
E. Jane McShane is 10 and is very good at chess. 'I like playing chess with my friends. Sometimes I get distracted and don't think about the game. I don't talk about my wins at school because I don't want to be embarrassed.'
F. Jane's mother 'Jane started playing chess when she was five. She loved it from the beginning. She's very good and beats adults sometimes. I'm proud of her, but if she wants to stop playing, I won't stop her. I just want her to be happy.'

'The tallest man in Britain is Chris Greener. He is 228 cm tall. When he was 14, he said he wanted to join the navy. His teacher asked, ""What do you want to be?"" Chris said, ""The flagpole on a ship!"" The teacher was right. Chris was very tall even when he was 14.
People in Europe are getting taller. On average, they grow 1 cm taller every 10 years. More and more people are born who are very tall. But this doesn't mean we are becoming a new kind of superhuman. Instead, we are going back to what our ancestors were like a long time ago.
Our ancestors used to eat many different foods, like fruits, vegetables, and meat. They were healthy and strong. But then people started farming and eating only a few foods, like wheat, rice, and corn. This made them unhealthy and weak.
Now, some countries are eating more healthy foods again, and people are getting taller. In the US, the average height is 179 cm, in Holland it's 180 cm, and in Japan it's 177 cm. This is good news, but it also means we need to make sure our beds, chairs, and clothes are big enough.
But there is a problem. Scientists think that humans can only get so tall, and then we won't get any taller. They think we might reach a maximum height of 193 cm. However, they also think that as a species, we might actually get smaller again because of global warming.

""Watching TV shows being made is exciting! But have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience? I found out. Many people think studio audiences are just a bunch of silly people who want to be on TV. But that's not true. People from all walks of life come to be in the audience. They come from different jobs, places, and income levels. TV shows try to get different types of people to watch different types of programs.
Some people might think, ""Why would anyone want to watch TV in a studio when they can watch it at home?"" But for many, it's a fun and free night out. Some people hope to appear on TV, while others are curious to see behind the scenes. One person told me, ""A friend gave me a ticket, so I came!""
When you're in the audience, you sit with strangers and follow instructions to clap or laugh. But not all TV shows need these signs. Some people enjoy the excitement of live TV, while others like the feeling of being involved. I saw a comedian live, and it was different from watching him on TV at home. But what's important is that people have fun and enjoy the show.
Going to a TV studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but it's an experience many people enjoy.""

'I like places that have a human touch. I don't like empty landscapes. When I travel, I like to visit old villages and towns. When I was a child, I went to school in England and on Saturdays, I would cycle to a village called Lastingham. I loved exploring the hills and valleys. The landscape was familiar, but different from what I was used to in Scotland. I still visit there today.
I like taking the miniature train from Hythe to Dungeness. It's a small train, and the scenery is not very exciting. But I like looking at the ordinary things people do in their daily lives. I see myself in their eyes, looking at their homes.
My friends like to visit the Hartland Peninsula, which is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach, so there are not many people there. They like to walk along the coast and look at the sea.
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a big, open area with moorland and hills. There are not many people there, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered it by chance when I was a student, and I go back every year.
I also have a special house in England called Glenthorne. It's a quiet, romantic place where I can relax and feel at home. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but I went to school in England when I was 12. I used to cycle around the moors and villages, and I always wanted to visit Glenthorne.'

**Happy Hunting Ground**
We love animals. One day, my daughter called me at work. She found a beautiful snake in our garden. ""Can we keep it?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but just for one night."" We have a special tank for animals that come to our garden.
I was late getting home. When I arrived, my sons were screaming. Domino, our cat, had caught a mouse, Bianca, that I had given to my husband as a present. Domino was running around the bedroom with the mouse in his mouth, trying to find a way out.
I rushed into the room and tripped over something. As I got up, I saw the snake. It had escaped from its tank and was crawling all over the floor. I was scared. The cat, mouse, and kids were all running around, screaming and hissing. The snake was striking at us.
I finally managed to catch Domino and get the mouse out of his mouth. Then I went to turn off the stove, which was boiling over. When I came back, I saw the snake again. It was still crawling around. I sat down on the floor and slowly moved my hands under the snake. It was very long and strong.
I finally stood up and walked to the end of the garden. I pointed to a tree and let the snake go. It slid up the tree and over my shoulders. It was very comfortable there. We stood there in the dark, my four kids, me, and the snake. My oldest son said, ""You're warm and comfortable, Mum, and the shed isn't."" I made the kids go to the other end of the snake and encourage it to move. It slowly went away. As it disappeared over the roof, my three-year-old son said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!""

'Write to me! In our busy world of phones and computers, writing letters is becoming less popular. But I love receiving letters. There's something special about getting a letter in the mail. You feel excited to see who it's from and what's inside. I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. When I was a child, I would write to my mother. My mother always wanted me to write thank-you letters for presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I left home to study to be a doctor, I would write to my mother every week. Sometimes my father would write too, and it was always fun to receive his letters. The letters from home told me about my parents' daily lives and their friends. We also talked on the phone, but I remember the letters more.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away from home, so we would stay in touch by writing. I found it easier to express myself in writing than talking. I like getting letters with birthday or Christmas cards. It's nice to have a year's worth of news!
I have penfriends from different countries, like Sri Lanka, Australia, and France. If I hadn't met them, I wouldn't be able to write to them. It's important to keep writing letters because it helps us stay in touch and learn about each other's lives. My children are also learning to write letters, just like I did when I was young.

'Tourists are damaging ancient rock art in the French Alps. The art is over 4,000 years old and shows pictures of cows, fields, and gods. But as more and more tourists visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by graffiti and damage. The people in charge of the site are worried that if the damage continues, the art will not be around for future generations.
Some experts think that the site should be closed to the public, except for guided tours. Others think that this would cause too many problems and that a better solution would be to charge a fee to visit the site and provide guides to help protect the art.
The problem is that the site is very big and it is difficult to stop visitors from damaging it. The people in charge do not have enough money to hire enough guards. They think that if they can find a way to make money from the site, they will be able to protect it better.'

Shopping with children can be very difficult for some mothers. They always want the latest things, like special breakfast cereal, Disney videos, or comics.

Some mothers try to avoid taking their children shopping, but then they worry that they are not letting their children make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask their parents to buy something every two minutes when they are shopping. Many companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. Children often don't understand why their parents can't afford the things they want. They see attractive and persuasive ads, but parents try to explain that sugar is not good for their teeth.
Some parents are worried about what they feed their children and have ideas about what is healthy, but these ideas are not always correct. Parents and children should talk about food and make decisions together. This is good, but it can be difficult when children are bombarded with ads from TV.
Some parents feel stressed when deciding what to buy and what not to buy. They want to be consistent, but it's hard. They might say no to their children's requests for sweets, but then buy treats for themselves. Supermarkets could make it easier for parents by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This might even attract more customers who want to shop without their children's demands.

""Climbing walls are popular everywhere now. People used to go to mountains to climb, but now you can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is watching. A French climber, Francois Lombard, is climbing upside down on a wall at the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham. The National Indoor Arena is a big place where people watch TV shows, but it's also where the climbing championships are held. The climbing wall is a special part of the arena.
Many years ago, climbers would climb on cliffs in the mountains. But when it was cold outside, they would stop climbing or go for a walk instead. Later, they started using buildings to practice their climbing skills. They would climb on brick edges or stone walls to keep their fingers strong. Then, many sports centers built special walls for climbing. These walls had special edges to hold onto.
One teacher, Don Robinson, built a climbing wall at his school in the 1960s. He had the idea of putting real rocks in a concrete block. Many other walls were built like this, but they had some problems. The walls were only straight up and down, like a cliff. But cliffs have special features like overhangs and angled rocks. The walls couldn't be changed once they were built, so climbers got bored with them.
A Frenchman, Francois Savigny, invented a special material that could be shaped like the rocks on cliffs. He could attach these shapes to any wall and then take them off when climbers got bored. French companies also started making panels that could be attached to a steel frame. This made it possible to build overhanging walls without having to do a lot of building work. The panels could be changed easily, so climbers always had new holds to try."""

""Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone, they might say it's a risky career. And it's true, there are more people who want to be actors than there are jobs available. When you decide to become an actor, some people might think you're crazy. But it's a personal choice, and you have to take responsibility for yourself and your dreams.
There's no easy way to become an actor. You can't pass a test or guarantee success. It's a mix of luck and talent. But there are always opportunities for new faces and new talent. Acting can be exciting, glamorous, and sometimes very rewarding.
I've been asked to explain what makes someone talented. I think it's a combination of natural ability and imagination. It's hard to measure, but it's important to be brave and believe in yourself.
Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain. For many actors, it's the moment when they connect with an audience. This connection is what drives them to act. When actors talk about their success, they often shrug and say they don't know the secret. They know some things about themselves and their craft, but they never take anything for granted. They know they're only as good as their current job, and their fame might not last.
Actors don't like talking about their chances of getting a part. They find ways to protect themselves from stress and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. From the start, actors are aware that there's a possibility of rejection. They have to be willing and talented enough to take the risk. If they don't care, nobody else will.""

But this doesn't mean we are becoming a super race. We are actually going back to how our ancestors were a long time ago. They were taller and stronger because they ate a lot of different foods.
For a long time, people got their food from nature. Women picked fruits and berries, and men hunted animals. They ate a variety of foods, including 85 different plants. But then people started farming, and this changed everything. Now, most people eat only three types of food: wheat, rice, and maize. This has made people unhealthy and weak.
In the past, people didn't eat well, and this made them sick. When people started eating corn, they became unhealthy and weak. They even got sick more often. But farming allowed more people to live on the same land, so it spread quickly. Now, people are finally eating better, and this is making them taller. In some countries, like the US, Japan, and Holland, the average height is increasing. But this also means that beds, planes, and trains need to be made bigger.

""Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules. Even famous people don't usually ask for paparazzi photos. But when they do, it's not the same as when someone important is caught in a private moment. This can cause a lot of harm. But very few people complain to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is supposed to help with problems like this. These pictures are not usually in the public interest. Do pictures of famous people help us learn something important? The PCC should look into these cases. 
The PCC did not investigate a recent story about a famous actress. She was upset because a newspaper published a photo of her in a hotel room. She had a good reason to be angry, but she didn't complain. The PCC should take action on its own. 
Some people think this is a good idea, but there are problems. The PCC might have to decide who to investigate and how. It might have to ask the person involved to complain. If they don't want to, should the PCC still investigate? There are also concerns about how the PCC would deal with stories about famous people and royalty. It would be a big job for the PCC to monitor all the newspapers. And even if someone's privacy is invaded, they might not want to make a big deal about it. They might just want to forget about it. 
One famous comedian had his privacy invaded when he was on his honeymoon. He didn't complain because he was worried that the newspaper would use the pictures again and make up a new story. He thought they would say he was angry, which wasn't true. People are afraid to challenge the newspapers because they think they will be targeted again.

We're not talking about people who are looking for a temporary job or those who are unhappy with their current job. Instead, we're talking about people who are taking a big step in their career, choosing a job that fits their goals.
What kind of job should you look for? It depends on what you want to achieve. Do you want to specialize in a particular area or move up the career ladder? Whatever you choose, make sure you pick a job that is right for you. You should stay in this job for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job.
It's also a good time to travel if you want to. You can do temporary work when you come back and then get a new job. Employers will be happy to see that you've had a break and are not likely to leave again.

If you learn from your mistakes, you'll be more confident next time. E Kim I used to be too scared to speak up in meetings. But I started making my point and soon I was more confident. When I started speaking in public, I would say to myself, ""Many people do this every day, so why can't I?"" The secret to confidence is believing that nothing is impossible.'

'I went to Malaysia to visit a kite-flying festival. I met a man named Adnan who was very friendly. He showed me his kites and said I could keep one if I found it on the ground. There were many kites on the beach, all the same size and made of special paper and bamboo. People were waiting for a competition to start. When the whistle blew, the kites went up in the air like rockets! There were over 500 people competing, and they had to make four different kites. Adnan said making kites is not easy, but it's fun. He invited me to visit him at his home, but I didn't have time. Instead, I went to explore the state and saw some beautiful mountains and a river. I took a wrong turn and ended up in a forest. A man named Baba gave me tea and I stayed in his camp for the night. It was dark and noisy, but I saw a beautiful view in the morning. It rained in the afternoon, and I got wet. But the people were very kind and friendly, and I felt welcome. I remember my trip to Malaysia for its beautiful kites, but also for the kind people I met.'

Some children, between 10 and 15 years old, go to cooking classes on Saturdays. They have fun learning to cook. Many children want to join, so there's a waiting list. Parents pay £280 for the course. The children like it because they can make yummy food and have fun with their friends.
Bill, who is 10, says, 'I love cooking because I can make food better than my mum now. The teachers are funny, especially when we eat the food we made.'
Flora, who is 12, likes cooking. She cooked for 10 friends and they loved it. Her mum thought she should find a hobby instead of staying at home. Flora was not sure at first, but she's happy she joined.
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'Cooking is fun! Children pay attention and remember things better than grown-ups. The kitchen can get a bit messy when they cook, but it's okay. If parents teach their children to cook when they're young, they'll be able to cook for themselves when they leave home.'

But the note itself is just a piece of paper. A long time ago, people didn't have money like we do now. They didn't have banks or shops. People would trade things with each other. For example, a farmer might give some corn to a beekeeper for some honey. This was a special deal between two people.

'Grass is very common and successful. There are many different types of grass, over 9,000! They can be found everywhere in the world. Grass can even grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctica. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to survive. Grass grows back quickly if it is cut or damaged. This is because new leaves grow from the roots, not from the top of the plant. This means that many animals can live together in the same area without running out of food. When they eat all the grass, new grass grows again soon.'

The train is famous, but it's also often late. A long time ago, people wanted to build a railway between Darwin and Adelaide. They finished building it a few months before I took the train. The train is not very fast and doesn't have many stops. Most people on the train are on holiday. The train was built to carry goods, not people. It was thought to be a good way to send goods from Europe to Australia's big cities. The Ghan is the first train to go from north to south across a whole country. When I waited to get on the train, everyone was excited. Many of my fellow travelers were retired and were looking forward to the trip. Our first stop was Katherine, where we stayed for four hours. Some people got off the train and took a boat trip. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of people and a guide. We walked around the rock and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't very interesting - just flat land with cows. But on the third day, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train wasn't perfect, it took me to some amazing places in Australia.'"

'Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It's a big mountain, and the weather can be very cold. I went to Ben Nevis for the first time in February. We went up the north side of the mountain to a place called Tower Ridge. It's very steep and 600 metres high - one of the longest climbs in Britain. We planned to stay overnight in a special place called a 'Carry', which is like a big bowl cut into the mountain. We took our tents, sleeping bags, and special spikes for our boots because the snow was very hard and slippery. Even though some of us were experienced climbers, we took extra safety equipment, like lights and warm clothes. The weather was good, but we were all a bit nervous. Ben Nevis is always a challenge in the winter.
The track was steep and my legs felt heavy. I had to stop often because I was not as strong as the others. They would wait for me to catch up, then we would continue climbing. I promised myself to train more before my next climb. After 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge. It's very narrow and the mountain drops away on both sides. We had to be careful and take our time. After seven hours, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. But we didn't have a clear view because a mist came down. Climbing down from the top can be just as difficult as climbing up. You need to be able to read a map correctly or you might get lost. I was glad we took turns doing that job. After that first climb, I was relieved to be safe in my tent. I enjoyed the experience, but I was glad it was over.'

We were excited to see the builders working, but it was also a little sad because some open land disappeared.

The school is very well designed, so it keeps the sound inside too. If we sing in class, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in the winter, the few people who lived there had the snow and ice all to themselves. In the 1980s, people decided to use the cold winter weather to make something special. In 1990, an artist named Jannot Derit built an igloo in a small town in Sweden. The igloo was called Arctic Hall and many people came to see it.
One night, some visitors had the idea to sleep in the igloo. They liked it so much that they decided to build a whole hotel made of ice and snow. Now, every year, people from all over the world come to build the hotel. It takes a few weeks to finish, and each part of the hotel is finished one by one. When it's finished, people can stay there and enjoy the cold weather.
The hotel is very cold, but the temperature inside is always between -5°C and -8°C. To stay warm, guests need to wear special clothes, like warm overalls, hats, and gloves. The hotel also provides these clothes. You can even buy them on the hotel's website before you come.

Tanya has a team of 14 helpers who watch her dive. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya says safety is important. She trains hard every day. She does some exercises on land and in the pool. She also uses a special bike to make her heart stronger.
Tanya doesn't run because she doesn't want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to get fit. Before big dives, she travels to a new place and does 14 dives over four weeks. She needs to rest between dives so she doesn't get tired.
When she's not training, Tanya goes to public events to promote sports products. She also helps protect the environment. She loves the sea and has always loved swimming. She grew up on a Caribbean island where she spent her free time swimming and exploring rock pools.
Tanya is very happy with her life. She thinks people listen to her when she talks about protecting the environment. She plans to keep breaking her own records and hopes to do it for many years.'

' CARTOON FILMS Cartoon movies are very flexible. If you can draw, you can make it move on the big screen. New ideas and special computer programs make cartoons exciting again for everyone. A long time ago, people thought cartoons were only for kids. But some directors had new ideas and made films that both kids and grown-ups could enjoy. Not all cartoons were successful. One film, The Black Cauldron, didn't do well because it was too scary for kids and too silly for grown-ups. The directors learned from this and made more money with their films.'

'I never thought I'd be acting in a TV show when I started university. I only acted at school, but I loved the book ""The Finnegans"" since I was 11. My grandmother said I was like the main character, Polly Finnegan. I took a year off before university to travel. While I was in Chile, my mom told me they were making a TV show based on the book. I knew I had to try out for the part. She sent my picture to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part! We started filming a week into term, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I got back to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to do my missed homework. I didn't tell my friends, but they found out and thought it was cool. It was an amazing experience. I'm really lucky. After university, I want to be an actress. I'm not from an acting family, but my grandfather was a singer. I've tried for other TV roles, but haven't gotten any yet. I don't know how I did it, because I had a lot of friends and social activities too. When filming finished, I didn't know what to do. I've done two college plays since then. Unfortunately, I haven't been home much and now my first year at university is over, I'm going to Greece with friends for the summer.'

The colour and taste of honey depend on the flowers they visit. There are many types of honey. Light honey is usually not as sweet as dark honey.

'Norwich is a city in the East Anglia region of Britain. It has been a place to live for over 2,000 years. A long time ago, it was a small village near a river. By the time the Normans came to England in 1066, Norwich was a big town. Today, it is a popular place for different religions, with two cathedrals and a mosque. One of the cathedrals is 900 years old and the city celebrated its anniversary in 1994. This made Norwich a city and allowed it to be in charge of itself.
Norwich is a small city with a population of around 150,000 people. In the past, it was a very important city and got richer and richer. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but the city has a university and is a good place to do business. It has many entertainment options, like theatres, cinemas, and restaurants.
The city has a football team called 'The Canaries' and a new shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. The people of Norwich were patient while the builders dug up the main car park to make a park in the city centre. The park has water pools and many trees. The old market is still in the city centre and is very popular. Both the old and new parts of the city work well together.'

'The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every year, the city of Albuquerque in the United States has a big festival. The sky is filled with colorful balloons. The first festival was in 1972. It started small, with just a few balloons, but now there are over 1,000 balloons from all around the world.
What to see During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots. The balloons are all different sizes and colors. Some are even shaped like animals or cartoon characters! You can also take a ride in a balloon over the desert.
At night, the balloons light up and it's a beautiful sight. You can take pictures, but you need to be there just before dark or just after dark. The balloons are also racing each other and there are fireworks on some nights.
The Albuquerque Box is a special wind pattern that helps the balloons fly. The mountains around Albuquerque protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This makes it easier for the pilots to control the balloons.
Practical advice Buy your tickets in advance to avoid waiting in line. Wear layers of thin clothing because it can be cool at night and hot during the day. Bring a flashlight for night events, a camera, and sunglasses and suncream for the day.

She has also taught some five-year-olds who were very interested in playing the violin. Margaret teaches her students in groups. Each group has about 12 children, and they have a lesson together once every two weeks. Each child also has a one-on-one lesson with Margaret once a week. The parents must attend the lessons too. It's important for parents to be interested in their child's lessons. When children start learning, they play by ear. They don't learn to read music until they have been playing for a while. There is a big difference between how well they play and read music. Margaret's method is not meant to make great violinists. She suggests that children who are very good should leave and learn in a more traditional way.""

'Moonshine is a band that has just released their third CD. The new CD is called ""Here Again"" and is a follow-up to their previous CD, ""The Waves"". There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott is now playing the bass guitar, and Tom Simpson is the new drummer. The first two songs on the CD are fast and fun to dance to. They are different from the slow songs the band usually makes. These two songs might become very popular and could be hit singles. The singer, Rob Letchford, sings very well and shows off his skills. Unfortunately, Rob has had some trouble with his throat and the band has had to cancel their next tour. But don't worry if you have already bought tickets - the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob is better. This CD shows that Moonshine can make good music in different styles. It's a great CD, but maybe the last few songs are not as good as the first ones. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is likely to be very successful and bring more success to the band.'

'THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD
In the 1880s, people went to Alaska to find gold. Many towns were built, including one called Iditarod. It grew very quickly and became the biggest city in Alaska for a short time. In the winter, it was hard to get to these towns because the rivers and ocean were frozen. So, a special track was built for dogs to pull sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This track became known as the Iditarod Trail.
It took the dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at places where the drivers could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until airplanes became a better way to travel. But in 1925, a big problem happened. A disease called diphtheria spread to Nome, and the closest medicine was on the other side of Alaska. It was too cold for airplanes to fly, so the medicine was sent by dog teams instead. It took twenty teams six days to make the journey. One dog named Togo helped guide the team through the snow. The last part of the journey was done by a man named Gunnar Kaasen and his dog Saito. Another dog named Balto was very brave and helped save the team from falling into icy water. Because of Balto, the diphtheria was stopped. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the same route as that famous journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth"".'

When we're over Antarctica, you can get up and walk around the plane to see the sights. The pilot flies in special patterns to make sure everyone can see the amazing views.
What if the weather is bad? We have 17 different plans and choose the best one for the day. Will I see penguins? Unfortunately, we can't see them from the plane because they live at sea level. If you want to see Antarctic wildlife, you need to join a boat tour.

Winter is a difficult time to drive because it's hard to know what will happen. Accidents can happen quickly. Fog can come suddenly, and ice can be hidden under the snow. The car in front of you might slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, follow these two rules:
 Rule One: Drive slowly and smoothly. Don't make sudden movements. Imagine you have a cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you don't spill it.
 Rule Two: Always look ahead and be prepared for anything. On icy roads, you need to look far ahead and be ready to stop. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. Remember, you might be going faster than you think. Leave more space between you and the car in front of you than you normally would. Stay in control of your car and you will be safe.'

Craigie Aitchison was a Scottish painter. He wanted to study law, but he decided to go to art school instead. He liked painting, even though he found the traditional classes hard. When he was in his late 20s, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. This is when he started to like the work of old Italian artists. He loved the green and brown colours of the Italian countryside and the bright light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. To do this, he painted thin layers of colour on top of each other, from light to dark. But he never knows exactly what the result will be. He says, ""It's a secret, because I don't know myself."" He doesn't start by painting a certain colour, like yellow, and then add more colours on top. He just notices what happens when he puts colours next to each other. Aitchison doesn't make drawings before he starts painting. He thinks if he does, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he likes to paint people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. If they are worried and want to look at the painting, he can't concentrate. Since moving to London, he hasn't been part of the Scottish art scene. He doesn't want to follow any rules, he just paints the way he can. But his work still inspires young British painters.

He built two bigger cars and in 1903, he started a company called Ford Motor Company. He made cars using strong and light steel, so they were cheap and easy for people to buy. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model T. It cost $825 and people liked it a lot. By 1927, his company was very successful and worth $700 million. His cars were simple and cheap, but sometimes this meant people didn't have many choices. Henry Ford said, ""You can have any colour you like, as long as it's black.""'
