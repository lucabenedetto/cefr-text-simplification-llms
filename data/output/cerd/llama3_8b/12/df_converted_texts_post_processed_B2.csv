'Paying for rubbish bags may seem like a good idea, but it's not always as simple as it seems. In most countries, households don't pay for the rubbish collection service, but the cost is still there. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more the local authorities have to pay. This means that if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce more rubbish. The solution seems obvious: make households pay for their waste. This would give them an incentive to throw away less and recycle more. However, a study by two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that the results were not as expected. They looked at several towns in the US that started charging households for their rubbish. In one town, residents were charged 80 cents per bag. While the number of bags decreased by 37%, most of this was because people simply packed more rubbish into each bag. The weight of the rubbish collected only decreased by 14%. Some people even started dumping their rubbish illegally instead of paying for it. The only positive effect was a 15% increase in recycling. However, this might not be due to the fee, as many people were already recycling voluntarily. In a more recent study, the economists found that increasing the price of rubbish bags by 10% only reduces the amount of rubbish by 0.3%. This suggests that people would need to make significant changes in their lifestyle to reduce their waste. Perhaps other factors, such as income and education, play a bigger role in determining how much rubbish people produce. While charging for rubbish may not be the simple solution it seems, it's still worth considering. After all, free disposal is too cheap. However, the effects of these policies are often complex, and economists need to use intricate models to understand them.'"

Work and our well-being are closely linked. Many people feel undervalued and unhappy in their jobs. Success is no longer enough; we need to ask ourselves if our work brings us fulfillment and makes us better people. We need to rethink what we want from our jobs and how we can make them more meaningful.
The author, Theodore Zeldin, is on a mission to discover how work can be more fulfilling. He believes that work should be a way to develop our personalities, relationships, and sense of purpose. It should not just be a way to earn a living, but a way to live a worthwhile life.
The author argues that many professions are struggling to find meaning and purpose. For example, doctors are often stressed and unhappy, despite being highly respected. Accountants and architects are also dissatisfied with their work. The author believes that this is because they are not given the freedom to use their skills and creativity.
The author suggests that we need to rethink what we mean by ""work"" and how we approach it. We need to focus on building relationships, developing our skills, and finding meaning and purpose in our work. We need to move away from the idea that work is just a way to earn a living and towards a more holistic approach that values our well-being and personal growth.
The author uses the example of hotel workers to illustrate his point. Many hotel staff are highly intelligent and talented, but they are often given menial tasks and do not have the opportunity to use their skills and creativity. The author believes that hotels could be more than just places to sleep - they could be cultural centers that bring people together and provide a sense of community.
Ultimately, the author believes that work should be a relationship between people, not just a transaction. We need to be able to communicate effectively and build strong relationships with our colleagues and customers. We need to be able to have meaningful conversations and connect with each other on a deeper level. This is the key to a more fulfilling and meaningful life."

'Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology'
The word ""broadcasting"" originally meant spreading seeds widely, by hand. It's not just an agricultural metaphor, but also a symbol of optimistic modernism. It's about planned growth and development on a large scale, with the potential for a rich harvest. The metaphor assumes a centralised system with resources for spreading and reproduction. So, why was a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically organized in a way that fit this metaphor?
Television, as a technology, is related to other forms of two-way communication, such as the telegraph and telephone. It's surprising that, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralised ""mass"" medium. However, transmitting to private homes from a centralised unit was consistent with both economic and social structures in modern and modernising societies.
There were attempts to experiment with other forms of organisation, but they remained just that - attempts. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning, as they highlight what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a potential replacement for the ordinary telephone. However, big business and the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards and regulations in 1938, which drove the amateur efforts out.
Television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibitions in the USA in the early 1930s, and was seen as a potential competitor to the film industry. In fact, television was mainly watched in public settings outside of the USA. In Britain, public viewing was the primary way people experienced television, and this was even more true in Germany.
While the idea of grass-roots or amateur television was doomed to be marginal, television systems based on collective public reception were operating in several countries in the 1930s. These systems could have presented a threat to the domestication of the medium, but it didn't materialise. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of domestic sets as soon as the price could be reduced, and given the division between the public and private domains, centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was the most suitable organisation.
As people's living standards improved and they entered ""consumer"" society, the idea of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for most people in Western nations. This is now happening on a global scale. There is a clear link between the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting.
While social and economic modernisation led to increasing centralisation and concentration of power, the break-up of traditional communities produced new ways of life. Mobility was both social and geographical, and both forms implied that individuals and households were relatively isolated compared to people in earlier communities. Centralised broadcasting was both an answer to the need for efficient communication and a tool for producing the ""imagined community"" of the nation-state. The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests made broadcasting the ""natural"" organisation of both radio and television.
What is missing from this account is the positive view of broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources for conscious, informed, and autonomous participation in political, social, and cultural life. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the wars, this interest played a significant role in many countries. Of course, television is changing, and there is a risk that the term ""broadcasting"" will become outdated or inadequate. In which case, this metaphor will be seen as referring to a particular organisation of audio-visual technology during a certain phase of social modernisation."

'Sometimes, despite having many possessions, people still feel insecure. It's natural to want a home that meets our needs, but there's a point where the desire for more things becomes out of control. Advertising often plays on our insecurities, making us feel like we need to buy more. For example, ads might say, ""If you don't have this, you're not a good person."" This can be very persuasive, and we often don't even realize it.
We're constantly bombarded with messages to buy, buy, buy - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and online. Research institutions and universities have studied caves for years, trying to understand their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a fascinating part of our natural environment, and people have been studying them for a long time. However, exploring caves can be physically challenging, so it's often done by both professionals and amateur explorers.
Weather forecasting has a long history, dating back to the 17th century. At first, people used their own observations to predict the weather. Today, we have advanced technology like satellites and computers that provide detailed weather information quickly. But human experience is still essential for translating computer data into accurate weather forecasts. In fact, human observations can provide valuable insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere.'

'Music and Theatre: A New Perspective
Until recently, I thought opera was primarily a form of theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first. This is as it should be. However, I come from a world where the spoken word is more important, where the actor's words are primary, and where the audience and performers speak the same language. In contrast, music performances often have a significant minority of audience members who don't understand music theory or history. Some are aware of their lack of knowledge, while others are impressed by the performers' skills. A great musician's hard work is evident, just like an athlete's training is visible during a competition.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't fully appreciate the actor's skill and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech. However, they are often the same people who attend concerts and appreciate the performers' skills. The key difference is that audiences and performers meet on more equal terms in theatre, regardless of the complexity of the material.
I believe that music can learn from theatre in terms of this relationship. Music performances are inherently theatrical, with elements of passion, humor, and vulnerability. However, traditional music presentation often emphasizes the difference between performers and listeners, creating a hierarchical atmosphere. Additionally, the tendency to applaud between movements or after a virtuosic piece can disrupt the performance's integrity.
To address these issues, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concerts and opera houses and break down barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, a community opera that combined music and drama in a cathedral and then in the town. It was a powerful experience that showcased the musicians' skills and was life-changing for many audience members.
What I yearn for in music is a bit more risk-taking and radicalism, like theatre. This can come from using unconventional locations, disrupting normal expectations, and creating a sense of adventure for both performers and audience. While most plays are performed in traditional settings, I believe that music can and should adopt a more experimental approach. As someone who loves and appreciates both theatre and music, I want to see both thrive and for more people to experience the joy of being an audience member.'"

I'm not a big fan of sand in its natural state. It's a barrier between me and the sea, and it gets everywhere - in my face, in my food, and even swallows small objects. When it's wet, it sticks to me like glue and is hard to remove. But when I step onto a towel or a carpet, it suddenly falls off. Sand can be a real nuisance! I'm not a fan of it.
The desire for a safe and secure home is as old as human history. People have always wanted to lock out the bad guys. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have developed electronic locking systems, but people still prefer physical keys. That's why one locksmith company created a new electronic system with a physical key.
I was nervous about visiting the Tate Modern art gallery because I don't always understand modern art. I like some pieces, like sculptures and photographs, but I don't know much about them. The idea is to let art communicate with you, not to analyze it. The new gallery has tried to help visitors understand the art by providing labels that explain what each piece is about. This helped me understand the art better.

""Every Picture Tells a Story
When adapting novels for film, writers often have to cut out parts of the story. This can be frustrating, but it's also a good opportunity to see what's really important. I was surprised to find that I could remove a lot of dialogue and description from a scene without losing the main idea. This doesn't mean the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's just that different media require different levels of attention from the audience, and use different techniques to get their point across.
In novels, we often use repeated descriptions of characters' traits to help us remember who they are. We also use speech tags like 'he said' to make it clear who's speaking. In film, we can use the visuals and the setting to convey the same information. Stage drama, which is mostly just dialogue, often uses a lot of repetition to make the conversation feel more natural. Some modern dramas take this to an extreme, making the dialogue seem almost too simple and repetitive.
Watching Movies
Going to the movies can be a magical experience. It's like being transported to a different world, where we can forget about our everyday worries. But as soon as the lights come back on, we snap back to reality. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent in the movie, and we might not think too much about what we saw.
The film industry
The studios where movies are made can be confusing places. The Leiper Film Company studios were a collection of small buildings with no clear layout. It was hard to find your way around, and it was even harder for strangers. The employees knew their way around, but they didn't always make it easy for visitors.
Making Movies
Lots of people want to make movies. There are books and courses to help them learn how. Some people even make their own films with just a small camera. Robert Rodriguez made a film called El Mariachi for just $7,000. He became a famous director because of it. Other famous directors, like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg, didn't start making big films until they were older. Nowadays, aspiring directors have to be more independent and take risks.""

In the old days, the council houses in West Earlham were lined up on one side of the city. The streets were filled with rows of small, drab houses made of orange brick or pale stucco. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from the nearby factory would waft through the streets, making it unpleasant to walk outside. As a child, I remember sitting on a windowsill, looking out at the houses as they disappeared into the distance.
My mother was a strict and serious person who always wore a scowl on her face. She was very particular about how we behaved and would often scold me for small things. She was also very alone, even when surrounded by people. She had a strong sense of propriety and would often get upset if we didn't follow the rules.
As I grew older, I began to notice that my mother had a small group of friends who shared her strict views. They would often talk about the Royal Family, the weather, and how difficult it was to deal with ungrateful children. I felt like I was always getting in trouble with them.
Growing up in West Earlham was a predictable routine. Until I was five, I would stay at home and play on the floor while my mother ironed clothes. Then, at the age of five, I started going to school. If I was lucky, my mother would take me on the bus to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at the paintings, and my mother would try to make jokes. I remember one time she made a comment about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying, 'I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!'

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The evening was getting darker, and the air was filled with a fine mist that made me feel like I was moving stealthily. I knew this side of the street from my childhood. There were many houses, each with its own character, like the small grooves in the sidewalk that collected rainwater. As I walked, I noticed that the houses got smaller and the yards got smaller too. Over the years, some houses that were once homes had become stores, and some stores had become homes. I wondered how people lived in those spaces and how they dealt with the lingering smells of old merchandise.
I visited a friend, Rick Gilbert, who lives in a former curtain warehouse. He wanted to make sure his living and working spaces were separate, so he created a barrier using a long piece of corrugated plastic. This created a hallway and hid his office. He also wanted a neutral zone, like a kitchen, where he could cook or meet with clients. To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he used wooden floors and added sentimental furniture given to him by his parents or found at markets.

I wanted to break free from the routine of swimming laps and explore the world in a new way.

Charles Darwin thought that humans crying had no purpose. However, scientists have found that crying plays an important role in our social lives. For example, a psychiatrist named John Bowlby believed that crying helps develop the bond between a mother and child. Many people think that children cry when they feel helpless, but it's harder to explain why adults still cry. It seems that the sound of crying is less important than the visual signal it sends. Crying may have helped early human communities feel more connected and build trust. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering, or to express our emotions when we hear something inspiring or moving. Interestingly, we're more likely to cry when we're with others, even if it's just watching a sad movie. While the purpose of crying is clear, researchers are still studying the topic.

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing big changes to our planet. We know that the Earth's temperature has risen by about 6 degrees Celsius over the past century. Most scientists believe that this is mainly due to human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
A warmer climate means that the weather will change all over the world. This will have a big impact on plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to live and thrive, so any changes to these resources need to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we don't know exactly how the world will change or what is causing these changes. Scientists use computer models to predict what might happen in the future. These models are based on the laws of physics and chemistry, but they are not perfect and have some limitations.
Most scientists agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. They predict that the average global temperature will rise by 1-3.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, and that sea levels will rise by 15-95 centimeters. They also expect extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts to become more common.
Changes in climate will affect many aspects of our lives, including food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some areas will be more affected than others, and some changes may be beneficial while others will be negative. For example, some countries may experience more frequent and severe droughts, while others may see an increase in food production.
One of the most severe consequences of climate change will be the rise in sea levels. This will cause flooding and inundation in many areas, including cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people will lose their homes and livelihoods, and some small island nations may even disappear.

Art and the way we think about it can be confusing. We often focus on the physical objects themselves, like paintings, sculptures, or buildings, rather than the experiences they evoke. This can make it difficult to understand the true nature of art. Additionally, when we consider art to be something special and perfect, we can overlook its connection to everyday life. Art becomes isolated from its origins and the emotions it evokes, making it harder to understand its significance.
To truly understand art, we need to connect it to our everyday experiences. We need to see how art is part of our daily lives, just like other forms of human effort and achievement. This means looking beyond the objects themselves and considering the conditions and emotions that create them.
In fact, many people enjoy art without even realizing it. They enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, which are often considered ""low-brow"" art. But these forms of art can be just as powerful and meaningful as more traditional forms of art. When we separate art from everyday life, we can miss out on its true significance.
To write about the philosophy of art, we need to bridge the gap between the refined and intense experiences that art provides and the everyday events and emotions that we all experience. This means looking at art in a new way, as part of our daily lives, rather than as something separate and special.

We wanted to know why they hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare off rivals. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring it has, then hunting together might not be the best strategy.

The 1990s were a difficult time for people who work in advertising. The economic recession was severe, and many companies were struggling to stay afloat. In the UK, the economy was in a bad state, with a decline in gross domestic product, high interest rates, and a significant number of people losing their jobs. The advertising industry was particularly affected, with many companies cutting their budgets and asking for more from their advertising agencies.
Ad agencies were under pressure to deliver more with less, and their work was being closely scrutinized by clients. The industry was also facing new challenges, such as changes in consumer behavior, the rise of retailers, and stricter regulations on advertising. As a result, many companies were questioning the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and demanding better results.
The pressure was on to increase the effectiveness of advertising, but there was limited help available. Companies and agencies were too busy coping with the situation to share their experiences, and those who were successful were reluctant to reveal their secrets. This meant that there was a lack of useful information available on how to produce effective advertising.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, but it has a long history that dates back to the 16th and 17th centuries. Historians of fashion argue that fashion, in the sense of style and design, has been around for a long time. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies have been developed to produce a wide range of clothing and accessories, the meanings attached to dress have become more complex and significant. Today, it's difficult to say exactly what an item of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.

'Music in the Future
Music has a big impact on our daily lives. We have more ways to listen to music now than ever before. But this has also led to a decline in live music performances and fewer job opportunities for professional musicians.
It's clear that music will continue to be important in the 21st century. But what will music look like in the future? Will people still need to learn to play instruments? I believe that music will continue to be a vital part of our lives.
The music industry is a significant contributor to the UK economy, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in the media. Research has also shown that playing an instrument can have a positive effect on our cognitive development and social skills.
There are many reasons to believe that there will be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the long term, we may see a shift in focus towards more diverse types of music and the use of technology to compose and perform music. This could make it easier for people to create music, but it may also reduce the need for live performances and traditional musicians.
To prepare for this future, music education will need to adapt. We will need to find ways to teach people of all ages to play a range of instruments and to develop a broader range of musical skills. This will require musicians to be able to motivate and inspire learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop important skills like communication, social skills, and entrepreneurship.
Ultimately, we need to raise the profile of music and recognize its importance in our lives. Those involved in music education and the music profession need to work together to promote music and ensure that it remains a vital part of our culture.'

Actors often face criticism and contempt. Sometimes, they themselves contribute to this by talking about their work in interviews. They should remember the words of the famous dancer Pavlova: ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, they often use clichés or talk about themselves in a way that is not interesting. A well-known actor, Paul Scofield, said that an actor's work has life only when it is being performed. When it is discussed, it becomes empty and theoretical. Each play is a new challenge, and the actor must learn anew every time.
A review of a recent production of Hamlet praises the actor Adrian Lester's performance. He plays Hamlet as a young man on the cusp of adulthood, with a mix of confidence and vulnerability. His physical and emotional control are impressive, and he brings a sense of humor and wit to the role.
What is acting? Is it an imitation or an evocation of real behavior? Who or what animates the actors' bodies? These are the questions at the heart of the theater.
One director's approach to rehearsal is to have the actors sit quietly while the script is read, then find the impulse to speak. This process, called ""dropping in,"" allows the actors to connect with the words and bring their own experiences to the role.
The perfect theater should make the audience feel like their presence has made a difference. The staff should feel like they are part of a special event, not just doing a job. The theater itself should create a connection between the performer and the audience. The proportions of the auditorium are important, as they should respond to the human voice and body. A good theater should have a sense of history and human presence.
It's impossible to please everyone with a play, so it's best not to try. When you go to the theater, you want to see something new and unexpected."

Paul Simon was a teenager in the 1950s who loved rock and roll music. At that time, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but it had a big impact on the middle class and older people too. It also paved the way for future rock stars. Paul Simon and other young people in the US listened to a radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, which was hosted by Alan Freed. This show was very popular among young rock fans.
Paul Simon was fascinated by the music he heard on the show and wanted to make his own music. He thought that he would be okay if he took his time and was careful. But, while walking in the snow, he fell into a hole that was four feet deep. He got out, shaken, and realized that he couldn't continue his plan. He had only walked half a mile in an hour and it was clear that he would have to give up.
Qualitative Research
There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. However, most of these books don't explain how to analyze the data they collect. It's a bit of a mystery. We invited some social scientists who have done qualitative research to share their approaches to data analysis. Our goal was to help others understand the process, not to write a guidebook. This involved making their procedures more explicit. It wasn't easy, so we allowed our contributors to write about their work in different styles, such as personal stories or more formal writing.

'I recently noticed my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while pretending to be a dinosaur. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he didn't know much. There is a lot of talk about using computers and the internet to learn, but is it really effective? One writer tried an interactive programme with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought his son might have learned more if he had read a book instead.

Some time ago, a website warned people about the risks of sharing their whereabouts online. The website said that when you post about where you are, you're not just telling your friends, but also strangers who might not be nice. This confirmed what many people were already thinking: that sharing our lives online can have negative consequences. We can share our thoughts, photos, and stories with a huge audience, and that can be exciting. But we need to be careful because the internet can be a crowded and dangerous place.
There were people who went through this process before us, called bloggers. They were some of the first people to share their lives online, and they learned some valuable lessons. One of the first bloggers was a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life online in 1994, and people loved reading about his adventures. He was very open and honest, and people admired his courage.
But Justin's openness also got him into trouble. He fell in love and wrote about it online, but his partner didn't like it. Justin had to take down his blog. Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She wrote about her job and her colleagues, but one of her colleagues discovered her blog and sent it to her bosses. Heather lost her job.
These stories teach us that we need to be careful when sharing our lives online. We can say whatever we want online, but that doesn't mean we should. We need to think about the consequences of our actions and be responsible with our online presence.

Tiredness is a common problem in many countries. As people become richer and busier, they often have trouble sleeping. In the USA, 40 million people have long-term sleep problems. Some recent books have featured characters who have trouble sleeping.
Scientists are interested in sleep and its effects on our bodies. They have found that people need more sleep, especially when they are busy. One researcher tried an experiment where he allowed people to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. The results showed that people's sleep patterns returned to normal after three weeks.
The university sleep research laboratory has investigated various aspects of sleep. They have studied the effects of fatigue on sailors, the impact of noise on sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They use volunteers, who are paid £5 an hour, to participate in their studies.
The laboratory has a car simulator that allows people to drive while answering questions. The simulator is designed to test people's reaction times and ability to stay awake. The researchers have found that a cup of coffee can help people stay awake for half an hour or more after not sleeping at all.
Humans sleep in a daily cycle, switching between four stages of unconsciousness. When we dream, our brain freezes our body except for our hands and eyelids to prevent injuries. However, the exact purpose of sleep is still not fully understood.
Women sleep for about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep. Some scientists believe that sleep is a way to travel through time without injury. In the past, people had different sleep patterns. For example, in the 17th century, people would sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. This break was used for relaxation and reflection.
In some cultures, people still do not have a fixed bedtime. They may sleep for a few hours and then wake up again. This is because they may need to watch over their families or animals, or because they live in areas where it is not safe to sleep at night. It seems that people all over the world are in need of more sleep."

Vancouver, a city in western Canada, has become a popular place to live for people from all over the world. In the evening, residents enjoy walking down the city streets, where you might hear different languages being spoken almost every other step. People move to Vancouver because of its mild climate, beautiful surroundings, clean and safe environment, and good job and education opportunities. Although some people might complain about the rapid growth of new buildings, the influx of new residents and tourism has contributed to the city's revitalization. Vancouver was once known as ""Terminal City"" because it was a gateway to other places, and this nickname still applies today.
Journalists are not good at writing letters, and I think it's because we always try to make our writing as effective as possible. This makes it hard to write something spontaneous and natural. Real artists, on the other hand, don't worry about the effect of their work and can write freely. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about the contrast between short and long words, but it's what makes them so effective.
In the past, the opening of a new supermarket was a big event in Britain. Celebrities like soap stars, DJs, or minor members of the royal family would attend to cut the ribbon. Now, with new supermarkets opening all the time, celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay someone famous when anyone can open the store for free? Last week, a new branch of Superbuy opened, and the first five people to enter got a prize - the first five men got a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women got a bunch of flowers.

""Citizen Kane is a famous film directed by Orson Welles. When it was first released in 1941, it received great reviews, but it wasn't a commercial success. It wasn't until television showed the film again that people started talking about it again. Citizen Kane is often credited with inspiring people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Welles's first film.
Welles had a great team working with him, including a talented cameraman, screenwriter, and special effects expert. He and his screenwriter, Herman J.

I went to Vienna to take photographs. It was my job, and I loved it. I've always been fascinated by the way light falls on a surface and how a single picture can capture a moment in time and place. One day, I might take the perfect photograph. I've been doing this for a long time, and I've had some lucky breaks. My most famous picture was of a burning oil well, and it was featured on the cover of Time magazine. After that, I went freelance, but things didn't quite go as planned. The mid-1990s weren't as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not in a more exciting location. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it.
The assignment was a bit of a coincidence. I had done some photos for a book called Four Cities in Four Seasons, and the publisher wanted me to take some more pictures in Vienna. I had given my own style to the photos, but I knew they wouldn't be life-changing. They were just for a picture book.
When the Austrian photographer who was supposed to do the Vienna photos cancelled, the publisher asked me to take over. They liked my work, and I was available. I was happy to go, as things at home weren't great.
I stayed at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before, but it was different this time. I was on my own, and I was determined to take some great photos. The first day, I just rode the trams around the city, getting on and off to see the different moods of the place. The weather was cold and grey, like the old baroque buildings. I didn't know what the other photographer had done, and I didn't care. This was my Vienna, and I was going to make it my own.
I waited for the right moment to take the photos, and when it came, I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn to take pictures of Stephansplatz. The snow had fallen overnight, and it was quiet and magical. I knew I couldn't capture the whole cathedral in one shot, but I could try to get a good partial view. And then, there's always something magical about photography. It's like watching a blank sheet of paper become a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, it still feels mysterious. Maybe that's why what happened that morning didn't surprise me."

'London's Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a fascinating exhibition of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement. The show explores the history of kinetic art in the 20th century and features a wide range of paintings, drawings, and films. The curator, Guy Brett, has put together a collection that allows visitors to make their own connections and discoveries without any explanations.
David Hockney is a well-known artist who creates figurative art that is easily accessible to many people. Some people may like his work because it is relatable and provides an escape from everyday life. However, some critics argue that his popularity is due to his engaging personality rather than the quality of his art.
The exhibition 'Window-shopping' was a unique show that brought together seven artists who created individual works that didn't fit into a specific theme. The artworks were displayed together, allowing visitors to appreciate their differences and similarities.
Some people may think that analyzing art spoils the pleasure of looking at it. However, knowing more about the art can actually enhance the experience. The pleasure of looking at art is complex and influenced by our personal values and the society we live in. While instinctive responses to art are important, they are also shaped by our intellectual understanding of the art and its historical context.'

'Metals
Maybe, people in the Stone Age were interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for a fish to come close enough to catch with a spear. One of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It didn't feel like a normal stone, but it was attractive. This could be how gold was first discovered. Because gold is soft, people soon wanted more of it. Copper might have been found by accident too. When people realized how useful copper tools were, they started searching for copper ore and ways to get the copper out of it. This led to the development of metalworking, which was an important achievement.
St Ives
As we walked down the narrow, cobbled street to the center of town, the strong wind and rain made it hard to keep our bags from being blown away.

As the grey sky closed in, visiting Cornwall without a car in the off-season didn't seem like such a good idea. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
Computer Modelling
The problem with studying the past is that it's already happened. The people who lived in times of peace and times of war are long gone. The reasons why they settled in certain places or moved to others, and how they lived together in families and communities, are no longer remembered. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas by experimenting on living or dead cultures. We can't rewind the clock and watch the past again. Or can we? Computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and environments and create virtual communities with some of the needs and abilities of real people. We can set rules for how they behave and create social groups. Then we can change the weather or the population and see how the digital community reacts.'

Vervet Monkeys
Cheney and Seyfarth, two scientists, studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, a strange male monkey appeared in a nearby grove of trees. He was trying to join the group, which would mean the current leader would lose his position. The leader had a clever idea to keep the stranger away. When the stranger tried to cross the open ground, the leader gave an alarm call, warning the group of a leopard. The stranger quickly returned to the safety of his trees. This happened several times, and the leader successfully kept the stranger away.
However, the leader made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he gave it while walking across the open ground himself. This time, the stranger didn't return to his trees.
Cats
A recent survey in the English village of Felmersham found that 70 cats caught over 1,000 prey items in one year. A professor calculated that if all cats in Britain had the same catching rate, they would kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, most cats are not rural cats and catch fewer prey. The key question is whether the number of catches is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many households feed birds, and garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, keeping the bird population high.

Buffaloes are an essential part of the marshman's life. In the morning, they slowly and wearily leave their sleeping place, making their way to the distant reed beds.

They spend the day in the reeds, grazing and resting.

However, there is an undercurrent of menace and barely suppressed violence that gives the picture a symbolic edge.

Here is the simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at level B2:
Photography has been used to record various aspects of human life and activities for over a century and a half. During this time, photography has developed its ability to capture moments in time and space, allowing us to see the world in a new way. It has brought us images from all over the world, including distant parts of the solar system, as well as images of social issues and crises. Photography has become an important means of expressing the human condition.
However, the use of visual images to record events has a much longer history. The earliest forms of pictorial recording date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. While we don't know the exact purpose of these early paintings, they seem to be linked to human culture.
Throughout history, there have been questions about the accuracy and status of visual images. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has given visual images a special status. When photography was invented, it had a huge impact on society. People saw it as a way to get a truthful visual record of events. The camera was seen as a machine that could capture an image just like the human eye.
However, the photographic image is not always a straightforward representation of reality. It can be influenced by cultural conventions and can be used to convey different messages. For example, photographs can be used to promote social and political change.
Over time, photography has changed from being a way to record memories to being a way to document history. Photographs can reveal as much about the people and society that took the picture as they do about the subject of the picture. Photography is not just a passive recorder of events, but can also be a powerful tool for promoting change.

Writing is a complex process that requires a delicate balance between creativity and structure. When it comes to writing poetry, it's essential to be spontaneous, but also to be aware of the potential pitfalls. Instead of giving advice, I believe that the most important thing is to read extensively, write frequently, and allow your imagination to run wild.
When it comes to writing short stories, the key is to keep it concise and focused. Avoid overloading the story with too many characters, long narratives, or unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and used sparingly to add depth to the story. Dialogue is a powerful tool that can reveal different perspectives and keep the reader engaged.
Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. You need to think strategically and plan ahead, but also be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances. The more you write, the more you'll develop your skills and learn to appreciate the complexities of the craft.
Finally, let's consider the nature of writing itself. While language is an innate human ability, written language is a learned skill that requires practice and instruction. Children can pick up a language without effort, but writing is a different story. It's essential to understand how writing works and how to teach children to write effectively.

Here is the simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the B2 level:
I have never written a book with more doubts. I'm not even sure what to call it. It's not a traditional novel because it doesn't have a typical storyline or a dramatic ending. Instead, I'm sharing my memories of a man I knew, but only briefly, and I don't know what happened to him in between. I could fill in the gaps with my imagination, but I prefer to stick to what I know. To avoid embarrassing people still alive, I've given the characters fictional names and taken other steps to keep their identities private. The man I'm writing about is not famous and may not become famous. If that's the case, my book will only be interesting because of its own value. However, it's possible that the way he lived and his unique character will have a lasting impact on others, and people may come to realize that he was a remarkable person. If that happens, it will be clear who I'm writing about, and those who want to learn more about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book will be a useful source of information for his biographers. I didn't record the conversations I had with him verbatim, but I have a good memory, and I've written them down as accurately as I can. I've also taken some creative liberties to make the scenes come alive, just like historians do. I want my book to be engaging, and I think I'm justified in doing what I can to make it readable. The intelligent reader will be able to see where I've used my imagination, and they're free to reject it if they don't like it. Another reason I'm nervous about writing this book is that the people I'm writing about are from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from a different background, as they are shaped by their upbringing, environment, and experiences. I've only written about people from my own culture before, and I've used a more summary approach in short stories. In this book, I'm trying to show my characters as I saw them, not as they see themselves."

'POETRY RECITALS
At any point in time, the literary scene can seem confusing. It's only later, when looking back, that we can see the patterns and orders of importance. Today, there is a lot of confusion about different types of poetry, different ways of writing and presenting it, and different ideas about the role of poets in society.
There is a debate between two groups of poets. One group writes poetry that is meant to be read on the page, while the other group writes poetry that is meant to be performed in front of an audience. Of course, this division is not absolute, and many poets do both.
In recent years, there has been an increase in public poetry readings. Small literary societies, schools, and colleges invite poets to read and talk to their members or students. Arts festivals also feature poetry readings. These events have both positive and negative consequences for poets.
For poets who write specifically for public performances, readings are essential. Their poetry is often simple and can be understood at first hearing. However, the printed page can reveal the limitations of their work. Poets who are dedicated to their craft and want to create high-quality poetry may not be appreciated by an audience that is hearing their work for the first time. They might feel pressure to write more accessible work, which could compromise their artistic integrity.
Attending a poetry reading can be enjoyable and instructive, but it's no substitute for reading poetry on the page. To fully appreciate a poem, it's best to have read the text beforehand or have prior knowledge of the poem. The main justification for public poetry readings is to make poetry more accessible and enjoyable for a wider audience.'

**Oral History**
Historians often rely on oral evidence, but it's important to remember that it's not always reliable. When a historian interviews someone, the person being interviewed is influenced by the historian's questions and presence. The historian also brings their own biases and ways of thinking to the interview. This means that the historian plays a big role in shaping the information they gather. Even when the historian is not present, the person being interviewed may be influenced by what they've learned from others or their own emotions and experiences.
**Animal Science**
There are two main approaches to studying animals: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how animals' bodies work, while those who take a whole animal approach study animals in their natural habitats and the factors that affect their behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists typically work in labs with specific species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in their natural environments. While there's a distinction between these approaches, they're becoming more interconnected.
**Social Sciences**
When studying a social science, students need to do two things at once: learn about the subject matter and learn the methods used to study it. This can be challenging because social sciences go beyond common sense and require specific concepts and methods. Each social science discipline has its own focus, methods, and concepts, which are essential to understanding the subject.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building structures. It was an art that involved order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. The Roman architect Vitruvius defined architecture as a combination of these elements. While functionality and purpose were important, aesthetics were the primary focus. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple, functional buildings that eventually evolved into more sophisticated designs.

""She doesn't look like she's going to cry,"" Fred observed. ""That's something."" ""Do people cry?"" Susan asked. ""You'd be surprised,"" Fred said. ""They help out till everything is in the van, then they start crying. They're fine when they get to the new place, but it's seeing everything being taken apart that upsets them.""
Susan remembered the day they moved in, when the piano got stuck on the stairs. The removal men struggled to get it in, and eventually, they had to remove the banister rails to make it fit. The children were worried, but eventually, they found a solution. Peter, Susan's late husband, came home and resolved the issue. The piano was left in the garden while the other furniture was brought in, and then a builder removed the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from the quay, and the piano was carefully lifted into the house.
The process was expensive, and it took months to get the piano professionally tuned. Peter said, ""That's that. That's there for ever."" But forever is a long time. The children grew busier and stopped coming home as often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She should have warned the removal company about the piano, but now it was too late.
As the removal men were about to leave, Susan felt a mix of emotions. She looked around, feeling overwhelmed. ""Are you all right, love?"" Fred asked. ""It's just the piano to go, and then we'll be off."" Susan took a deep breath and moved away from the stairs. Robert and Francesca appeared, watching the removal men. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked. Susan was on the verge of tears, but then the piano appeared, and they all burst out laughing. They were relieved that the move was over, and they couldn't stop laughing.

'Online Book Reviews: More than Just Fun? 
When the internet first became available, one of its main goals was to make it easy for anyone to share their opinions. At first, it seemed like a great idea. Anyone could write a review of a book on Amazon.com, the biggest online bookstore. This way, readers could see what others thought of a book before buying it. Other online bookstores also allowed readers to write reviews.
However, this freedom to write reviews also led to some problems. With so many reviews coming in every day, it was hard for Amazon to check them all. They had to rely on a team of editors to make sure the reviews followed the rules. For example, reviews couldn't be just one word, or contain bad language, or give away the ending of the book.
Despite these rules, some people tried to cheat. Some authors wrote fake reviews to make their own books look better. One author even wrote fake reviews to balance out the negative reviews his book received. But when he got caught, the fake reviews were removed.
Authors could also write comments on their own books, but Amazon didn't always check to make sure they were really from the author. Some people even pretended to be famous authors and wrote fake comments.
The biggest problem, however, was with readers who wrote reviews to attack other people mentioned in a book. When a book was published, some people who were mentioned in it wrote angry reviews to defend themselves. But Amazon removed these reviews, saying they didn't belong.
Despite these problems, most readers took their reviews very seriously. They wrote thoughtful and helpful reviews that helped others decide whether or not to buy a book. In fact, the collective reviews on Amazon were often very accurate, showing whether a book was worth buying or not. The writer George Orwell once said that writing reviews of many books was like inventing reactions to books you don't really care about. So, the democratization of book reviews is actually a good thing.'"

Art in recent times has been all about being unique and revolutionary. We praise artists who create something new and different, but when it comes to contemporary art, we often feel uneasy and unsure. We expect art to be shocking and innovative, but we don't always appreciate the old themes and techniques that are still present. We also expect artists to be special and talented, and we get upset if they don't live up to our expectations.
Let me describe a situation and ask a question about it. Imagine an artist who chooses a text from an art book that talks about the diversity of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This is a simple and obvious statement, but the situation is about to become more complicated. The artist asks someone else to create a canvas and then asks a sign painter to write the chosen text on it in simple black letters. My question is: is the finished product a painting?
In the art world, it's common for artists to stick to one style or genre that is successful. Collectors and gallery owners prefer to invest in artists who consistently produce similar work. However, some artists break the mold and try something new, like Eric Rimmington, who has switched from painting still lifes to depicting the London Underground. His new show, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique atmosphere of the Underground.
In a novel, a character escapes to a remote island to heal and find solace in his work as a writer. He reflects on the value of art, saying that it allows him to reorder reality, rework his experiences, and find meaning in the patterns of life. He believes that artists can find joy and fulfillment by using their imagination to create something meaningful, rather than trying to avoid the challenges of life.

My father and I were driving back to London after a long day. He had just collected me from school and was not happy. I had received several prizes, including the Latin prize and the prize for the best student in my year. My father had also met with my headteacher and was concerned about my future. ""You're going to do what you want now,"" he said, ""with all those certificates. You'll get a scholarship to Oxford."" I said, ""So?"" and he replied, ""And I understand you want to be a lawyer."" He knew a lot about the law and was worried that I wouldn't be interested in the family business. ""I just said that,"" I said. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say."" He continued, ""You have the right personality for it - you can quickly understand complex information, you're good with words, and you enjoy performing."" I said, ""I don't know about that. All I know is what I see in TV dramas."" He said, ""Be that as it may, I think your heart won't be in the business. You'll go to Oxford, and then I don't see you wanting to join us."" The problem was that, like most children of business families, I felt trapped by the family expectations. I wanted to explore other options, but I didn't want to upset my father. ""It's too soon to know,"" I said. ""I think you're not going to want to join us,"" he said, ""and it's a pity because you have the gifts - intelligence, nerves, and vision."" My brother Maurice didn't want to join the business either. ""Anyway,"" I said, ""you could use me as a consultant."" My father suggested that I help the family business during my university holidays and then decide what I wanted to do afterwards. I agreed, relieved to be spared immediate decisions.
In my last term at school, I helped the family business occasionally, but only on safe tasks. I became a successful student, with a nice car, good clothes, and a nice house. When my father came to visit me at university, he asked me to do one last task for the family business. It was important and would pay well. I protested, saying that I had exams coming up and needed to focus, but my father was insistent. I eventually agreed to do the task, feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Simon Costello knew that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in. He and his wife Lois had thought it was a good idea at the time, but it turned out to be a costly mistake. They had been able to afford it only because they had to be very careful with their money. Lois had gone back to work at an advertising agency two months after the twins were born and got a promotion, which increased her salary to £35,000.
Lois had wanted to move to a bigger house with a garden and separate accommodation for their au pair. Simon had agreed, thinking it was a good idea. However, they could have achieved the same things by moving to a suburb or a less expensive part of London. Lois was ambitious and wanted a prestigious address, not just more space.
Simon's daily commute to work was a nightmare, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. His grandmother had always made sure his grandfather had a peaceful evening after a long day at work.
Lois had made it clear before they got married that her career was just as important as his. They both worked hard to maintain their standard of living. But now, their whole lifestyle was at risk because of Venetia, a self-righteous and interfering person who had come to their office in a bad mood. She had accused Simon of not doing something right in a case he had handled four years ago. Simon denied the allegations, but he knew he had made a mistake.
Simon was furious with himself for not being able to defend himself better. He remembered every word of Venetia's angry accusations. He knew that if he had been in his office a minute earlier, the encounter wouldn't have happened, and Venetia would have had time to calm down. He was worried about the consequences of her accusations and what she might do next.

I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn't care about the condition of their homes. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The garden next door, with its overgrown roses, reminds me that someone once loved it. I usually stay inside to forget about the summer, but tonight I'm watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I've cut back some rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms and hands are itching from the thorns and scratches.
As I'm clearing the garden, my upstairs neighbour, Jaz, appears at the window. She's an unpublished writer and sometimes asks me to give her feedback on her work. I have a copy of her latest manuscript. ""How's the writing going?"" I ask her. ""It's terrible,"" she replies. ""No one wants to hear about it. Everyone wants to know what I'm doing all day."" She offers to bring me a drink from her fridge. I don't want her in my garden, so I see that it looks messy and neglected. She comes in through my flat and joins me in the garden. ""You're on holiday, you lucky one,"" she says. ""I should have become a teacher instead of a writer. Writers don't have holidays."" She lies down on a chair and I sit on the couch. ""What are your plans for the holidays?"" she asks. I'm worried about the empty days ahead.
""I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow,"" I reply. ""I need to ask you to feed my cat."" Jaz agrees to do it, but I know she'll be around. ""Where will you stay?"" she asks. ""I'll be staying with my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun."" It's not true, but I often deal with fiction in my work. She asks me what I think of her latest manuscript, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans."" I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, bringing unwanted deliveries to her doorstep. I give her some advice: ""Try writing about nice people for a change, not just yourself."" She's upset and defensive. I suggest she keep a journal to write about good things each day. She tells me to get a life, but I have my work and sometimes go out.

Heritage is important because it helps us connect with the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their stories. But there's also a need to learn about our national heritage to understand our individual and national futures. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity and helps us understand who we are and where we come from. It's like inheriting a culture that has been passed down through generations.
Traditionally, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends passed down from our ancestors. However, with the breakdown of communities and families, much of this oral tradition has been lost. Now, we can learn about our past through places and architectural'memories'. It's essential to preserve and restore these links to our ancestors' identity.
The Fens, a region in England, are a good example of this. As a writer, I chose to write about the Fens because of their unique character. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, and yet, they are also mysterious. My research was not extensive, but I tried to imagine the Fens and understand their significance.
Museums play an important role in preserving our heritage. They should make their collections accessible to everyone, not just through displays, but also through educational programs and outreach activities. Museums are unique because they present real artifacts that have historical significance, not replicas. They help us connect with the past and understand our history.
Finally, the desire to preserve things is natural, especially in times of rapid change. As planners, we need to consider the psychological need for preservation and find ways to handle change. Physical change in our towns reflects social change, and we need to learn how to adapt to it.

Einstein is a famous scientist who is often associated with complex ideas. Many people know his face, but few understand what he did. Einstein developed the theory of relativity, which is difficult to understand and makes some predictions that go against our everyday experience. He was part of a major breakthrough in scientific thinking that marked the beginning of 20th-century science. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new way to describe the universe by studying the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein's contributions were significant because he looked at the basics of time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before Einstein, scientists thought that time and space were absolute, but he showed that they are relative.

Writing Reviews: A Practitioner's Perspective
Frank Kermode examines the art of writing reviews. Most reviews are written under strict conditions. They have a short lifespan, limited by deadlines, word count, and the newspaper or magazine they are published in. The literary value of reviews is often judged by their ephemerality. People tend to believe that reviewing is a job that nobody would do if there wasn't a reason, such as lack of money or the need to take a break from more important work.
However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. It requires a reviewer to be knowledgeable, concise, and fair in their writing. The length of the review is just one consideration. The reviewer must also think about their audience, whether it's a general reader or someone already familiar with the subject. A good reviewer needs to be able to write in a way that is clear and engaging for their readers.
Many reviewers also write other types of content, such as novels or academic papers. The American novelist John Updike, for example, enjoys reviewing books in his free time. He even collects his reviews and publishes them in volumes. While some people may view reviewing as a secondary occupation, many reviewers believe that it's an important way to share their expertise and make a contribution to the literary world.
In the English-speaking world, it's common for academics to review books as part of their job. This arrangement benefits both readers and academics. Readers can be sure that the reviewer has a deep understanding of the subject, and academics can use reviewing as a way to stay connected to the wider literary community and communicate their ideas to a broader audience.
Overall, reviewing is a challenging and rewarding job that requires a range of skills and knowledge. While it may not be a primary occupation, it's an important part of the literary landscape."

Ralph returned to his flat, a feeling of ownership still lingering after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would often come home early, eager to see what had happened while he was away. He felt a sense of relief and security in his flat, where he could be himself without distractions. Over time, he started to see his flat as an extension of himself, a place where he could relax and be himself. He sometimes found a pile of letters by the door and a blinking answering machine, which made him grateful that nothing was broken or damaged.
Ralph often looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the stress of his office job. He would sit alone in his flat, surrounded by his belongings, and feel a sense of emptiness. He would read or listen to music, but sometimes he would wonder why he was doing these things. He felt disconnected from himself and unsure of his purpose.

'There are some things that cannot be rushed. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it curdles. Similarly, our minds work at different speeds. Some functions happen quickly, while others take time. We can speed up some processes, like solving puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if we try to speed them up, they will break down. We need to understand that our minds have different speeds and use them accordingly.
There are three main speeds: fast, slow, and thinking. Fast thinking is instinctive and immediate, like reacting to a sudden danger. Slow thinking is deliberate and logical, like solving a problem. And thinking is a slower, more relaxed process, like daydreaming or meditating. All three are important and necessary.
We often focus on the fast and slow thinking, but the thinking process is also important. It's a way of processing information that is more relaxed and open-minded. This type of thinking is often associated with creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long recognized the importance of this type of thinking, and scientists are now studying it too. They are discovering that the unconscious mind can accomplish things that the conscious mind cannot, like learning complex patterns and solving difficult problems.'

I've been welcomed warmly to a small, well-equipped base camp in a very remote area. There are about 40 people here, including scientists, students, and weather forecasters. We all live together in a close community where everyone helps each other. My school French is good enough to communicate, but I struggle to have a conversation or joke with others. I miss the subtleties of language and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There's no practical problem, but initially, I felt a bit self-conscious. I was worried about choosing a table at mealtimes and was anxious about the silence when I spoke. I still feel a bit awkward when people talk to me. I think the reason for this is not because I'm missing company or communication, but because I've lost the confidence that comes with being good at speaking.

I think it's more important to focus on whether our research is useful, rather than debating the purpose of it all. The key issue is that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why we use it.'

Writing by hand and on a computer can have different effects on the way we write. Dr. Johnson believed that what is written without effort is not usually read with pleasure. This means that good writing requires some effort. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I am surprised that they were not full of corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. This is because writing by hand makes us think more carefully about what we are writing.
Computers make it easy to write quickly, but this can lead to mistakes. Many writers using computers spend as much time correcting their work as they did when writing by hand. E-mails are also different from handwritten letters. They are often written quickly and may not be as thoughtful.
Some people think that computers have made writing easier and more creative. However, this is not necessarily true. We have always been able to dip into books and read only parts of them. What is new is that computers make it easy to jump from one topic to another without reading a whole book.

However, by the 16th century, breakfast became a normal part of daily life. Some people think that this change was due to the increased availability of food. Others argue that it was because of significant social changes. For instance, as people started working set hours, they often began their day very early.

Birds have always been a big part of human culture. We love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores the special place birds hold in our imagination.
In the greenhouse, a little brown bird, a wren, is bouncing against the glass. It's a bird of great significance, often seen as a sign of good or bad luck. But is it just a bird stuck in the greenhouse, or is it trying to tell us something?
Wrens have been a part of British culture for centuries. In the past, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their future. Today, wrens are often featured in art and ceramics in British homes.
Our relationship with birds goes back to a time when people relied more on nature for survival. This has led to a special language and culture around birds, which is still important today. For example, the red kite, once a common sight in London, was once seen as a friendly bird that took bread from children's hands. However, it was later seen as a pest and nearly became extinct. Today, it's a symbol of conservation efforts.
Our fascination with birds is more than just cultural. It's also about what it means to be human. We're drawn to birds because of their ability to fly, their songs, and their freedom. This is a reflection of our own desires and aspirations.
Birds have become important indicators of environmental change, warning us about the impact of human actions on the natural world. The loss of certain bird species is not just a loss of biodiversity, but also a loss of cultural heritage.
Folklore and stories about birds have a special power to evoke emotions and attitudes that are deep-seated in our consciousness. These stories are often passed down through generations and continue to shape our relationship with birds.
The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past, and the mysteries that lie between. Its song is a riddle that keeps us guessing.

'Maps help us understand the relationships between different places and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, such as ""a day's journey"" or ""an hour's march"". However, this method didn't provide accurate information about the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for travelers, it was more important to know where they were going and how far away it was.
In the past, written itineraries were often used instead of maps. Even today, some types of maps, like those showing railway systems, may not show accurate directions. Landmarks along a route were initially indicated by signs, which varied in size to show their importance. The conventions used in mapping varied depending on the purpose of the map and the place.
The history of cartography is a story of improving the accuracy of distance and direction measurements and increasing the amount of information included on maps. Cartographers have borrowed ideas from other sciences, such as astronomy and magnetism, to help them create more accurate maps. The development of the magnetic compass and instruments for calculating angles helped to improve map-making.
As time went on, the needs of map users changed. Travelers, merchants, soldiers, and scientists all needed maps for different purposes. Cartographers had to adapt to these changing needs and develop new methods for mapping different types of information, such as geological features and climate patterns.
Today, cartographers use a wide range of methods to create maps that help us understand and interpret many different types of data. The study of historical maps is important because it provides a record of human knowledge and achievement over time. By studying maps, we can learn about the past and how it has shaped our understanding of the world.'

Andrew was a talented teenager who had won a scholarship to Oxford University. He wanted to become a famous composer, just like Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams, but mine were different. I wanted to be a pop star, for the fame, money, and women. Andrew and I met at a piano, and he showed me some of his compositions. I was impressed by his talent. We decided to work together on a musical. Andrew had an idea about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a philanthropist who founded orphanages. The story was inspiring, but I didn't find it original. Andrew was convinced that his score was brilliant, and his enthusiasm was infectious. I joined in, and we started writing the lyrics. I was excited to write funny songs.

""Language is a remarkable ability that allows us to shape each other's thoughts with great precision. It's hard to imagine life without language, as it's an essential part of human experience. People often talk to each other, and even to themselves, animals, or plants when there's no one else around. I like to think of language as an instinct, just like spiders spinning webs. They don't need to learn how to do it; it comes naturally.
Climate and weather have a big impact on the lives of animals and plants. The air around us creates the climate, and it can greatly affect the landscape. For example, warm and wet weather allows for lush jungles to grow, while cold and windy areas can only support a limited range of life.
The daily weather patterns that make up the climate are caused by the movement of air masses. The atmosphere is always in motion, and the sun plays a big role in this movement. As I found out when I worked as a barista, making coffee is both an art and a science. It requires practice and patience to get it just right. With time and training, I learned the importance of cleaning and maintaining the espresso machine and the principles of making a perfect cup of cappuccino.""

""Art on TV: Why is it that television has a hard time creating good programs about art? Painting and sculpture are natural subjects for TV, as the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, few TV shows have successfully conveyed the pleasure and complexity of looking at art. A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, American Visions. Hughes is a trusted art critic with a strong personality, and he was given nearly eight hours to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
In my experience, dealing with metals can be very profitable. For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. Metals are less regulated than other markets, so with a bit of luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. However, the free-trade economists who claimed that the market would maintain the price of scarce metals have been proven wrong. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are now half of what they were 20 years ago.
Recently, I was asked to investigate allegations against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in London**
Imagine building your own bike from scratch, using sustainable bamboo. This is now possible at the Bamboo Bike Club in Hackney Wick, London. Engineers James and Ian have created a unique course where you can design and build your own custom bike frame over a weekend.
The course is not just about building a bike, but also about learning a new skill and having fun. The bamboo bike-building method has been around since 1894, but it's only recently gained popularity. The problem is that ready-made bamboo frames can be expensive, costing up to £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more accessible to everyone, so they created a course that combines fun with sustainability. The workshop is a collaborative space where you can learn from others and share your own experiences.
During the course, you'll learn how to select the right bamboo for your frame, form strong joints, and use design blueprints. You'll also get to choose from different bamboo patterns and colors to make your bike unique.
The course is not just for experienced DIY enthusiasts, but also for those who have never built a bike before. James and Ian are there to guide you every step of the way, and they'll help you overcome any challenges you might face.
The final product is a bike that's not only eco-friendly but also strong and durable. James and Ian have tested their bikes and claim they're just as good as metal bikes. And the best part? The price is under £500.
If you're looking for a fun and unique way to build your own bike, the Bamboo Bike Club is the perfect place to start."

Self-help books have become very popular. Diane Reverend, an editor at Random House in New York, discovered a manuscript by Dr. John Gray, a psychologist. She knew it would be a bestseller. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand each other better. The self-help industry is huge and growing. It answers people's desire for self-improvement and creates new yearnings. The industry also supports the publishing business.
To be successful, self-help authors need to have a catchy title and a unique idea. Editors look for books that are easy to market and can appeal to a wide audience. They ask questions like: ""Is the author well-known? What's the main idea of the book? Is it universal?""

AMERICAN EXECUTIVES ADMIRE SIR ERNEST SHACKLETON
Many American business leaders are looking to Sir Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer, as a model for good management. Shackleton is known for his bravery and leadership skills, and his story is inspiring many people in the business world.
Shackleton led three expeditions to the Antarctic, but his most famous one was in 1914. His ship, the Endurance, got stuck in the ice and eventually sank. Shackleton and his team had to survive for nine months in the harsh conditions before they were rescued. Shackleton's leadership and communication skills helped his team stay safe and motivated throughout their ordeal.
American managers are looking to Shackleton's story for inspiration because he was a strong leader who put his team's needs first. He was also very good at communicating with his team and keeping them informed about what was happening. Shackleton believed in being optimistic, physically fit, and patient, and he led by example.
Jim MacGregor, a management consultant, says that Shackleton's leadership skills are still relevant today. He believes that Shackleton's ability to make tough decisions and stay calm under pressure is an important quality for any leader. MacGregor also thinks that Shackleton's willingness to listen to his team and involve them in decision-making is an important lesson for modern managers.
The story of Shackleton's expedition has also been inspiring many people in the business world because it shows that even in difficult times, it is possible to stay positive and motivated. Shackleton's team was able to survive against all odds, and their story is a reminder that with good leadership and teamwork, anything is possible.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. It has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to drill into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey. The aye-aye uses its front teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to probe and scoop out its food.
Scientists have recently discovered how the aye-aye finds the insects hidden inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson, from Duke University's Primate Center, studied two male aye-ayes, two females, and an infant. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs on the surface, such as holes made by female insects laying eggs. He presented the aye-ayes with logs with holes that led to cavities containing mealworms or empty spaces. The aye-ayes went straight for the cavities with food, not needing the visual clues on the surface.
The scientists thought maybe the aye-ayes used their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects. But further tests showed that they didn't rely on these senses either. The aye-ayes could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked and even when the insects were silent. So, how did they find them? Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those with mealworms. They can sense the cavity itself.
When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and brings its large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. Dr. Erickson thinks that the aye-aye is using echo-location, listening and feeling for the reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It can also hear the rustling of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.
The aye-aye is often compared to a woodpecker, but it also behaves like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously, like a squirrel's, and it has been observed gnawing through nutshells to extract the nutmeat.

I had an unusual period in my life when I didn't have any summers. Every year, I would go to New Zealand, which is in the southern hemisphere, so I would experience their winter. My parents suggested that we buy a small plot of land there, which my brother, sister, and I could take care of. They said that if we could plant trees on it, we could have it. The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, as my father grew up there.
We found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland, in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees. I had always been interested in land and had worked on sheep stations and farms in Australia. Planting trees seemed like a great idea, and I was excited to do it.
I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, my brother, sister, and I had planted the entire 70 acres. It was a challenging experience, as it rained a lot, but we enjoyed it. We had to work together to get the job done.
Planting trees was hard physical work, but it made me fit. After a while, I got into a rhythm and could plant trees quickly and efficiently. I enjoyed the physical work and the sense of accomplishment.
As I planted the trees, I started to think about the natural world and our place in it. These thoughts have stayed with me and have influenced my life.
I have been back to New Zealand several times since then and have watched the trees grow. It has been satisfying to see the results of our hard work. However, I worry when I read about natural disasters in New Zealand, such as strong winds or droughts.
In 1984, I took a break from teaching and went back to the tree farm for three months. I wrote my first book, Seeing Green, while I was there. I lived in a simple cabin on the farm and spent my days writing, pruning trees, and doing research. The connection I have with that place is still strong, and it is a powerful reminder of the link between people and the earth."

'Our Open Farm: Raising Badger Cubs
When my helper brought a cardboard box to me, I was surprised to find three small grey badger cubs inside. They were only eight inches long and had milky-coloured eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. Usually, they are born between January and March and spend their early life underground. If they are orphaned, they often die from starvation. These three cubs had been brought to us by builders who accidentally dug into their sett while laying pipes. The mother was found dead, still suckling her babies.
I took the cubs into the farmhouse kitchen and kept them warm beside the stove. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but they needed to be wiped with a warm cloth first to feel like their mother was licking them. After a few days, they started drinking from a bottle and moving around. They were very content with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.
However, Willow seemed lethargic after three weeks, and I didn't notice it was a warning sign. Unfortunately, he died from a lung infection caused by drinking too fast from the bottle. I continued to care for the other two, but fate brought another surprise. A local farmer found a single male cub, abandoned by its mother. He joined the group, and I named him Willow II.
Willow II was a bit more challenging to feed, but eventually, he learned to eat solid food. The other two were weaned on to creamed rice and then ate whatever they wanted. Willow II took a bit longer to get used to eating without the bottle.
By the end of April, they were eating a balanced diet of cereals, meat, and vegetables. As they grew, they started going on nocturnal walks at dusk or night. We would join them, and they would play and chase each other's tails. They even started to recognize us and would greet us before going off into the night.
As the summer was very hot, digging for earthworms must have been difficult. By August, they were eating whatever they could find. We noticed other badgers in our field, probably searching for food. We were warned that they might attack our cubs, so we put up a fence to protect them.
The local press took pictures of us walking the badgers, and the response was overwhelming. We started an appeal to build a sett for the badgers, and with the help of a local bus company and building firms, we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. The badgers loved their new home and would explore it before going on their walks. Eventually, they forgot about their walks and spent most of their time in the sett.
Today, my walks with them are not as frequent, especially since they don't wake up until midnight. We still see Bluebell and Willow II occasionally, and they greet us before going off into the night. They have made the sett their territory, and we're happy to see them thriving.'

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer who lived from 1656 to 1742. Halley is best known for discovering a comet, but he also made an important contribution to navigation. He calculated the variations of the compass, which is the difference between magnetic north and true north. This was crucial for sailors, as it allowed them to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley's journey was not easy. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Rio de Janeiro, but his first trip was cut short due to problems with his crew. He returned to the seas a second time and published a map showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map was used by sailors for over a century, but it eventually became outdated.
Dr. Clark wants to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing his route. He plans to use more advanced instruments to make precise measurements of the magnetic field, which is constantly changing. This will help scientists refine their understanding of the Earth's magnetic field.
Dr. Clark is a keen sailor and has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He will divide his expedition into four stages, with four different crews. He is willing to spend eight months at sea to complete this project, which he believes will give him a sense of purpose.

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This has puzzled scientists, including Charles Darwin, who wondered how these birds evolved such an extravagant feature. How do they get away with it? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find the answer.
Darwin believed that living creatures evolved over time through a process called natural selection. This means that the best-adapted individuals are more likely to survive and have offspring. However, Darwin struggled to explain why peacocks have such long tails, as they seem to be a disadvantage. He proposed that females choose males with beautiful tails simply because they like them, without considering their usefulness.
Another scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He thought that females must be selecting males with long tails because they have some other quality that is not immediately apparent to humans. Wallace believed that the long tail is an advertisement for a genuine advantage in survival.
One hundred years later, the debate is still ongoing. Petrie and her team have been observing the peacocks at Whipsnade and have found that the hens do prefer males with the most eye-spots on their tails. However, it is not clear whether these males are also better in other ways.
William Hamilton has suggested that showy male birds are often healthier and less prone to parasites, and that their plumage advertises this. Petrie and her team are testing this hypothesis by comparing the offspring of attractive and unattractive males. If the offspring of attractive males grow faster and are healthier, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose males with long tails because they are beneficial.
There is one more twist to this story. A mathematician and biologist, R A Fisher, proposed a theory called 'Fisher's Runaway'. He suggested that if a female initially chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit their father's tail and their daughters will inherit their mother's preference for long tails. This could lead to a runaway process where males with longer tails are more likely to mate and produce offspring with longer tails. This would vindicate Darwin's idea that females choose males with beautiful tails simply because they are beautiful.

**The Boat of My Dreams**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the perfect boat combines old and new ideas. He designed his own boat, 'The Westerman', using a mix of traditional and modern techniques. This boat is different from the modern yachts at the London Boat Show, which are all descendants of a design revolution 25 years ago. My boat may look old-fashioned, but it's actually a modern design that combines the best of both worlds.
Some people might think that my boat is too old-fashioned, but I think it's perfect. It has a coal stove for warmth, dry berths for sleeping, and a traditional sailing feel. I don't want my boat to be like a luxury hotel on the water. I want it to be a boat that requires effort and skill to sail.
I used to own a boat called Hirta, which was very comfortable but not luxurious. She taught me the importance of simplicity and practicality. When I had a back injury, I realized I couldn't sail her anymore, so I built a new boat, The Westerman. The designer, Nigel Irens, used a combination of traditional and modern methods to create the design.
The boat has been tested and has won several races. Its timeless design and peaceful atmosphere make it a joy to sail. I'm proud of my boat and the way it combines the best of both old and new.

""Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are very popular. Five journalists visited some of these places to relax and recharge. Here are their reports:
A. HENLOW GRANGE
I spent six days at Henlow Grange, feeling tired and stressed. My room was comfortable and cozy. I started with a relaxing day, but then joined classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors were highly trained and made me feel supple. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and manicures. The staff was friendly and professional. The atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic. After my stay, I felt more relaxed and energized.
B. SHRUBLAND HALL
Shrubland Hall is a stately home with a calm and relaxing atmosphere. On arrival, everyone gets a medical check-up, which includes a weight and blood pressure check. I was impressed that a shoulder problem was immediately addressed in the group workshops and individual instruction. The diet was strict, but the food was tasty. I had a massage and water therapy on alternate days. All extra treatments were reasonably priced.
C. CAREYS MANOR
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but a luxurious old manor house with a gym and pool. The food is delicious, but if you're counting calories, you'll have to miss out. The spa has a bath, steam room, and treatment rooms. I got expert advice on an old shoulder injury and received a massage. The hotel is comfortable and luxurious, with a relaxed atmosphere.
D. CLIVEDEN
Cliveden is a majestic country home and five-star hotel. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, sauna, and pool. There are stunning walks and gardens around the estate. The restaurant is highly acclaimed, and the food is amazing. I had a facial and aromatherapy massage. The hotel has everything you need to relax and rejuvenate.
E. SPRINGS HYDRO
Springs Hydro is a modern spa resort with luxurious bedrooms and facilities. The aromatherapy massage was the best I've ever had. The carrot cake is delicious, but be careful not to overindulge! The hotel is efficiently run, with plenty of therapists and beauty rooms. The guests are an eclectic mix, and I would love to come back here again.""

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a level B2 CEFR:
'Natural Talents
In the seven million years since humans and chimpanzees separated, we haven't developed many physical differences. In fact, we're almost identical to chimps genetically. This means that any unique human traits must have developed recently. Our biology suggests that our physical abilities, brain, and senses changed to allow us to create art and other uniquely human things. This is a big responsibility for a small number of genes. It's no surprise, then, that scientists have found that many things we thought were unique to humans are actually shared with animals. For example, chimps use sticks as tools and sea otters use rocks to crack open shells. Even monkeys have a simple language with different sounds for different animals.
These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art. But if art is unique to humans, it's strange that our ancestors didn't develop it until recently. The earliest art forms may have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't know for sure because those materials don't last. It wasn't until the Cro-Magnons, around 35,000 years ago, that we have clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings and statues.
Some people claim that human art is different from animal art because it's non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive. Let's examine these claims. First, art can be both useful and useless. While human art may not help us survive or pass on our genes, it can communicate our thoughts and feelings to others. In contrast, animal behaviors often have practical purposes, like defending territory or finding a mate.
Second, it's possible that animals enjoy their art, like birds singing for pleasure. While we can't ask them, it's likely that they do enjoy it.
Third, human art is indeed learned, but so is animal art. Each species has its own unique style, and animals can learn from each other. For example, birds can learn to mimic other birds.
However, there are some similarities between human and animal art. For example, some chimpanzees create art for their own satisfaction, just like humans. They even throw tantrums when their art supplies are taken away. In fact, some human artists can't match the success of these chimpanzee artists, who sold their paintings at an art show in London.
These similarities between human and animal art challenge our idea of what makes human art unique. While human art may be different in some ways, it's clear that animals are capable of creating art for their own enjoyment, just like humans.'"

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very remote and dangerous place. Charles Blackmore, a former army officer, decided to lead an expedition across it. He wanted to prove to himself that he could do it, and to fill a gap in his life after leaving the army. The team he led consisted of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. They set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of desert, facing many challenges along the way.
The journey was extremely difficult. They had to deal with extreme temperatures, lack of water, and sandstorms. The team suffered from dysentery, dehydration, and other health problems. However, they managed to find water when they were at their lowest point, and they were lucky not to encounter the harsh desert cold.
Blackmore describes the experience as a test of his physical and mental strength. He was scared at times, but he knew he had to push through. The team became very close, and they relied on each other to survive. They were completely self-sufficient, with no backup or support from outside.
Looking back, Blackmore is proud of what they achieved. He feels that the experience helped him find himself and discover his inner strength. He still misses the sense of adventure and purpose that came with the expedition. He finds it hard to adapt to the routine of modern life, and he often thinks back to the desert and the sense of accomplishment he felt.

Technology has taken over our lives. Everyone loves gadgets because they make life easier and give us more time to do other things. However, I've recently had a problem with my word processor that made me realize that gadgets are not always worth the expense and trouble. I've been getting rid of my household technology as it breaks down, and I've started to wonder what ""time"" technology really gives us. Is it just more time to buy more gadgets? I think the marketing experts are trying to trick us.
I've started doing things by hand again, like sewing and washing up. I've discovered that it's not as bad as I thought it would be. In fact, it's quite enjoyable. I can listen to the radio, talk to family and friends, or watch TV while I do it. It's a nice feeling to sit by the fire with a cup of tea and do something useful.
I used to think that sewing by hand was tedious and boring, but it's actually quite satisfying. I like watching my work improve and feeling a sense of accomplishment. I've also noticed that I'm not rushing around as much as I used to, trying to finish one task so I can move on to the next. I've even started to wonder if we really need all the modern appliances we have. Could we save money by using less electricity?
I've become more careful about what I use and what I don't need. I've started to appreciate the simple things in life, like doing things by hand and enjoying the quiet, peaceful moments.

Meet Charles Hurst, a skilled cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. I visited his workshop in East London and was greeted by a busy and efficient man who didn't waste time. The workshop was filled with half-finished furniture and wood in various natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for 10 years and has built a good reputation for himself. People come to him because he makes high-quality furniture with clean lines. He is proud of his work and has a strong sense of what is good and what is not.
Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture that is not well-made. He thinks that many furniture-makers today are not as skilled as they should be. He is also critical of those who try to make art out of furniture, saying that a piece of furniture should be functional and not just a statement.
Despite his confidence in his abilities, Hurst is humble and recognizes that there are others who are better than him. He is grateful for his customers who appreciate his work and value the quality of his furniture. When I left his workshop, he said, ""I'm just making furniture. That's what I do.""

'People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. It's clear that sleep is important, but scientists are still trying to figure out why. There are three main theories about the purpose of sleep. One theory is that sleep helps keep our bodies healthy. It's like our bodies are working hard while we sleep to fix any damage we did during the day and get us ready for the next day. Another theory suggests that sleep helps us learn and remember new things. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to process all the information we gather during the day.

'Eccentrics are people who behave in ways that are unusual and don't follow the usual rules of their society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" We all have our own quirks and habits that might seem strange to others. Eccentricity is about being yourself and not trying to fit in with others. However, most of us have a strong desire to be accepted and loved, which can make it hard to stand out and be different.
Many people who have unusual hobbies or opinions tend to join groups or clubs where they can share their interests with others. This shows that even people who are different want to be part of a community. We all have a mix of individuality and conformity within us. We want to be ourselves, but we also want to fit in.
Some people are able to assert their individuality and achieve great things. Bob Dylan, a famous musician, is an example of someone who has done this. However, not everyone who tries to be different is an eccentric. If someone does something unusual just to get attention, it's not eccentricity. An eccentric is someone who is naturally different and doesn't think about what others will think.
The key to being an eccentric is being natural and not trying to be odd on purpose. Eccentrics are not aware of what others think and just do what they do because it's who they are. This makes them different from people who do things to impress or escape from society. Eccentrics are simply themselves and don't care what others think.'

Linda Bennett, a naturalist, chose ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen. This book shows how animals communicate with each other, and it's full of pictures and stories about birds and their social behaviour.
Lee Durrell, a conservationist, chose ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book made him realize the importance of protecting the natural world and the interconnectedness of all living things.

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the impact of book reviews on their commercial success. Here's what they said.
Publisher A Reviews are crucial for publishers. The Book Marketing Council found that many people buy a book because of a good review. Authors and publishers have different reactions to reviews. Authors are devastated by bad reviews, while publishers are more accepting, thinking that a mix of positive and negative reviews can actually increase sales.
Publisher B Publishers and the press have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to get their books reviewed, preferably positively. Book reviewing has become more diverse and less elitist over the years, but there is still a lack of coverage for paperbacks.
Publisher C Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Without them, publishers would struggle to get their books noticed. Favourable reviews can be very effective in selling books, especially if they come from trusted sources.
Publisher D The relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK is complex. In the US, a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In the UK, bookshops often don't pay much attention to reviews, and it can take time for a writer's work to gain recognition. However, some books that receive poor reviews can still be bestsellers.
Publisher E While all publishers and writers dream of glowing reviews, it's not always a guarantee of success. I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but the book didn't sell well. The name of the reviewer can make a difference, but it's not the only factor that influences a reader's decision to buy a book.

Graham Smith is one of the few people in the country who still makes hand-cut weathervanes. He has been doing this job for many years and has developed his own unique style. Graham's weathervanes are custom-made and designed to fit each customer's specific needs. He says, ""I can produce a unique, personalized item. Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want something special that reflects the man's work or hobbies.""
Graham's weathervanes are not just traditional designs like the common cockerel. He has made a witch on a broomstick, for example, and many other creative designs. He realized that the possibilities are endless and decided to focus on his weathervane business.
Graham used to work as a precision engineer, but he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed at home to take care of the children and build up his business. He has no regrets about making the change. ""My old job didn't have a creative element, but this is exciting and fun,"" he says. ""I really enjoy the design side.""
Graham has created over 100 original designs and works closely with each customer to ensure they are happy with the design before cutting it by hand. He also keeps traditional designs in stock, as they are still very popular. ""People like the idea of buying something unique and handmade,"" he says.
Graham doesn't plan to expand his business, as he wants to keep it small and rural. He likes the satisfaction of seeing a simple shape turn into a lifelike figure. ""Weathervanes have been around for centuries, and people still appreciate them,"" he says. ""Nowadays, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has been good for my business.""
Graham has become busier, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to customers all over the world. He has even received orders from the US and Denmark. ""The price depends on the complexity of the design,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, had a very successful first novel called The Horse Whisperer. Before it was even published, the book was a huge success. Evans talks about how he came up with the idea and how his life changed after the book was published.
In the beginning of the year, Evans' life was not going well. A film project he had been working on for months fell through, and he was worried about his financial situation. He had been without a steady income for two years, and his bank manager was getting impatient. Instead of getting a job, Evans decided to take a risk and go to the United States for three months to research his first novel. He had always been fascinated by the story of a horse whisperer, someone who could calm down a wild horse just by talking to it. Evans met a farrier, a person who takes care of horses, who told him about this phenomenon.
Evans spent the spring traveling across the US, learning about horses and the people who work with them. He was alone and feeling down, but he was also excited to be working on his novel. When he returned home, he wrote the first half of the book, but he was still worried about his financial situation. His bank manager was getting impatient, and Evans needed to know if his book was going to be successful. He showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent, and he thought it was good, but not great. The agent suggested that Evans could get $30,000 as an advance on the book, which was more than Evans needed to pay off his debts.
In October, Evans sent his manuscript to seven publishers in the UK, and within days, his agent called him to say that one of the publishers had offered $75,000. The book was a huge success, and within a week, it was sold to two major publishers for a record-breaking advance of $5.5 million. Evans was amazed and couldn't believe his luck. The book was also sold to Hollywood, and major film studios were fighting over it. Evans decided not to write the screenplay himself and instead wanted to stay involved at an arm's length. He was happy with the success of his book and was already thinking about writing another one.

Bobby Fischer, the famous chess player, is back in the game after 20 years of retirement. He is playing his old opponent, Boris Spassky, in a series of matches. Fischer's first game was impressive, but he is now 49 years old and out of practice. Chess has changed a lot since Fischer's heyday. The game has become more professional, with players competing in tournaments all over the world. The top players are now younger and more focused on winning than ever before. The game has also become more intense, with players under pressure to make quick decisions and maintain their concentration.
In the past, chess was seen as a game of strategy and art, but now it's more about winning at all costs. Players need to be in top physical and mental shape to compete at the highest level. They need to be able to analyze games quickly and make decisions under pressure. The game has also become more dependent on technology, with players using computers to study their opponents' moves and prepare for matches.
Fischer's comeback is seen as a big test of his skills. He is facing a younger and more experienced opponent, and the pressure is on him to perform. If he wins, he will be rewarded with a large sum of money, but if he loses, it could be a devastating blow to his ego. Fischer's return to chess is a reminder that, even at 49, he is still driven by his passion for the game.

Nick Grosso, a playwright in his early 30s, has written three critically acclaimed plays. He's currently adapting his first play, Peaches, into a screenplay. Nick didn't come from a theatrical background. In fact, he had never been to or read a play before writing Peaches. ""I never imagined it would get put on,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the logistical problems."" Nick left school at 16 and returned a year later to study at the Young People's Theatre. ""I realised I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard rather than read because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says.

Volunteer Tourism
Four experts discuss the topic of international voluntary work. They argue that the actual contribution to development is often limited. Volunteers often pay a fee to participate, which could be better spent on local labor costs. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who may not have the necessary skills or experience.
However, volunteering can have positive effects. It can lead to greater international understanding, better conflict resolution, and increased participation in global affairs. It can also create international social networks and contribute to the greater good.
On the other hand, volunteering can also have negative aspects. It can be a form of imperialism, where wealthy Westerners come to developing countries to help, but ultimately benefit themselves more than the local communities. Alternatively, it can be a genuine effort to provide technical assistance and make a positive impact.
Volunteer tourism has become popular, as it seems like a way to make a positive difference without getting involved in politics or big business. However, this approach can be criticized for bypassing the democratic process and reducing development to individual acts of charity. While volunteering can be a commendable act, it should not be used as a substitute for addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.

We all wake up to the radio in the morning, and many of us need an alarm clock to get us out of bed. A good clock radio should have a few features. Our panel, consisting of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five different models. We looked at the 'dual alarm function', which allows you to set two different wake-up times. However, we found it difficult to use. The instruction booklet suggested using this function to set different times for weekdays and weekends, but most people don't need that level of organization.
One of the models we tested had a cassette player, which is a nice feature. You can fall asleep listening to your favorite music and wake up to a quiet morning without news. The radio quality was excellent, but the clock was quite large.
We all liked the design of the overall winner, which had a digital display and a wide snooze bar. However, the buttons were a bit tricky to use, and the instruction booklet was long and complicated. The clock also had a self-back-up feature, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out.
We found it hard to set up one of the models, but once we got the hang of it, we felt proud of ourselves. Another model had a built-in lamp, which was a nice idea, but it was hard to position and didn't provide much light. The buzzer on this model was very loud and unpleasant.
We tested five different clock radios, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some were more complicated than others, but overall, we were satisfied with the quality of the radios."

'Hedgehogs are small mammals covered in sharp spines. They live in many parts of the world, except for America and Australia. All hedgehogs can curl up into a ball when they feel threatened, using their spines as a defence. The effectiveness of this defence depends on the number of spines they have. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to survive without many spines, so they tend to run away from danger and only roll into a ball as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and spend a lot of time sleeping during the day, often under bushes or in holes in the ground. While all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do.

C. Annabel, 26, rower: ""Rowing is hard for women to get into because few schools offer it. Most girls start rowing later in life, which makes it harder to compete at an international level. We also have coaches who don't stay long, which makes it difficult to improve. But I love being fit, and there's a great social life.
D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker: ""I've always loved walking. I walked across Australia, which was the hardest experience of my life. I had to walk 50 miles a day with blisters and little sleep. But I got the record! I had to, or I would have run out of money.
E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer: ""Some men can be arrogant when they're driving. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. Men think they can beat me, so I've had a lot of accidents. You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do earn goes back into the sport.
F. Alison, 28, triathlete: ""I swim, cycle, and run. I get up early three mornings a week to swim. I need some extra sleep on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. I'm a bit tired in the evening, but I love racing. It's social, and I'm happier when I'm fit. Men and women compete together, but the media often focuses more on the men's events. The prize money is also lower for women. But we're working to change that.""

I still remember the day I met Picasso, one of the most famous artists of the 20th century. I was 18 years old at the time, traveling around Europe and Morocco in a van. I was running out of money, so I took a job painting boats on the waterfront. I had a big sketchbook with me, and one day I saw Picasso eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was an 80-year-old man, but he was still very recognizable. I was surprised to see him, as he was known to be a private person who spent most of his time working in his studio.
I mustered up the courage to approach him and ask for his signature. To my surprise, he agreed, and even added a few lines to my sketchbook. I was thrilled and started talking to him. Since his English was not good, an American woman at the table acted as our interpreter. She called him ""Maestro"", which made me feel a bit awkward.
After lunch, my friend suggested that I should try to draw Picasso's portrait. I was hesitant at first, but he encouraged me to go back and ask him. I returned to his table, and Picasso started acting out different expressions for me to draw. He was like a clown, making funny faces and poses. I was having trouble drawing him, but he seemed to be testing my determination.
After a while, he stopped acting and let me draw him in peace. I was able to study his face and noticed how youthful he looked, despite being 84 years old. His eyes were very intense and captivating. When I finished drawing, Picasso looked at it and nodded. Then, to my surprise, he took the crayon and drew a quick portrait of me. It was completely different from what I had done, but it was also very charming.
I was grateful for the experience and asked Picasso to sign the drawing. He said I already had his signature, so I thanked him and left. Looking back, I feel lucky to have met Picasso and had him acknowledge my work."

**Selling Strategies in Shops**
Have you ever walked into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? Shops use various techniques to encourage us to spend money. Let's explore some of these strategies.
**Fresh and Inviting**
Supermarkets know that customers want fresh produce. They often put fruits and vegetables near the entrance to create a welcoming atmosphere. They may also use in-store bakeries to make the store smell delicious. The color scheme of the store can also contribute to this image, with green being associated with freshness.
**Displaying Products**
The way products are displayed in a store is crucial to their sales. Supermarkets use computerized stock control to determine which products are most popular and place them in areas where customers are likely to see them. They may also use ""eye-level"" shelves, which are at a comfortable height for customers, to display products with high mark-ups.
**Spreading Out Staples**
Supermarkets may place everyday items like bread and sugar in different parts of the store, making customers walk past higher-priced items to get to them. This encourages customers to buy more than they planned.
**Attractive Displays**
Chain stores have become more creative in their displays. Next, a popular clothing store, uses a ""boutique"" approach, displaying limited fashion items to make them seem exclusive. This approach is not just about the products, but also about the store design.
**Total Spending**
Food shoppers are often influenced by the total cost of their shopping bill rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets offer a mix of low and high-priced items to cater to different customers.
**Pricing**
Shoppers are more aware of prices in chain stores and may compare prices between items. Supermarkets use various pricing strategies, including ""loss leaders"" to attract customers.
**Lighting**
Both supermarkets and chain stores pay attention to lighting. Chain stores aim to create natural lighting to help customers see colors accurately, while supermarkets use special lighting to highlight certain products, like fresh fruit and vegetables.
**Guiding Shoppers**
Chain stores use different carpeting to guide customers through the store, creating a natural flow. This is known as the ""Yellow Brick Road."" Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use wood or marble flooring to encourage customers to explore the sales areas.
**In-Store Promotion**
Supermarkets use eye-catching displays and promotions to attract customers. In some stores, screens on shopping carts show ads for products as you shop. This is aimed at impulse buyers and can increase sales by up to 30%.

Chris Bonnington, a famous mountaineer, is known for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also explored new routes in the British mountains and written several books. Robin Knox-Johnston, a sailor, is famous for being the first person to sail around the world alone in 1968-1969. He broke the record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking only 10 days.
Chris and Robin teamed up to explore Greenland, where they climbed and sailed together. They wrote a book about their adventure called 'Sea, Ice and Rock'. Chris and Robin became good friends during their trip to Skye, where they learned new skills from each other. Chris showed Robin how to climb, and Robin taught Chris how to sail.
On their trip to Greenland, Chris was impressed by Robin's leadership skills. Robin made sure everyone was involved in the decision-making process, which made Chris feel valued. However, Chris found the sailing part of the trip boring and felt useless at times. Robin, on the other hand, enjoyed fixing the engine and other tasks.
When they reached Greenland's highest mountain, Chris was worried about Robin's safety. He had to be careful not to get too close to the edge, as Robin could have pulled him off if he fell. Chris underestimated the difficulty of the climb, but Robin was determined to reach the top. They tried to climb the mountain twice, but had to turn back both times.
The only time they had a disagreement was on the yacht on the way back. Robin didn't wake Chris for his shift, which made Chris feel insecure. However, Robin reassured him that he had misunderstood the situation. Chris learned that underneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person.
I made some changes to the original text to make it more suitable for a learner of level B2, including:
* Simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removing some technical sailing terms

Apples have been around for thousands of years. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. However, the last century is in danger of losing its apple heritage. 
In prehistoric times, humans ate apples. They even left behind apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In ancient times, people in the Caucasus region stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild apples, very different from the ones we know today.
The Romans brought apple-growing skills to France and Britain. They introduced the dessert apple, Decio, which was popular in Britain. British monks experimented with new apples and developed many varieties. These varieties are the basis for Western apples today.
In the 13th century, several types of apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a favorite dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was another popular cooking apple. However, the country faced many challenges, including droughts, the Black Death, and wars. This led to fewer apples being produced and more being imported.
In the 16th century, Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Richard Harris returned with new grafts, including the famous Pippins, which he grew in an orchard in Kent.
Apples became popular in Britain, and people took them with them when they traveled to new lands. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple seedlings in North America.
In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt discovered a new apple variety, which he named 'Hawkey'. The apple was introduced as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.
Another famous apple variety was discovered by Maria Anne Smith, also known as 'Granny Smith', in Australia. She found a small tree growing in a pile of discarded fruit and transplanted it. The tree produced the world's first major crop of green apples.
Today, apples are grown all over the world. However, most commercial apples come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well. This has led to a loss of diversity in apples. While amateur gardeners have kept some old varieties alive, many have been lost forever. Consumers are starting to demand more variety, and we must work to protect the natural diversity of apples and other foods."

Richard Nerurkar, a top 10,000-metre runner from Britain, visited the Kenyan high-altitude training camp. The camp is located 10 miles south of the equator, near Mount Kenya, the country's highest peak. This remote and beautiful spot has been my base for altitude training for three years. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil until my fourth visit. On this trip, I competed in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where Kenya's top runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships.
I was invited to the camp after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000-metre race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. Training at high altitude increases the number of red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity. This has been proven by the success of generations of Kenyan runners.
My first African race was also the first international cross-country race to be held on African soil. It was held in Nairobi and was a humbling experience. Out of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but three were Kenyan. Despite this, I didn't feel like I had a bad race.
Kenyan runners are known for their simple approach to the sport. They have a relaxed attitude and seem to love competing. However, the least discussed aspect of their success is how they train. I stayed with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp to find out.
The national team training camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mount Kenya. The athletes live among the college students and are housed six to a room in basic dormitories. The daily routine consists of three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. The day starts at 6 am, and the athletes cover a total distance of about 40 kilometers each day.
Life at the camp is simple and uncomplicated. The athletes wake up, have a quick wash and brush their teeth, and then have a basic breakfast. Lunch and dinner are similar, with a menu of ugali, stew, and tea. After the day's running, the athletes take a bath in one of the many streams near the camp. By the time I left, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. I realized that it's not just genetics, upbringing, or altitude that makes them successful. It's the purity and simplicity of their lifestyle, their hard work, and their passion for success that contribute to their achievements."

Advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic recession. The problem is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think in terms of large groups of people and big media channels, but as there are more brands and media options, target audiences have become smaller and more specific. This is the main reason why advertising is not effective.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these will not be advertised brands, and some will be multiple purchases of the same brand. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. Even for things like cars, clothes, and services, you don't buy many advertised brands.
There are many brands advertised, but most people don't buy most of them. According to a report, there are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised, but most people buy only a few hundred. In fact, most people buy only about 4% of the advertised brands.
When you watch TV, you might see a few commercials for brands you buy or might buy. But most commercials are for brands you don't buy or won't buy. This means that most advertising is wasted. However, advertising can still be effective if it targets the right people. The problem is that advertisers can't know in advance who will respond to their ads.
Advertising has to reach a large number of people to reach the right people. This means that some people will not respond to ads, even if they are targeted. However, advertising can still be cost-effective if it is targeted correctly. The goal is to minimize waste and reach the people who will respond to the ads.

'Charles Clover, a pioneer in sustainable living, visits the most eco-friendly house in Britain. Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is the ancient Southwell Minster, a medieval cathedral with unique 'green' men carvings. The second is the 'autonomous house', designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. This house is special because it uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost, and heats itself with waste heat from appliances and body heat. The house looks traditional, with a clay-tiled roof, but it's actually a cutting-edge design. The Vales, who teach architecture, wanted to show that it's possible to build a house that's good for the environment without sacrificing comfort. They designed the house to be super-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise and heat. The house is so efficient that it uses very little energy, and the Vales don't pay any water bills. They even plan to generate their own electricity soon. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, which they only use in very cold weather. The house is surprisingly warm, thanks to its design, and the Vales are happy to show it off. They believe that people should live in harmony with the environment, and their house is an example of how it can be done.'

For centuries, iron has fascinated people and the blacksmiths who work with it have been seen as more than just skilled craftsmen. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected, like doctors and astrologers, because they were the only ones who could make weapons, armor, and farming tools. They have also been celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The intricate metalwork of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was always made by a talented blacksmith. However, by the late 1960s, blacksmiths in Britain had almost disappeared, as heavy industry no longer needed them and modern architects rarely used decorative ironwork. Recently, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. However, much of the work looks familiar and clichéd, with manufacturers still promoting their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style"". You can't walk into a trendy design store without being bombarded with rusty candlesticks with dangling decorations. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and a series of events aims to promote the blacksmithing craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We might be at the start of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths have had their eyes opened."" With the help of power tools, smiths can now shape and mold the metal with ease. ""In short,"" says Dawson, ""these artists now have a material that allows them to express themselves."" The exhibition features about 250 pieces, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. The prices start at £90 and go up to four figures. Most of the money will go to the individual artists, but a percentage will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork. Dawson's own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a standard lamp with a mouth-blown glass shade. ""My style comes from letting the steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,"" he says. Many of the artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are harder and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler by training, says, ""It's magical because it's soft when hot, but becomes rigid and unmovable when it cools down."" Ann Catrin Evans' mild steel door-knockers and handles seem to have been inspired by those bleak castles that are a staple of horror films. One of her designs is shaped like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. ""I love the fact that steel is cold and hard,"" she says. ""And the way it feels like it's there forever."" No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a sense of security as iron. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good, as long as we don't have to look at any more rusty candlesticks!"""

""I thought quitting smoking would make everyone happy, but one of my colleagues was furious. 'Why didn't you stop years ago?' she asked. I couldn't explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to a non-smoker in just a few hours. I attended a stop-smoking session, which was a combination of group therapy and hypnotherapy. I didn't intend to quit and didn't even want to. I had low blood pressure, a long-lived family, and didn't experience any health problems. I attended the session to write an article about others trying to quit, not to quit myself. I told the counsellor I wouldn't try to stop, as it wouldn't be fair. But something unexpected happened. When I was told to smoke, I felt reluctant, just like the others. I think the stop-smoking messages made sense intellectually, and the idea of not being a smoker started to feel attractive. I felt powerful, and it was a secret feeling that only I knew. It was easy to overcome the physical craving, and I only experienced withdrawal symptoms for a few days. I was surprised to find that I could still work without cigarettes. The only challenging part was doing nothing on weekend mornings, as I used to smoke to fill the time. I do miss smoking, but not too much. I'm still getting used to doing things without cigarettes, like eating out or waiting for a plane.""

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel Prize. She is not well-known in the UK, which is surprising. I have been asking my friends about her and most of them have never heard of her. This is despite the fact that she was a pioneering woman in science and did groundbreaking work in her field.
I am writing a biography of Dorothy Hodgkin and I have found it interesting to research her life. She was a remarkable person who lived through many significant events in the 20th century, including the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science. Her work on the structure of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin was revolutionary and earned her the Nobel Prize in 1964 and 1969.
However, scientists are not always celebrated in the same way as artists or writers. This is partly because scientists are often seen as being too focused on their work and not willing to talk about their personal lives. This can make it difficult for the public to understand what drives scientists and what they do.
In recent years, there has been a change in the way scientists are portrayed in the media. More scientists are appearing on TV and in the press, and this has helped to make them more relatable and human. There are also more scientific biographies and autobiographies being published, which can help to give a more personal insight into the lives of scientists.
Dorothy Hodgkin's life was full of contradictions. She was a devoted scientist who spent most of her time in the lab, but she was also a devoted mother and wife. Her personal life is not strictly relevant to her work as a scientist, but it can help us understand how she managed to balance her different roles. There is much we can learn from her ability to unite the different parts of her life into a coherent whole.
Writing a scientific biography can be challenging because it requires explaining complex scientific concepts in a way that is accessible to non-experts. However, this is not impossible, and it is important to make science more accessible to everyone. It is sad that many educated people do not know about the achievements of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, who made significant contributions to our understanding of the world."

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability to find water. She can hold a forked hazel stick above the ground and detect water. Many farmers whose wells have dried up are asking for her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business, using modern technology like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But when it comes to finding water, Margaret relies on her special skill. Her success rate is higher than 90%.
Dowsing, or finding water, minerals, and lost objects underground, is a mysterious ability. There are many theories about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One theory is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers, like Margaret, can sense these vibrations. Some say they can sense water, while others claim they can smell it.
The Wilkins have been very busy in recent years, with a long waiting list. Most of their customers are farmers whose wells have dried up. They also help people who own remote cottages or barns, where it's too expensive to run water pipes. Others are developers building golf courses with clubhouses.
Margaret tries to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She looks for areas with impervious rock and makes sure the water is clean. She also needs electricity to pump the water, so it's best to drill near existing power supplies.
To find water, Margaret starts by looking at a map and using a pendulum. She then walks over the fields with her forked hazel stick. When she's above water, she gets a strange feeling and uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. Her husband also dowses, and they usually agree on the spot to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they do.
Margaret's ability to find water is not unique. Many people have been fascinated by this skill for a long time. Margaret calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment"". Without this ability, the family wouldn't be able to run their well-drilling business.

Have you ever imagined swapping lives with someone for a day? We made it happen for four people. Let's hear their stories.
Amanda, a young mother of two, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a waitress at a London restaurant. Amanda was surprised by the fast-paced environment and the constant noise. She struggled to carry a tray of drinks without spilling them, but the other waitresses laughed and told her it was normal. After a few hours, Amanda's feet ached and she was exhausted. She realized that being a waitress is not just about serving food and drinks, but also about being bubbly and able to handle a high-pressure job. She was relieved to return to her children.
Cindy, on the other hand, swapped lives with Rosemary, a dairy farmer. Cindy was apprehensive about taking care of two small children, but she enjoyed the experience. She discovered that being a mother is not just about playing with the kids, but also about managing their daily routine, cooking, and cleaning. She was exhausted by the end of the day, but she appreciated the sense of responsibility that came with being a parent.
Rosemary swapped lives with Hilary, a teacher at a primary school. Rosemary was surprised by the early morning wake-up call and the fast-paced environment. She helped with lessons, attended a staff meeting, and participated in a nature project. She realized that teaching is not just about teaching, but also about managing a classroom and dealing with students' energy levels. She was relieved to return to her farm.
Hilary swapped lives with Rosemary, a dairy farmer. Hilary was surprised by the early morning start and the hard work involved in running a farm. She helped with milking the cows, bottling milk, and inspecting the sheep.

Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player from Sweden. He didn't grow up in a musical family, but his parents gave him a trumpet as a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music and thought his son would enjoy playing the trumpet. The gift was a surprise success - Hakan never stopped playing. His mother found a trumpet teacher, Bo Nilsson, who taught him from the start. Bo was an experienced musician who loved the trumpet and introduced Hakan to many other trumpet players around the world.
Hakan believes that the trumpet is a simple instrument, but it's difficult to make it sound perfect. He thinks that finding the right way to play with imperfections is key. He has always been a solo artist and never thought of playing in an orchestra. His role model was the French trumpet player Maurice Andre, who also played as a soloist.
Hakan studied in Paris with Pierre Thibaud, who taught him that playing in an orchestra is not the only way to be a great trumpet player. Hakan entered a competition at 17 and won, but he didn't win the first prize. He realized that he had a special gift for communicating with his audience through music. He believes that the power of music lies in its ability to move people, and he doesn't try to analyze what makes his music special.

**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
What makes a good leader? A leader inspires, brings about change, and shows the way forward. It's not just about being tall or intelligent. Leadership is about making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic as you are. A good leader should be able to speak clearly and confidently, and have the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"".
Many people have the potential to be leaders, but they don't always realize it. Recognizing and developing your leadership skills can help you become a better leader. A leader can motivate and support their team, and make them feel valued. A good leader can also help an organization to flourish.
When thinking about leadership, consider the best and worst bosses you've had. The best leader motivated and supported you, while the worst leader made you feel like a small part of a machine and didn't keep you informed. A good leader can transform an organization, while a good manager can only keep it running smoothly.
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
* Find your passions and convictions and use them to lead.
* Recognize your ability to lead and take charge.
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively.
* Don't assume that your way of leading will always work - be open to feedback and willing to adapt.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but also know when to step back and let others take the lead.
Remember, leadership is not just about giving orders, but about inspiring and motivating others. With practice and patience, you can develop your leadership skills and become a more effective leader."

**Films on Video**
Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases.
A. **The Abyss**
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron made a thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine. The film is set during the Cold War. The characters, especially the foreman Bud, are brave and funny, reminding us of heroes from movies directed by Howard Hawks. The special effects and production design are impressive, but the dialogue and characters could be better.
B. **The Thin Red Line**
This film, based on a novel by James Jones, is about the battle for Guadalcanal. Director Andrew Marton's version is different from Terrence Malick's new film. Marton's film is more straightforward and faithful to the book. It focuses on a single soldier and his relationship with his sergeant. Malick's film is more complex, but Marton's has its moments, like a powerful flashback scene.
C. **On Guard**
This swashbuckler is loosely based on a novel by Paul Feval. It's a fun and watchable film with a great villain and exciting action scenes. The actors, including Vincent Perez and Daniel Auteuil, do a good job.
D. **Character**
This film is set in 19th-century Rotterdam and is about a brutal bailiff and his son. The film's attention to detail makes it look like a museum piece, but the story is not as strong as it could be.
E. **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This digitally re-mastered video release shows off director Leone's craftsmanship. The sound editing is impressive, and the music is magnificent. The story is cruel, but the film's atmosphere is exciting.
F. **The Longest Day**
This war epic, directed by four directors, features 48 international stars and 23,000 extras. The film is impressive, but it's too long and feels like it was meant for the big screen. Panned and scanned on video, it's not as good as it could be.

BOOK A Steve Martin's new book is very interesting. The main character, a lawyer, has to defend his boss's wife who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial is very exciting, and the outcome is not certain until the end. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
BOOK B Curtains for the Cardinal is a thrilling story about politics and murder in the Italian Renaissance. The main character, Sigismondo, is a troubleshooter who gets involved in a complex plot. Although the book is a bit too long, it's still very enjoyable.
BOOK C File Under: Deceased introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, a tax inspector who becomes involved in a murder investigation. Despite facing many challenges, Leah is a strong and capable detective. This is a fresh and exciting addition to the detective genre.
BOOK D Double Deuce is a great book by Robert B. Parker. It's about his famous detective, Spenser, who helps his friend Hawk to clean up a troubled neighborhood in Boston. The book has fast-paced dialogue and exciting action.
BOOK E False Prophet is a mystery novel by Faye Kellermann. It's about two detectives who investigate a burglary at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's writing style is easy to follow, and the story is engaging and entertaining.
BOOK F Blood Red, Snow White is a suspense novel by a husband-and-wife team. The story is about a lawyer who defends a female client and becomes embroiled in a complex plot involving romance, money, and violence.
BOOK G Dead for a Ducat is a comedy by Simon Shaw. It's about an actor who becomes the target of a murder plot while filming a movie. The book is entertaining, but not up to Simon Shaw's usual high standard.
BOOK H Fall Down Easy is a detective novel by Lawrence Gough. It's about a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The book builds up tension slowly and features a well-portrayed, disturbed robber. This is one of Lawrence Gough's best books.

At 34, Tim Pozzi has left his job to go backpacking. He's thinking about why he and others of his age have decided to take the leap. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat and travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm nervous. I've done some traveling before, but this time I'm on my own. I've been feeling trapped in my daily routine and I've realized that I've been sacrificing my own happiness for a steady income.
I've got no ties, unlike many of my friends who are now married with children. They might not want to swap places with me, but they envy my freedom. I'm not in a relationship and I don't have any big career ambitions. I feel like I have to make the most of this freedom, not just for myself but for my friends too.
I'm nervous because I have to make arrangements, like finding someone to live in my flat and organizing the letting. I also have to decide where to go. I'm a bit of a procrastinator and I'm already behind schedule. I've told myself to enjoy the summer in England and then maybe wait until the football season starts. But deep down, I'm worried about going back to a simpler way of life. Will I be able to adjust to it? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers?
It's not just me who's thinking about this. Many Britons in their late 20s and 30s are leaving their comfortable lives behind to travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that people are realizing that adventure is available to them at any time. They just need to be brave enough and organized enough to take the leap.
For some, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. For others, it's a way to reassess their lives and figure out what they really want. Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is heading to Central America for a year. He says it's not about running away, but about running towards something. He's a bit nervous about leaving behind his comfortable routine, but he's excited for the adventure.
I'm not sure I'd be doing this if I hadn't had a catalyst, like finding my boss so unbearable. But now I'm looking forward to the next 12 months and the sense of excitement and freedom that comes with it."

I decided to take a career break from journalism and felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. I was 37 and realized I needed to get back to work quickly. My CV showed that I was stuck in the 1980s, when typing on a typewriter was the norm. I didn't have experience with computers, and most job ads asked for skills in desktop publishing, which I didn't have. I thought I had a better chance of teaching nuclear physics than using a computer. I was the family's tech-phobe, even finding pocket calculators confusing. I knew I had to act fast to revive my career.
I entered a competition and won a computer package, which included a laptop and a personal computer for my family. We all learned to use the computer together, and soon we were chatting with people all over the world via the internet. My children were already familiar with computers from school, but I was hesitant, worried that I would delete all my work if I pressed the wrong button. However, I persevered and learned the basics. I started freelancing for a magazine and soon realized that working from home was the best of both worlds.
The computer has helped me become a more organized worker. I no longer lose important documents, and spreadsheets help me keep track of my income and expenses. I can research stories online, ask for information, and discuss my work with others from around the world. However, there are also challenges, such as feeling isolated and dealing with distractions at home. Despite these challenges, many people are now working from home, and I am part of this growing trend. According to a report, 38% of people own a computer, and 50% have a modem. I am ahead of the curve, and who knows, maybe one day I'll be publishing my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless.

The National Museum of Scotland is a modern building in Edinburgh with a unique design. The exterior is striking, with a large tower and cheese-wedge-shaped buildings. The museum's contents are just as impressive. The exhibitions are designed to tell the story of Scotland's history, with a focus on specific objects and a chronological timeline. The museum does not prioritize national pride, but instead aims to make the exhibits interesting and engaging for visitors. The head of exhibitions, Dr. David Clarke, is a purist who believes in presenting the truth about the past, without relying on imagination or mock-ups. The museum uses a combination of explanation panels, captions, and multimedia displays to tell the stories behind the objects.
The museum's design is also notable, with galleries of different sizes and shapes, natural light, and wood-panelled walls. The Junior Board, a group of children from all over Scotland, had a say in the design of the Discovery Centre, a hands-on area for children. The museum also has a temporary exhibition on the top floor, featuring objects that have had a significant impact on Scottish life in the 20th century. Overall, the museum aims to provide a vivid and engaging experience for visitors.

""The end of print newspapers may not happen as quickly as some people think. While some people might be excited about the idea of change, others might be worried or uncertain. Transition means moving from one place to another, but in the case of newspapers, it's not always a smooth process. Some people think that newspapers will eventually switch to the online world, but it's not as simple as that. Newspaper sales are declining, but website visits are increasing. However, there are some exceptions. The World Association of Newspapers reported that global circulation rose by 1.1% last year. In some countries, like Asia, newspaper sales are actually increasing. News and current affairs magazines are also doing well, with a 5.4% increase in sales. The same is true for books, where e-readers are popular, but physical book sales are only slightly down. Some people think that young people are abandoning newspaper-reading, but the latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people between 15 and 35 still follow main national dailies. Different countries have different experiences, too. In some countries, like Germany and France, newspaper sales are not declining as much as in others. The way newspapers make money is also changing. Online advertising is not as lucrative as expected, and many newspapers are now charging readers for access to their content. However, offering both print and digital access together seems to be the most effective way to attract paying readers. Print advertising is still much more profitable than online advertising, but maintaining both a print and digital presence is challenging and expensive. Newspaper brands still have a strong reputation in print, but it's harder to get noticed online.""

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with someone in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging because you need to consider their actions, gestures, and expressions. You also need to be aware of how the camera can affect them.
**Group Shots**
When taking a group shot, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front to make it easier to see everyone's faces.
**Posing for Pictures**
People often stiffen up when being photographed. Try to make them feel comfortable by suggesting they relax. You can ask them to fold their arms or put their hands in their pockets.
**The Right Approach**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can create tension and hostility. Most people are willing to have their picture taken and are flattered by it. However, they may become self-conscious and need direction.
**Eye Contact**
A picture gains impact when the subject looks directly at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. You can remind them to do this just before taking the picture.
**Candid Concentration**
An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can be easier for them and create a more natural expression.
**Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures can tell us more about the subject than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiling, winking, or shrugging.
**Situation Interest**
The background or environment can add interest to a picture. Try to exclude irrelevant details and blur them if necessary. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
**Interaction**
When photographing people interacting, look for eye contact, physical contact, or reactions to each other. This can create a more dynamic picture.
**People and Places**
When taking pictures of people in a specific location, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to include the background. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so that they form a foreground interest without obscuring the background.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear picture to remember someone, you may want to ask them to pose. However, candid pictures of events can be more lively and unselfconscious.

Sarah doesn't think the artist is important, only the work. She is very humble and doesn't like to draw attention to herself.
Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for 16 years. Before that, she studied drawing and illustration. She used to work in a publishing house, but she didn't find it satisfying. Then she met a specialist decorator, Jim Smart, who asked her to do a trompe-l'oeil painting. She loved it and decided to become a trompe-l'oeil artist on her own.
Sarah's skills as an illustrator helped her with trompe-l'oeil. She is very observant and notices details. She believes that trompe-l'oeil is all about observation. Sarah thinks that no one can teach you trompe-l'oeil, it's something you learn through experience.
Sarah is still learning and is not afraid to admit her mistakes. She is also honest about her limitations. She once got a big commission to paint a ceiling at Lulworth Castle, but she got confused with the measurements. She realized she wasn't Michelangelo and shouldn't try to be.
Sarah's work is very good and she has many clients. She often works on architectural settings, like painting a dining room that looks like a Venetian palace. She thinks trompe-l'oeil has to be clever and personal to the client. She loves working with clients and getting to know them.

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**
In today's workplace, being intelligent is no longer enough. Employers are looking for people who can work well with others, communicate effectively, and manage their emotions. This is what we call emotional intelligence. It's not just about being clever or having the right qualifications. It's about having the right 'people skills'.
Emotional intelligence includes qualities like self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. It's not just about being nice, but about being able to manage your emotions and use them to achieve your goals. It's about being able to work well with others, even when things get tough.
More and more companies are recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence. They're looking for employees who can work together effectively, communicate clearly, and manage their emotions. This is especially important in today's fast-paced, ever-changing work environment.
The good news is that emotional intelligence can be developed and improved over time. With practice and experience, we can become more self-aware, more empathetic, and more effective communicators. This is especially important in a world where job security is no longer a guarantee.
In short, emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success, but it's an essential skill for anyone who wants to succeed in today's workplace."

Research shows that many people would take pictures or videos of a news event if they saw one. As a result, user-generated content (UGC) will play a big role in the future of the media.

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been around for over 2,000 years. It involves inserting fine needles into the skin to stimulate the body's energy, or Qi. Practitioners believe that Qi flows through the body along specific pathways, or meridians, and that imbalances in Qi can cause illness.
During a consultation, an acupuncturist will examine the patient's pulse, tongue, and overall health, as well as ask about their medical history and lifestyle. They will then insert needles into specific points along the meridians to restore balance to the Qi.
Acupuncture is often used to treat chronic pain, such as back pain, arthritis, and headaches. Some people also use it to manage pain after surgery or during childbirth. While some doctors in the West are skeptical about acupuncture, many have found it to be effective for pain relief.
In China, acupuncture is used not only for pain relief but also as a form of anesthesia during surgery. The needles are inserted into specific points to numb the area, allowing patients to feel less pain during the procedure. This approach has been shown to be effective and has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia.
While some people may be skeptical about acupuncture, many have found it to be a helpful treatment for chronic pain. Acupuncturists believe that it can bring about deep changes that lead to a longer-lasting cure, but this is difficult to measure in scientific studies. When choosing an acupuncturist, it's important to find one who is qualified and experienced, and to consult with a medical doctor if necessary.

""The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst: Handwriting Analysis Gaining Popularity
In some countries, when applying for a job, you might be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. It's not just your qualifications and experience that count, but also your handwriting. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a recognized science that can reveal a person's character, health, and even potential. Researchers believe it can be a useful tool in identifying certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and in understanding psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Many companies now employ graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential candidates for key positions. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain skeptical about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics, medical conditions, and even potential criminal tendencies.
According to Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing whether someone is honest, manipulative, or reliable. She can also predict whether someone is about to become violent or is under pressure. Handwriting can even reveal whether someone is prone to suicide or has heart or lung problems.
Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to become a skilled graphologist, combining both technical knowledge and empathy. She believes that more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientifically recognized field. However, some psychiatrists are critical of the claims made by graphologists, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic ability, and writing style, and has no deeper significance.""

'Chewing Gum Culture: A Story of an Ancient Custom
Chewing gum is a popular habit that has been around for thousands of years. In ancient Greece, people chewed a resin from the mastic tree to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Later, American colonists followed the example of Native Americans and chewed resin from spruce trees.
The modern chewing gum industry began in the 1860s when a milky substance called chicle was discovered in the Central American rainforest. Chicle made the gum smoother and more satisfying to chew. However, attempts to grow chicle commercially have failed.
Today, most chewing gum is made synthetically, with added pine resin and softeners to improve the taste and texture. Despite the growth of the chewing gum industry, the people who gather chicle, called chicleros, face many challenges. They must trek through the forest, avoiding snakes and insects, to tap the sapodilla tree. The work is physically demanding and the conditions are harsh.
The demand for chicle has decreased significantly in recent years, and the chicleros are worried about their livelihood. In response, manufacturers have turned to synthetic alternatives to reduce costs and meet demand.
Chewing gum has many benefits, including helping to reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms on our teeth, but our saliva can neutralize it and supply minerals like calcium and fluoride. Chewing gum can increase saliva production, which can help prevent tooth decay. Researchers are constantly working on new textures and flavors, and many manufacturers use glycerine and other vegetable oil products to improve the gum base.'

When they arrived at the reception, the receptionist told them that they didn't have a record of their booking. It turned out that many of the hotel's 15 rooms were empty that night.
Sue was not happy with the room she was shown. It was stuffy and had a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. When she met the hotel's general manager, Robin Greaves, she told him about her concerns. He apologized for the unpleasant smell in the main lounge and promised to fix the plumbing.
Despite the hotel's problems, Sue found some things to praise. The assistant manager, Emma, and the waitress, Trudy, were helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel's food was also good, which helped to maintain its two-rosette rating.
Sue's job is to help hotels improve by pointing out their mistakes. She has to write a report about her visit and tell the hotel what they need to do to improve. The hotel has to pay for this service, but it's worth it because it helps them to become a better hotel. Sue is not easy to please, but she is fair and wants to help hotels succeed.

**Seven Summits: A Climber's Journey**
I, Doug Scott, share my experience of climbing the highest peaks on each continent. I will tell you about each mountain in the order I climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
We were in a snow cave, 91m below the summit, when my partner Dougal Haston started talking to our equipment officer, Dave Clark. I thought it was strange, as only the three of us were there. I realized later that it was due to the high altitude. We were worried about the quality of our survival, not just our physical survival. After two days, I relived our time on the summit ridge. I realized that I couldn't have been with a better partner than Dougal. He inspired confidence in me, and I felt calm, knowing that everything would work out. I had to get a better rhythm going to reach the summit, which I did.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
This mountain is considered the most treacherous in the world. Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying our equipment and food to the base. We realized the enormity of our task only after the first day of climbing. We decided to climb 'alpine style', carrying all our gear and food with us. It was the first time a major new route had been climbed this way. We climbed up an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff and spent the third night on a windswept ridge. We were both suffering, but we finally reached the summit and back down again.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, my friend Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. We ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead, thanks to an unexpected offer. On our approach, we got lost in the jungle and had to find a rock pool to get water. We attempted a direct start to the breach wall, but it was too dangerous, so we took the Umbwe route to the surrealistic summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
The standard route up Aconcagua is easy, but we decided to take a more challenging route with a guide and his party. We spent three days waiting for bad weather to pass, then left base camp. We crossed the Polish Glacier, which was swept by strong winds and glistened with pure ice. We had to make a quick ascent to reach the summit and camp outside the refuge before dark.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
Climbing Vinson Massif was a reality check for me. Our team traveled to the South Pole and climbed the mountain in December 1992. The weather was harsh, with strong winds and temperatures below -50°C. We reached the summit in 8 hours, but the visibility was poor due to the storm.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
Our team assembled in St Petersburg and climbed Elbrus in the summer of 1994. We took a cableway to 3,900m, then walked to the refuge at 4,200m. The next day, we crossed open slopes and reached the summit, but there was another kilometer-long ridge to the actual summit. We returned to the refuge and descended the next day.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
Our expedition to Carstensz aimed to establish a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. We had been warned about bandits, but we were not deterred. We left our hut and walked to the jungle, then climbed to the summit. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit.
I hope this simplified text meets your requirements."
