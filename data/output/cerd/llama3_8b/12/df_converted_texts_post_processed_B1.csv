'Paying for rubbish bags: a good idea or not?
In many countries, people throw away a lot of rubbish. Some people think it's a good idea to make people pay for each bag of rubbish they throw away. This might seem like a good way to reduce the amount of rubbish we produce. But it's not that simple.
In some towns in the United States, people have been paying for rubbish bags. The idea is that if people have to pay for each bag, they will think twice before throwing things away and will try to recycle more. But it's not working as well as expected.
In one town, people were charged 80 cents for each rubbish bag. At first, people threw away fewer bags, but then they started putting more rubbish in each bag. This made it harder for the rubbish collectors to do their job. Some people even started dumping their rubbish illegally.
The only good thing that happened was that more people started recycling. But this might not have been because of the new system. Some people were already recycling before the new system was introduced.
The researchers who studied this found that making people pay for rubbish bags doesn't really make a big difference. It might reduce the amount of rubbish by a little bit, but not by much. This is because people don't really change their habits that much just because they have to pay a few cents for each bag.
Maybe we should think about other things that affect how much rubbish we produce, like how much money we have and how much time we have to recycle. Charging people for rubbish bags might not be the best way to solve the problem of rubbish.'"

Work and life. Many people are not happy with their jobs. They feel unvalued and overworked. Even those who have achieved success often feel bitter behind their fame. Loving your job used to be enough, but now people want more. They want to know how their job affects them as a person, their mind, character, and relationships. 
We need to think about what makes work fulfilling. It's not just about creating wealth, but about having a good life, discovering new talents, and meeting new people. 
Many people are unhappy with their jobs. Doctors are stressed, accountants are worried about their profession's ethics, and architects are not using their imagination. Middle managers are losing their confidence. 
We need to rethink what work means. It's not just about being busy, but about being happy and fulfilled. We need to give people a chance to design their own jobs and work with people they like. We need to learn to communicate better, not just talk about our work, but have real conversations. 
For example, hotel workers are often underused. They are intelligent and lively, but they work long hours for low pay. Hotels could be more than just a place to sleep. They could be cultural centers where people from all over the world meet and learn from each other. 
Work is a relationship. It's not just about obeying rules, but about being independent and working with people you respect. We need to rethink what we mean by ""work"" and make it more meaningful."

'Broadcasting: How Technology Shapes Society'
The word ""broadcasting"" originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand. It's not just an agricultural metaphor, but also a symbol of modern optimism. It's about planned growth, spreading something to a wide audience. The metaphor assumes a central location with resources to spread and reproduce. The question is, why did a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically develop in a way that fit this metaphor?
Television, as a technology, is related to two-way communication like the telephone and telegraph. It's surprising that, from the start, it was designed as a centralised ""mass"" medium. This fits with the social and economic structures of modern societies. Attempts to organize it differently remained just that - attempts.
Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning. In the 1930s, some people in Britain experimented with two-way television as an alternative to the phone. Radio amateurs built their own TV transmitters and receivers, and many people in the country tried it out. However, big businesses and the government stepped in and set standards, making it difficult for these grassroots efforts to continue.
Television was also seen as a potential competitor to the film industry in the US. In many countries, people mostly watched TV in public settings, not at home. In Britain, for example, most people saw TV in public places. This was even more true in Germany.
The idea of grassroots, two-way TV was unlikely to succeed. Instead, TV systems based on collective public reception were developed in several countries. Manufacturers wanted to sell TV sets to the public, and the idea of centralised broadcasting to a dispersed audience fit well with modern society.
As people's living standards improved and they entered the consumer society, they could afford to buy TVs and enjoy entertainment and cultural experiences at home. This is happening globally now. There is a connection between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting.
Centralized broadcasting was a way for governments to reach citizens efficiently and produce a sense of national unity. The pervasiveness of these processes and interests made centralized broadcasting the natural choice for radio and TV.
What's missing from this story is the idea of broadcasting as a way to promote democracy and equal access to information. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the wars, the idea of broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources was important. TV is changing, and the term ""broadcasting"" might become outdated. In that case, this metaphor will be seen as a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a particular phase of social modernization."

""Clutter Sometimes it seems like having many things doesn't make us feel secure. It's normal to want to have a home that meets our needs, but sometimes we get carried away and buy too much. Advertising is designed to make us feel like we need things we don't really need. If you don't have something, you might feel like you're not good enough.
Try not to look at advertisements next time you're out and about. They are very persuasive and can affect our thoughts without us even realizing it. We see ads everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and even on the internet.
Caves are a fascinating part of our natural world. Scientists have studied them for years to learn more about their origins, water, and life inside. People have been interested in caves for a long time, especially in places where they have an impact on daily life. However, visiting many caves requires physical ability, so not many experts have been able to study them. There is a connection between professional cave research and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.
Weather forecasting started with people observing the weather using their senses. Since the 17th century, it has become a highly technical science.

'Music and Theatre
I used to think that opera is mainly theatre. But after working at an opera house, I learned that music comes first. That makes sense. However, I come from a world of theatre, where words are more important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the show starts, and the performer and audience speak the same language.
When attending a musical performance, some people may not understand music well, but they can still appreciate the skill of the performers. It's like watching an athletics match - we know athletes work hard, but we can't do what they do.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't always understand the skill of acting and aren't impressed by something that seems easy to do. They ask actors how they memorize their lines.
In contrast, music audiences come with different expectations. They may not understand the music, but they can still appreciate the skill of the musicians. I think music can learn from theatre about how to connect with the audience.
Music performances can be theatrical, with passion, humor, and intimacy. But the way music is presented, with strict dress codes and a focus on the conductor, can make the audience feel like they are not part of the performance. Some people even applaud between movements, which can disrupt the music.
There are efforts to make music more accessible and break down barriers. I remember a remarkable opera that combined music and community. It was a powerful experience that brought people together.
I wish music could be more like theatre, taking risks and being more radical. Sometimes, this can happen when performances are held in unusual locations, which can be uncomfortable but exciting. I want music and theatre to thrive and for more people to enjoy them.'

Sand can be useful, but I don't like it when it's on the beach. It gets in your face, in your food, and even swallows small things like keys and coins. When it's wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you get on a towel or a clean floor, it falls off. Sand can stay with you for a long time, even longer than some illnesses. I don't like sand.
People have always wanted a safe and secure place to live. This is why we have locks and keys. Some companies have tried using computers to control locks, but people prefer the feeling of turning a physical key. That's why a locksmith company made sure their new electronic lock had a metal key.
I was worried about visiting the new Tate Modern art gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some of it, like sculptures and big photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would like more things. The idea is to let art talk to you, not to try to understand it. The new gallery helps visitors understand the art by giving them information about each piece. The labels explain what the art is trying to say, which helped me understand it better.

Making Movies
When we turn a book into a movie, we have to make some changes. We need to cut out some parts and make it shorter. This can be frustrating, but it can also be interesting. I worked on a script and saw that I could take out a lot of dialogue and descriptions and still get the same message across. This doesn't mean the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It's just that the way we tell a story is different in a book and a movie.
Movies can be very engaging. We can get caught up in the story and feel like we're part of it. But when the movie ends, we go back to reality. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent watching the movie. Some people don't think movies are an art form. They just see them as entertainment.
The film studio where I worked was a confusing place. There were many small rooms with identical furniture, and it was hard to find your way around. The studio didn't encourage visitors, so most people who worked there knew where to go. But for those who didn't, it was very confusing.
Many people want to make a movie. There are many books and courses on how to do it. Some people even make movies on their own with a small camera. One director, Robert Rodriguez, made a movie called El Mariachi for just $7,000. He became famous and was able to make more movies.
In the past, movie directors took time to learn their craft. They started by working behind the scenes and then made their own movies. Today, with the rise of independent filmmaking, aspiring directors have to be more self-sufficient and take risks.
I made some minor changes to the text to make it more accessible to a level B1 reader, including:

I grew up in a place called West Earlham, where the houses were close together and not very nice. There was a factory nearby that made chemicals, and sometimes the smell was bad. I don't remember much from my childhood, but I do remember looking out of my window and seeing the houses getting smaller and smaller. My mother was a strict person who always ironed and cleaned. She was also very particular about how people behaved. She didn't like it when I played in other people's gardens or when I didn't sit still for a long time. She had some friends, but they were not very friendly. They would talk about boring things like the weather and their aches and pains.
As a child, I went to school when I was five years old. My mother would take me to school on a bike with a special seat for children. Sometimes I would walk with other children in the street. I liked the summer holidays because I got to see the world outside of West Earlham. I would visit a man who lived next door and listen to his stories about the sea. I also went to a charity event once where I got lemonade and tried to learn about a charity for children.
My mother didn't like politicians and thought they were only interested in money. She didn't like the idea of charity and thought people were only doing it to get money. She took me to the museum on Sundays and we would walk around looking at paintings. She wasn't very interested in art, but she would make jokes sometimes. One time, she saw a painting of a Roman soldier and said, 'I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!'

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. It was getting dark and the air was humid and misty. I knew this street from when I was a child. There were many houses and shops, and I knew some of the people who lived there. As I walked, I noticed that the houses got smaller and the yards got smaller too. Over time, some of the houses had changed. The porches were no longer made of wood, but of metal. Some houses that used to be homes were now stores, and some stores were now homes.
I visited a friend who lived in a big, open space that used to be a warehouse. He wanted to make it feel more like a home, so he put up a wall made of plastic to divide the space. He also put in a kitchen and a living area. He wanted the kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or work with clients.
I also read about a famous writer named Bruce Chatwin. He loved to travel and write about his adventures. His first book was very successful and people loved it. However, he sometimes made up stories or changed the truth to make them more interesting.
I also thought about swimming. I like to swim in my pool and watch the rain fall on the water. One day, I had an idea to swim across Britain to reach the sea. I wanted to get away from the usual routine of swimming laps and explore new places.
Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But sometimes, we need to get off the beaten path and explore to discover what's really out there. Swimming, walking, and cycling can be a way to do that.

'Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no special reason. He was probably wrong. Later, scientists found that crying is important for people's relationships. A psychiatrist named John Bowlby showed that crying helps mothers and children bond. Some people think that children cry because they feel helpless. But why do adults still cry? It seems that the sound of crying is not as important as the way it looks. Crying might have helped early human groups feel safe and connected. We might cry to show sympathy for people who are suffering. We might also cry when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. Sometimes we cry when we watch a sad movie, but this is more likely to happen when we're with others. It's clear that crying is important for people's social connections, but scientists are still studying this.'

'Global Warming: How Hot Will It Get?
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some idea of what global warming is, but nobody is sure about its consequences. A warmer climate will bring changes to the weather all over the world. This will have big effects on plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support our population. Any changes to these resources are important.
The problem is that we don't know exactly how the world will change or what is causing these changes. We do know that human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air, which are related to temperature. These gases are building up and are already affecting the climate. However, our understanding of the Earth's heat balance is limited, so we're not sure about the current or future situations.
Scientists think that the Earth has warmed by about 6C over the past century. They believe that this is not a natural process and is partly caused by human pollution. Researchers have been studying how the climate will change if the temperature rises. They use special computer programs to predict the effects of global warming. These programs are not perfect and are slow and expensive to use.
Most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The computer programs suggest that the average global temperature will rise by 1-3.5C by 2100. Sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and there will be changes in rainfall patterns. Extreme weather events, like heatwaves and floods, will become more common in some areas.
Climate change will affect the natural environment and humans. It could change the places where plants and animals live, the mix of species, and the benefits they provide to humans. This will affect our resources, including food, water, and settlements. Some areas will be affected badly, while others might benefit. For example, some scientists have found that warmer temperatures have helped increase wheat production in Australia.
However, many of the predicted effects of global warming will be negative. Small changes in climate can affect the availability of water, leading to droughts and water shortages. This will be a problem in arid and semi-arid regions, as well as areas with high demand or pollution. The Mediterranean Basin is an example of this, with decreasing rainfall and changes in seasonality.
Climate change will also affect glaciers, which will impact on vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. The Arctic's ice cover might melt completely, making sea transport and oil and gas exploration easier, but also increasing the danger from icebergs. The most dramatic effect will be the rise in sea levels, caused by the expansion of the ocean and melting ice. This will lead to flooding and inundation, affecting many coastal cities, including London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people will lose their homes and livelihoods, and this could lead to millions of environmental refugees.'

'Art and its meaning can be difficult to understand because the things we consider works of art are often separate from our everyday experiences. We tend to think of art as something that exists independently, like a painting or a building. But art is actually about the way it affects us and the experiences it creates. When we separate art from our daily lives, it becomes hard to understand its true significance. This is because art is often associated with a special history and prestige, which can make it seem distant and unconnected to our everyday experiences.
To truly understand art, we need to connect it to the ordinary things that happen in our lives. We need to see how art is connected to the world around us, just like how geologists study the earth by looking at its different forms and conditions. We also need to forget about the art itself for a while and focus on the things that make it meaningful, like the way it makes us feel or the experiences it creates.
Many people enjoy things that are often not considered ""art"" in the classical sense, like movies, music, or comic strips. This is because they find enjoyment in the everyday experiences that art provides, rather than just admiring it as a separate entity. The key to understanding art is to connect it to our everyday lives and see how it affects us, rather than separating it from the world around us.'

The 1990s were a tough time for people who work in advertising. The economy was bad, and many companies were struggling. In Britain, for example, the economy was declining, interest rates were high, and many people lost their jobs. The advertising industry was also affected, with some companies having to cut their budgets. This made it difficult for advertising agencies to do their jobs, as they had to work with smaller budgets and produce more with less.
At the same time, companies were starting to realize the importance of marketing and advertising. They wanted to make sure they were producing products and services that customers wanted, rather than just what was convenient for them. This meant that advertising agencies had to be more creative and produce high-quality work.
However, many companies were not convinced that advertising was worth the cost. They wanted to see concrete evidence that it was effective, and they were not willing to spend a lot of money on it. This made it difficult for advertising agencies to do their jobs, as they had to convince clients that their work was worth the investment.
The situation was made even more challenging by the fact that many companies were looking for ways to cut costs and reduce their spending. This meant that advertising agencies had to find ways to produce high-quality work with smaller budgets.
In summary, the 1990s were a tough time for the advertising industry, with many challenges and uncertainties. However, it was also a time of change and growth, as companies began to realize the importance of marketing and advertising."

'Music in the Future
Music is an important part of our lives. Technology has changed the way we listen to music and how we make music. In the past, we had more opportunities to listen to music through the radio, TV, records, and CDs. However, this has led to a decline in live music performances and fewer jobs for professional musicians.
In the future, we can expect to have even more ways to listen to music and make music. New types of music will emerge, combining different styles. Technology will also help people to create and perform music, making it easier for more people to be involved.
But what about the future of music education? We need to make sure that people can learn to play different instruments and continue to play them throughout their lives. This means changing the way we teach music and how we assess progress. Musicians will need to be able to teach people of all ages, work with large groups, and have good communication and management skills.
It's important to raise the profile of music and make people realize how important it is. Those involved in music education need to work together to show that music education is of high quality.

Actors often get criticized for their work. Some people don't understand what actors do, and actors themselves can make it worse by talking about their craft too much. An actress named Pavlova once said, ""If I could explain it, I wouldn't dance it."" Actors should focus on their work rather than talking about it. 
A famous actor named Paul Scofield said, ""An actor's work has life and interest only in its execution. It withers away in discussion."" He means that an actor's work is most meaningful when they're performing, not when they're talking about it.
A review of a play called Hamlet says that the actor who played Hamlet, Adrian Lester, did a great job. He was able to switch between being a boy and a man, and his performance was simple and confident. He used his body and voice well to bring the character to life.
So, what is acting? Is it just imitating someone or is it something more? Who or what makes the actors' bodies come alive? This is the main question about the life of the theatre.
One director has a special way of rehearsing. He calls it ""dropping in."" The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, and then they think about what it means to them and wait for the impulse to speak. 
The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. The staff should feel like they're part of something special, too. The auditorium should be designed to make the audience feel close to the performers. It's important to have a sense of the past in the theatre, like old stone steps in a church. And, of course, you can't please everyone with every play. You have to take a risk and try something new.

Photography was invented by artists who wanted to create a lasting record of their surroundings. They used a special combination of light, a lens, and chemicals to create images that were more detailed and realistic than paintings. Some artists didn't like photography at first, but photographers knew they had created a new art form.
Book Illustration
In the past, it was common to include illustrations in children's books. This was true for novels too, but as time went on, fewer illustrations were included. The level of activity in children's publishing was still high, but it was mostly low-budget and sometimes led to routine and mediocre work. The black-and-white archive of children's book illustrations is like a treasure trove, full of wonderful and mediocre work. Some of the best illustrations are starting to be re-released and re-evaluated.'

""Some years ago, a website warned about the dangers of sharing our whereabouts online. The site said that when we post where we are, we're not just telling our friends, but also strangers who might not be nice to us. This made people realize that sharing too much on the internet can have bad consequences.
The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with others, and many people take advantage of this. They share photos, stories, and even secrets. But sometimes, they realize too late that the internet can be a dangerous place. It's like being in a crowded and treacherous sea, and we're not sure how to navigate it.
In the early days of the internet, a group of brave people called bloggers explored these dangers and learned how to navigate them. They shared their experiences, both good and bad, with others. These pioneers have already been where we are going, and we can learn from their stories.
One of these bloggers was Justin Hall, a student who started posting on the internet in 1994. He shared his life, including his thoughts, photos, and art. He even shared his relationships and personal struggles. But one day, he had to take down his blog because it was causing problems in his personal life.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, wrote about her job and her personal life. But one day, her boss found out about her blog and fired her. This is an example of what happens when we share too much online and forget that our digital life is connected to our real life.
Heather learned from her experience and started writing again, but this time with more caution. She became a successful blogger and even made a living from it. She realized that we can share our lives online, but we should be careful about what we share and how we share it.""

Many people are tired. This is a common problem in rich and busy countries. Research shows that 40 million Americans are tired all the time. Some books and movies feature characters who can't sleep. People need more sleep, but they often cut back on it when they're busy. They get up early to avoid traffic.
Scientists have studied sleep. They have a special laboratory at a university in England. They test people's sleep patterns. They ask them to sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. The results show that people need more sleep.
The laboratory also tests how sleep affects people's daily lives. For example, they test how sleep affects sailors, drivers, and people who work at night. They also test how noise from airplanes affects sleep.
One scientist, Dr. Reyner, has a special machine that simulates a motorway. She asks people to drive while she records their reactions. She finds that people can fall asleep while driving, even if they think they're not tired.
The scientists also know that humans sleep in a daily cycle. They switch between different stages of sleep. When they dream, their brain paralyses their body to prevent injuries.
There are many theories about why we sleep. Some scientists think that sleep repairs our bodies or helps us think better. But no one is really sure.
Some interesting facts about sleep are that women sleep for longer than men, and older people need less sleep. Scientists are still trying to understand why.
In the past, people used to sleep differently. They would sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. This was a time for reflection and relaxation. With the invention of artificial light, people started sleeping more solidly. Today, many people still struggle to get enough sleep.
In some parts of the world, people still don't sleep at night. They might wake up and go back to sleep later. This is because they need to watch out for animals, fires, and other dangers.
Overall, people all over the world need more sleep."

""Citizen Kane was a famous film made in 1941. It was not a big success when it first came out, but it became popular later because of television. This film has inspired many people to become film-makers. It was the first film made by Orson Welles, who was a talented director and actor. He worked with a great team, including a good cameraman, a good screenwriter, and a special effects expert. Welles had a great idea for the film, which was to make a movie about a newspaper owner who was like William Randolph Hearst. This was a perfect chance for Welles to show off his skills as a director and actor.
In the film, there is a character named Dermot who is talking to his wife, Carmel. They are discussing what he will do that day. Carmel is feeling a bit bored and is thinking about going for a walk to look at some shops. Dermot is okay with this and says she should enjoy herself.
Now, there is a survey that shows that job titles can cause problems at work.

I went to Vienna to take photos. I love taking pictures. They are my job and my passion. I find inspiration in the way light falls on a surface. One photo can capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I was in Vienna to take photos for a book about four cities in four seasons. London was already done, so I was in Vienna to take pictures of the city in winter. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had quit the job, so they asked me to take his place. I was free and willing to go. I stayed at the Europa hotel in the city centre. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy and hot trip. This time, I was on my own and wanted to take my time to enjoy the city and take some great photos. The first day, I just rode the trams around the city, getting on and off to see what it looked like. The weather was cold and grey, like the old baroque buildings. I didn't know what Schussner had done in the other seasons, and I didn't care. This was my Vienna, and I wanted to make it my own. I waited for the right moment to take my photos, and when it came, I was ready. The next morning, I went out early to take photos of Stephansplatz. The snow had fallen overnight, and it was still quiet and peaceful. The cathedral was massive and impressive, but I knew I couldn't capture it all in one shot. I would have to settle for something partial, but it could still be magical. There's something special about photography that I love. It's like magic, and it never gets old."

**Kinetic Art Exhibition at the Hayward Gallery**
The Hayward Gallery in London has been transformed into a fascinating exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is a type of art that involves movement. The exhibition shows how artists have explored movement in their work over the past 60 years. The curator, Guy Brett, has gathered a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films to showcase this type of art.
Visitors can enjoy the exhibition without needing to read a lot of text. They can simply look at the artworks and make their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney's Art**
David Hockney is a well-known artist. Some people like his work because it is easy to understand and it shows everyday things like leisure and relaxation. Others might like him because of his personality and the way he talks to the media. But does this mean his art is not important?
**A Different Kind of Exhibition**
The curator, Guy Brett, wanted to create an exhibition that was different from others. He gathered artworks from seven artists and put them in a warehouse. Each artwork was unique and didn't fit into a specific theme. This allowed visitors to see different styles and ideas together.
**Enjoying Art**
Some people enjoy looking at art without thinking too much about it. Others might think that knowing the background and meaning of a piece of art takes away from the pleasure of looking at it. However, knowing more about an artwork can actually make it more enjoyable. Our appreciation of art is influenced by the values of our society and can change over time.

'Metals
A long time ago, people might have found metals by accident. They might have been sitting by a river, waiting for fish to come close, when they saw a shiny yellow stone. It was different from other stones. Maybe this is how people first found gold. Because gold is soft, it was very useful. People wanted to use it a lot.
Copper might have been found by accident too. When people realized how useful copper tools were, they started to look for copper ore and ways to get the copper out of it. This helped people make new things and improve their lives.
St Ives
We walked down a narrow street in St Ives, trying to stay warm in the strong wind and avoiding the big waves on the beach. There were no people around and all the houses on the waterfront had their shutters closed. We had taken the train to St Ives and watched the weather get worse as we arrived. I had promised my friend that we would have nice walks and cozy evenings by the fire. Computer Modelling
It's hard to learn about the past because it's already happened. We can't ask the people who lived a long time ago what they did or why they made certain choices. Archaeologists can find clues, but we can't test our ideas by trying things out. We can't go back in time and watch what happened. But maybe we can. Computer modelling lets us create virtual worlds and people, with some of the same needs and abilities as real people. We can make rules for these virtual people and see how they behave. We can even change the weather or the number of people and see what happens.'

Vervet Monkeys
A group of vervet monkeys was being studied by Cheney and Seyfarth. One day, a strange male monkey appeared in a nearby tree. He was trying to join the group, but the dominant male didn't want him to. The dominant male had a clever idea to keep the stranger away. Whenever the stranger tried to come closer, the dominant male gave a special alarm call to warn the group that a leopard was nearby. The stranger would quickly go back to his own trees. This happened several times, but then the dominant male made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while he was walking across the open ground, too. This time, the stranger didn't go back to his trees.
Cats
In a village in England, people collected their cats' prey over a year. The cats caught over 1,000 items. A professor in America thought that if all the cats in Britain did the same, they would catch 100 million birds and small animals every year. However, most cats are not like the cats in this village. They live in towns and have smaller territories, so they catch fewer animals. The important question is whether the number of animals caught is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in the winter, and birds have a place to nest in trees and buildings. This means the bird population is higher than it would be naturally. The study shows that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
Buffalo's Day
Buffaloes are very important to the people who take care of them. They are like a lifeline. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping place and slowly make their way to the reeds and bulrushes. They are very tired and complain as they go. Once they are in the water, they relax and may stay there for a long time. They slowly move away from their home, but it's hard to notice. Eventually, they start swimming, but they are very low in the water and look like they're almost drowning. They spend the day grazing on plants in the reeds and bulrushes.
Picasso's Painting
Pablo Picasso painted a picture of a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some fish. The fish look like they're still alive. The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used many overlapping and interlocking shapes. The painting looks like an underwater world, but there is also a sense of danger and violence. The fish and crab seem to be fighting, and the chain around one of the fish looks menacing.

Photography has been used to record many aspects of human life for over a century and a half. It has allowed us to capture moments in time and space, and to see things that are far away or very small. Photography has shown us the world, including remote places, the solar system, and the complexities of modern life. It is a powerful way to express the human experience.
The idea of using pictures to record events is not new. People have been creating images for thousands of years. The earliest known images were made around 35,000 years ago. These images were likely used for many purposes, such as to record hunting trips, to help people understand the world, or to decorate homes.
Photography has been a popular way to record events since its invention in the 19th century. People thought it was a way to get a true and accurate picture of the world. They believed that a photograph was like a window into the past. However, this idea has changed over time. Now, we know that photographs can be influenced by the person taking them and the culture they come from.
Photography has been used to show people things that are important, such as the beauty of nature, the struggles of people, and the achievements of society. It has also been used to help people understand different cultures and to bring about change. For example, photography played a big role in the Italian Renaissance and has helped shape the media culture of our time.

**How to Write Poetry and Other Forms of Writing**
Writing is like walking through a minefield. You need to be careful and spontaneous. Don't try to teach others how to write, as everyone has their own way. Just read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination run free.
Some people need a calm and secure life to write poetry. Others can write when they are unhappy. Some write at a set time, while others wait for inspiration. Everyone is different, as long as they don't copy someone else's style.
**The Short Story**
A short story should not have too many characters or too much detail. It should be short and to the point. Use flashbacks only if necessary, and make sure they help the story move forward. Dialogue is a good way to reveal different opinions and keep the reader interested.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You don't always know what will happen next, but you make moves based on what you know. The more you play, the more you learn about the game. You start to see patterns and strategies.
**Looking at Writing**
Writing is not natural for humans, unlike speaking. Children learn to speak without lessons, but writing is different. Writing systems were invented by a few complex societies, and it's not easy for children to learn. We need to understand how writing works and how children's minds work to help them learn.

Here is the simplified version of the text for a learner of English at level B1:
I'm not sure if I should write this book. It's not a traditional novel with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it's a collection of memories about a man I knew, but I didn't know much about what happened to him in between. I could have made things up to fill in the gaps, but I don't want to. I just want to write what I know.
To protect the people in the story, I've given them fake names. I've also tried to make sure that no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and maybe he never will be. But maybe his way of living and his special qualities will have a lasting impact on the people around him.
I'm not pretending that the conversations in the book are word for word accurate. I didn't take notes, but I have a good memory for important things. I've written the conversations in my own words, but they're based on what was really said.
I've also taken some liberties with what the characters said, just like historians do. I want to make the story interesting and believable. The reader can see where I've done this and can choose to ignore it.
I'm a bit worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone who is from a different place. We're not just who we are; we're also where we grew up, what we ate, what we read, and so on. You can't learn all that just by hearing about it; you have to experience it yourself. I've only written about people from my own country before, and even then, I've only given them a brief introduction. In this book, I'm trying to show the reader what I saw, not what the characters saw themselves."

'POETRY RECITALS
Nowadays, people who are living through this time may find the world of poetry confusing. However, it's only in the future that we can see the importance and order of great poets clearly. Right now, there are many different kinds of poetry being written, and different ways of presenting, criticizing, and teaching it. Some poets write poems for readers, while others perform them in front of an audience.
There is a big debate between these two groups. Some poets who write for readers think that poets who perform in front of an audience are not as good. They think that these poets are only doing it for the applause and not for the art. On the other hand, the performing poets think that the readers are not interested in poetry and that they only read it because it's a duty.
Despite this, poetry readings have become more popular over the past 20 years. Small groups in towns and cities organize readings in community centers or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to their students. Arts festivals also feature poetry readings.
The consequences of these events are not clear. For some poets, performing in front of an audience is a good way to get their work known. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand. However, for poets who are dedicated to their craft, performing in front of an audience can be a problem. They may be tempted to write simpler poems just to please the audience.
It's important to remember that attending a poetry reading is not the same as reading poetry on the page. While it can be enjoyable, it's not a substitute for reading the poems themselves. To get the most out of a poetry reading, it's best to have the text in front of you or have read the poems before. The main reason for poetry readings is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for a special group of people.'

**Oral History**
When historians collect information from people who lived in the past, they need to be careful. The person telling the story may not remember everything correctly. The historian also has a big influence on what the person says. The historian chooses who to talk to and what questions to ask. Even if the historian doesn't ask questions, just being there can change the way the person thinks about the past. The historian's own thoughts and ideas can also affect what the person says.
Even the person telling the story may not always remember things correctly. Their memories can be mixed up with things they learned from others, like TV or books. They may also remember things because they feel a certain way about them, like nostalgia or sadness.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: by looking at their bodies (physiology) and by studying their behavior in the wild (whole animal). Physiologists focus on how animals' bodies work, like how their nerves and muscles work together. Those who study animals in the wild look at how they behave and what affects their behavior.
Some people who study animals focus on how they learn, like in labs with rats and pigeons. Others study how animals behave naturally, like in their natural habitats. These two groups used to be separate, but now they are working together.
**Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you need to learn two things at the same time: the subject itself and how to study it. You need to understand the content of the subject and the methods used to learn it. The two are closely connected.
You may think you already know a lot about social sciences because you experience social life every day. But each social science has its own special focus, methods, and ideas. These ideas help us go beyond what we already know and understand.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was an art that included order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that architecture was important for aesthetics, not just function.
The origins of classical architecture are complex. There were simple huts in ancient Greece and Italy that didn't meet the artistic standards of the time. But these huts still had a basic form that influenced later architectural ideas. The classical temple is actually a simple hut with a single room.

He joked that no one would want their old van, but the sisters didn't like this comment. Chen then took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He wanted to plan his future and thought he would have an education in business and own many restaurants. As they looked at the sea, they saw a ship in the distance. Chen was excited and showed it to Man Kee through a telescope. He told him that it was a special ship that would take them back home when they were finished here. The ship was old and small, but Chen knew that it was special. The family then lost sight of the ship as it sailed over the horizon.

""Online Book Reviews: More than Just Fun? 
When the Internet first became popular, people thought it would be a great way for anyone to share their opinions. And that's exactly what happened with book reviews. Amazon, a big online bookstore, allowed anyone to write a review of a book. This was a big change from the past, when only experts got to write reviews.
At first, it was a bit chaotic. Anyone could write a review, and there was no one to check if it was good or not. Some people wrote silly reviews, like saying a book was great just because they liked the author. Others wrote mean reviews, attacking the author personally.
But despite the chaos, most people took writing reviews seriously. They wanted to help others decide if a book was worth buying. And surprisingly, the reviews were very accurate. Most people wrote honest opinions, and readers could trust them.

Art has changed a lot over the past 200 years. We used to think that artists had to be different from others and create something new and surprising. But now, we often feel uncomfortable with art that is too new or different. We expect artists to be special and talented, and we don't like it when they try to do something different.
I want to tell you a story about an artist. He chooses a text from an art book that talks about different types of pictures. Then, he asks someone to write the text on a canvas in simple black letters. The question is: is this a painting?
Some artists have a hard time changing their style and trying new things. They are expected to keep doing the same type of art that people like. But some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have been able to break the rules and still be successful.
Now, let's talk about a new exhibition at the Mercury Gallery in London. The artist, Eric Rimmington, has created a new show that is different from his usual style. He has painted the London Underground, which he finds very interesting. The exhibition has 40 paintings and drawings that show the magic of the underground world.
Finally, I want to share a passage from a novel. The main character has escaped to a remote island to heal himself. He is alone, but he is not happy or unhappy. He is just suspended in his memories. He talks about the importance of art and how it can help us make sense of the world and find meaning in our lives.

She thought it was important to live in a nice area, especially since she was ambitious and wanted to be successful.
Simon and Lois decided that one of them would have to take the bus to work. Simon's job was on the other side of London, so he had to take the bus. He was not happy about it and spent his commute time thinking about his unhappiness.
Simon's grandfather used to live in a nice house in Hampstead, where Simon stayed as a boy. His grandmother was a kind and caring person who made sure Simon's father, a lawyer, was comfortable after a long day at work. Simon's grandmother was proud of her husband's work and was involved in good causes. Simon's wife Lois is also a lawyer and wants to be successful. She thinks her career is important and so does Simon.
Simon and Lois's whole lifestyle depends on their two salaries. But now, they might lose everything because of a woman named Venetia, who is angry with Simon. Venetia is a lawyer and defended a man named Brian Cartwright, who accused Simon of doing something wrong four years ago. Simon denies the accusations and feels guilty and ashamed. He wishes he had handled the situation differently.

I moved to this place because I thought I could be anonymous. I wanted to live among people who didn't care about their homes or gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon started to recognize me. Next door's overgrown roses remind me that the garden was once loved. I usually stay inside, but tonight I'm outside, watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I've been clearing the garden, and my arms are covered in scratches.
My neighbour, Jaz, comes out of her window. She's an author, and I sometimes help her with her writing. 'I've been clearing the garden,' I say. 'How's your writing going?' 'It's terrible,' she replies. 'I have to answer so many questions about my work every day.' She invites me to come up and get a drink from her fridge.
I don't want Jaz in my garden, so I go inside and she follows me. She's lying on my chair, and I sit down on the cushion. 'You're on holiday, aren't you?' she asks. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow,' I say. 'I need to ask you to feed my cat.' 'Of course, I will,' she says. 'If I'm around.' I know she will be.
Jaz asks me about her book, 'The Cruelty of Red Vans'. I like the title, so I tell her. She shows me her manuscript, and I give her some advice. 'Write about nice people,' I say. 'People who are kind and good.' She's upset, and we argue. She thinks I'm being too critical.
Later, I'm sitting in my calm kitchen when I remember my old school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine. She would wink at us and say, 'I've had my moments.'"

**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it helps us feel connected to the past. We usually learn about our family's past and the stories of our grandparents. But it's not just about our personal heritage. Understanding our past helps us understand our future. It's like inheriting a culture that has been passed down through generations.
Heritage is also important for our well-being. It affects many aspects of our lives, from customs to material things. Traditionally, we learned about our past through stories and legends from our ancestors. But in modern times, we have to rely on places and buildings to learn about our history.
**The Fens**
I wrote a book about a place called the Fens in England. Some people might think it's a strange choice, as I don't have a personal connection to the area. But I chose it because of its unique landscape. The Fens are a flat and empty area, but once you get to know it, it's actually very special. It's a place that feels both familiar and strange at the same time.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections accessible to everyone. This means more than just putting things on display. Museums should use creative ways to engage visitors and make them feel connected to the past. They should also make their collections available to a wide range of people, including those who may not be able to visit the museum in person.
**Architecture and Environment**
Preserving our environment and towns is important. Change is a natural part of life, but it can be scary. We need to learn how to handle change and make sure it doesn't destroy our sense of community and history.

'Einstein is a famous scientist. Many people know his face, but not much about what he did. He is known for his theory of relativity, which is hard to understand. Einstein changed the way people think about the universe. He looked at the basics of time, space, matter, and energy. Before Einstein, scientists thought that time and space were fixed. Einstein said they are not fixed, but relative.
As children, Lydia and I didn't like reading prize-winning books because we thought they would be boring. Our father would give us money to read certain books, and sometimes he would give us a book with a note that said ""This book is not literature"". He wanted us to read different types of books, including fiction and poetry.
The origin of language is still a mystery. Many people have different ideas about how language developed. Some think that primitive people made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. These sounds may have been the start of language. Language probably developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. At first, language was used for friendly conversations and to help people in power. It was not used to share information, as some people thought.'

Writing Reviews
Frank Kermode talks about the job of writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and are only published for a short time. They are often limited to a certain length and are usually only read for a day or a week. Some people think that reviewing is not a serious job because it's not as important as writing a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled job that requires a lot of knowledge and good writing skills.
A reviewer needs to think about who their audience is and write in a way that is easy to understand. They also need to know a lot about different subjects and be able to write in a way that is enjoyable to read. Many reviewers also write other things besides reviews, such as novels or articles.
Some reviewers, like the American novelist John Updike, enjoy collecting their reviews and publishing them in books. They like to have a record of their work and feel proud of what they have written. Even though reviewing is often seen as a secondary job, many people enjoy doing it and find it a way to express their opinions and share their knowledge with others.
In some countries, academics (people who work at universities) are allowed to write reviews in addition to their main job. This is because it helps them stay connected to the outside world and reminds them to write in a way that is easy to understand. Reviewing is an important job that requires a lot of skill and knowledge, and it's something that many people enjoy doing."

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at level B1:
Ralph walked into his flat, feeling a mix of emotions. It was a feeling he still got sometimes, even after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would rush home from work, excited to see what had happened while he was away. The flat was his own space, where he could relax and be himself. He didn't worry about burglars or broken pipes, just about whether it was tidy or messy. Over time, the flat became a part of him, like an extension of his own home. He didn't like it when it didn't stay the same, and he often felt lost and alone.
When he got home from work, he would often look forward to his free time. He would sit alone, listening to music or reading, and try to relax. But sometimes he felt empty and unsure of himself. He would wonder why he was doing certain things and what he wanted from life. He had always wanted to do something important, but he never really knew what that was. After university, he looked for a job, but he didn't really have any ambition. He just wanted to survive.
One day, he got a job at a local newspaper, and he was relieved to have it. He didn't think about what the job would be like or whether he would like it. He just wanted to have a job. His boss, Neil, told him he was the only graduate who applied, and Ralph took that as a compliment.

'Goat Racing
I went to a goat racing event on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. It was very crowded, with many people, food stalls, and music. I had to push my way through the crowd to get a good spot. The area where the goats would run was marked off, and some people were trying to keep the goats in line. It was a challenge, as goats are known to eat almost anything.
Canoe Trip
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night ahead. Our canoe was wet and we didn't know where to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or houses since morning. In the dark, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torches were almost dead, so we changed the batteries, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A couple of miles later, Lesley spotted a light in the distance. We thought it might be a village, but it was just the moon shining on the water. We heard the sound of rushing water, but we couldn't see what was happening. We kept moving.
How to be Presentation Perfect
As a manager, I often have to give presentations to my colleagues and shareholders. I'm not very good at it, but I need to improve. If you're like me, you're not alone.

Do your homework and prepare for the questions your audience might ask. Start with something everyone can agree on and build up to your conclusion.'

Some things cannot be rushed. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry, but if you're impatient and add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it will curdle. The same is true for the mind. It works at different speeds. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can speed up some processes, like solving puzzles or doing math in our heads, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they will break down.
The mind has different ways of working. Some are fast and automatic, while others are slower and more thoughtful. We need all of these ways to function well. For example, when we're in danger, our brain and body work together quickly to help us react. This is our ""wits"" at work. Then there's thinking, which involves figuring things out and solving problems. This is our ""intellect"". Finally, there's a slower, more relaxed way of thinking, which is often called ""contemplation"" or ""meditation"". This way of thinking is just as important as the others.
Some problems are better solved with a slow and thoughtful approach. We need to give our minds time to think slowly and deeply to understand complex issues. This is especially true when we're dealing with unclear or subtle problems. In fact, research has shown that our slower, less deliberate ways of thinking are better suited to solving these kinds of problems.
Creativity and wisdom often come from this slower way of thinking. Poets and philosophers have known this for a long time, and scientists are now starting to study it too. They're finding that our unconscious mind can do many things that our conscious mind cannot, like recognizing patterns and solving complex problems."

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. Until 30 years ago, there were not many charts and books about astronomy. Now, there are many telescopes and equipment available. Computers and calculators have made it easier to make charts and analyze data. This might seem like a great time for amateur astronomers. However, many things have changed that make it harder to enjoy astronomy. The skies are now filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and make it hard to see the stars. Also, there are too many choices in life, and this can be overwhelming.

Scientists' Motivation

Some scientists are asking themselves why they want to know everything and why they can't just be content with what they know.

Dr. Johnson said that writing is hard work. If you don't put effort into your writing, it's not enjoyable to read.

Now, with computers, it's easy to write quickly, but this can lead to mistakes.

'People have always had strong feelings about birds. Some love them, some fear them, and some even worship them. But what does this say about us? A small brown bird, a wren, is bouncing against the glass of a greenhouse. It's an important bird in British culture. In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could predict their luck. Today, many British homes still have pictures or ceramics of wrens. The wren is a special bird because it has a place in our imagination and our hearts. A forest without wrens is a sad and empty place.
People have a special connection with many birds because they have lived close to nature for a long time. This connection is important for our understanding of the world and the creatures in it. Our feelings about birds can change over time, just like our culture changes. For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed it bread. But soon it was seen as a pest and was almost wiped out. Now, it's a symbol of conservation efforts in Britain.
Our relationship with birds is more than just cultural. It's connected to our human nature. We are fascinated by birds because they can fly, sing, and are free. Our feelings about birds are a reflection of our own identity and our connection to nature. Some people might think these feelings are old-fashioned and unnecessary, but they are still an important part of who we are. That's why birds have become important indicators of environmental change. Conservationists are worried about the decline of many bird species, not just because it's a loss for nature, but also because it's a loss for our culture.
The stories and legends about birds are important because they connect us to our past and to the natural world. These stories have power to evoke feelings and attitudes that are still alive today. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our own backyards, our connection to them is deeper than just scientific facts. Birds are fascinating and mysterious, and the stories we tell about them help us understand what they are trying to tell us.'

'Maps help us understand how places are related to each other on the Earth's surface. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in hours or days, but this didn't give a clear idea of the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for people who just wanted to know where to go and how far it was, it wasn't crucial. That's why written guides were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, don't always show accurate directions. Important landmarks along a route were first marked with signs, and their size showed how important they were. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and the place they were from. To understand old maps, you need to know the rules they used.
Over time, cartography has become more accurate and comprehensive. Scientists have helped us make better maps by developing new tools and techniques. For example, we used to determine direction by looking at shadows or constellations, but now we use compasses and instruments to measure angles. The study of the Earth and exploration have also helped us make better maps. Astronomers discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, which changed the way we map large areas.
As the use of maps grew, so did the people who needed them. Travelers, merchants, soldiers, and scientists all needed maps for different reasons. To meet these needs, cartographers had to develop new ways of mapping different things, like geological features, climates, and land use. Today, cartographers use many different methods to create maps that help us understand many different things.
It's important to remember that maps are not always accurate or up-to-date. They can be old or outdated, and we need to be careful when using them. Despite this, maps are a valuable record of human history and can help us learn about the past.'

Language is a special ability that humans have. We can use it to communicate with each other in a precise way. Language is so important that it's hard to imagine life without it. When we're with others, we usually talk to each other. Even when we're alone, we might talk to ourselves, our pets, or even plants. I like to think of language as an instinct, like a spider spinning a web. It's something we naturally know how to do.
The weather and climate have a big impact on the lives of animals and plants. The climate can shape the landscape and affect what kind of plants and animals can live there. For example, warm and wet weather can create a jungle with many different species, while cold and windy weather can only support a few types of living things. The weather is caused by big movements of air in the atmosphere. The Earth's rotation and the sun's heat also contribute to these movements.

A recent example of what goes wrong is Robert Hughes's series on American art, American Visions.

Metals Trading
I used to work as an international metals dealer for 20 years. I became known for being a good speculator. Metals are not as regulated as other markets, so with a bit of luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. The industry is all about taking risks. The free-market economy fits well with this culture. However, the free-trade economists who claimed that the market would maintain the price of scarce metals were wrong. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. After inflation, the prices of most metals are now half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate allegations against one of the companies that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

When editors look for new self-help books, they think about how easy it is to sell the book, not how well-written it is. They want to know if the author is famous, and if the book has a catchy title. Autobiographies are books about a person's life. Sometimes writers write things that are not true to make their stories more interesting. They might do this to make people like them more or to sell more books.
Dashiell Hammett wrote detective stories. His stories are like allegories, which are stories that have a hidden meaning. The detective stories show how people can solve problems and work together. The main character, the private eye, is like a detective who works alone. He is between the law and the criminals, and he understands both sides.

'Air-conditioning at the gym
Cannons Gym in the City of London has turned up the air-conditioning to deal with the hot summer weather. It's so cold that it feels like being in the Arctic! This is an example of how we often use air-conditioning too much. We could use other ways to keep cool, like using natural light and ventilation.
Sundials
It's interesting that people are starting to use sundials again. These are old instruments that show time by the sun's position. A long time ago, they were very important for keeping accurate time. Now, people are using them again because they remind us of our place in the world.

Keith and Dawne booked a package holiday to Venice, Italy. They went to the travel agency to book, and the clerk told them that the other people on the trip were a group of school students learning Italian. However, something went wrong. When they arrived at the airport, they handed over their tickets to a woman in a yellow-and-red uniform, and she checked their details. An hour later, they boarded a plane and met a woman who announced that they would be taken to their destination by coach. They arrived at a hotel in Switzerland, but it was not the one they booked. They were given a room for 12 nights, and the receptionist explained that they would have the lake and the water birds nearby.
Keith and Dawne were surprised and a bit worried. They realized that they had been booked into a different group. They explained to the receptionist that they were meant to be in Venice, but he didn't know what they were talking about. They described the travel agency and the counter clerk, but the receptionist didn't know anything about it. A woman, Mrs. Franks, came and introduced herself. She explained that Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends people to different places at different prices. She said that all the tickets and labels look similar, and it's easy to get confused.
Keith and Dawne were still not convinced. They tried to remember every detail of their journey: handing over the tickets, waiting, getting on the plane, and meeting the pilot and air hostess. They met an elderly couple on the plane who were also on the trip. The couple had slept well and enjoyed the lake view.
Keith and Dawne didn't say anything to each other about the irony of the situation. They had booked a holiday to escape the needs and demands of the elderly, but instead, they ended up in a package tour with older people.

Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer, is now an inspiration for American business leaders. Most people in Britain know who he is and what he did. However, in America, he was not well-known until recently. Now, many Americans are interested in his story and are making films, books, and exhibitions about him.
Some business leaders in America see Shackleton as a model of good management. They like how he led his team and communicated with them during difficult times. Shackleton was a brave and resourceful leader who put the safety of his team first. He made tough decisions, like turning back from reaching the South Pole when it was almost within reach.
Shackleton's story is inspiring because he showed that even in difficult situations, a leader can stay calm, think clearly, and make good decisions. He believed in optimism, physical endurance, and patience. He also believed in being adaptable and willing to change plans if something wasn't working.
American business leaders like Shackleton's approach because it is relevant to their work. They face challenges like crises, mergers, and acquisitions, and they need to communicate effectively with their teams and clients. Shackleton's story shows that a good leader can make a difference in difficult times.

""In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a special primate called the aye-aye. It is similar to a woodpecker because both animals search for food in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to drill into the wood and its long tongue to eat the insects inside. The aye-aye uses its front teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin finger to find the insects.
Scientists have studied how the aye-aye finds the insects. They put logs with holes in front of the aye-ayes and some holes had mealworms inside. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, not looking at the surface for clues. The scientists thought maybe the aye-ayes were using their sense of smell or hearing, but they were wrong. The aye-ayes could find the mealworms even when they couldn't smell or hear them.
The scientists discovered that the aye-ayes can sense the empty holes as well as the ones with food. They tap the wood with their middle finger and use their big ears to listen for the sound of the tapping. This is like how bats use sound to find their way in the dark. The aye-aye might also hear the insects moving when they tap the wood.
The aye-aye is like a combination of a woodpecker and a bat. It also behaves like a squirrel, with teeth that grow continuously and a long finger to open nuts.""

'Flying in Space: An Unforgettable Experience
Journalist Tom Mumford joined 13 students on a special flight to test their scientific theories. The plane, a Boeing KC-135, looked normal from the outside. But inside, it was different. There were no windows, and the seats were gone, except for a few at the back. The students were excited to be on this unique flight. They had competed with other students to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions.
The flight was like a rollercoaster ride. The plane went up and down, and sometimes it was weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than the Earth. They did 29 turns, or curves, and spent 10 minutes in weightlessness. During this time, they did experiments. Some students studied how cats land on their feet, while others looked at how metal joins change in space. Another group tried to make special sails that use sunlight to move.
After the flight, the students felt exhilarated. It was an amazing experience that they would never forget. One student said, ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want to even more.""'

I had an unusual experience when I didn't have any summers for a while. Every year, I would go to New Zealand, which is in the winter, and I would have nine winters in a row. My parents suggested buying a small piece of land in New Zealand, where my brother, sister, and I could take care of it. They said, 'If you take the time to plant trees, you can have it.' The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, as my father grew up there. They found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland. It's not the best land, but it's good for planting trees. I love working with land. I had worked on sheep stations in Australia before, and planting trees seemed like a great idea. I was very excited and enthusiastic about it. My family became excited too as we started planting. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, my brother, sister, and I had planted the whole 70 acres.
It was a challenging time. It rained a lot, and it was cold. But it was also a happy time. Every morning, we would get ready for the next planting session. We would get out of the car, and it would be raining. We would put on our wet clothes from the day before and start planting. It was hard work, but it was also very satisfying. I had a friend who was an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful because I had never planted trees before. We would fill our bags with trees and then plant them along a line. It was hard to get the lines straight, but once we did, it was easy. I enjoyed the physical work and got very fit.
After a while, I could plant trees automatically. I would get into a rhythm and use the minimum number of strokes to dig the hole. It was mentally interesting too. I would think about the natural world and our place in it. Many of my ideas about the environment and our connection to nature started to come to me during this time.
I have been back to New Zealand four times since then and seen the trees grow. It's been very satisfying to see how well they did. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but it worked out well in the end. The trees are now 20 years old and healthy.
I took a break from teaching and went back to the tree farm in 1984. I wrote my first book there. I lived in a small cabin and would write in the mornings, prune trees in the afternoons, and do research in the evenings. I still feel a strong connection to that place and the link between people and the earth."

**Bringing Up Badgers**
My husband Derek and I have a farm in Somerset where we care for orphaned animals. One day, our helpers brought us three small badger cubs. They were only about eight inches long and had grey fur. Their eyes were a milky colour, and they looked up at me with tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before.
The cubs were cold and hungry, but we were able to feed them and keep them warm. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow. At first, we fed them with a syringe, but later they started drinking from a bottle. They were very playful and enjoyed each other's company.
After a few weeks, Willow started to feel unwell. He died from a lung infection. We were sad, but we continued to care for the other two cubs. A few days later, a local farmer brought us another male badger cub, Willow II. He was a bit smaller than the others and had trouble eating. We had to feed him differently and be patient with him.
As the cubs grew, we introduced them to different foods, like cereals and fruit. They started to go on walks at night, and we would join them. They would play and chase each other, and sometimes they would nip at us. We had to be careful not to get too close.
As the summer went on, the cubs grew bigger and stronger. They started to venture out of their enclosure and explore the surrounding area. We noticed that other badgers were visiting our field, so we built a special home for them, with tunnels and chambers. The cubs loved their new home and spent most of their time playing and exploring.
Now, the cubs are almost fully grown, and they don't need us as much. We still see them occasionally, and they come to say hello before they go off into the night. They have their own territory now, and we're proud of the home we built for them."

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer who lived a long time ago. Halley is best known for the comet that bears his name. But he also did important work on something called the ""variations of the compass"". This is the difference between the direction the compass points to and the true north. Without this information, sailors couldn't navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley went on two sea voyages to measure the variations of the compass. The first trip was cut short due to problems with the crew, but he went again and traveled to many places, including Rio de Janeiro and Newfoundland. He wrote a book about his findings, which was very useful for sailors for over a century.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 to make it happen. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition to cross Antarctica, is helping him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley when he worked at a research station in Antarctica. He thinks Halley was a remarkable person who did many important things, not just astronomy. Halley developed a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book.
Dr. Clark's trip will be a scientific expedition. He will use special instruments to measure the magnetic field of the Earth, which is slowly changing. This will help scientists refine their models of the Earth's magnetic field. He will also use a satellite to help him navigate and take readings.
Dr. Clark has the experience and skills to make this trip a success. He has already sailed a long distance and has worked at the British Geological Survey. He is willing to spend eight months at sea to make this trip happen."

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a puzzle that has been discussed for a long time. How did these birds evolve to have such a big, fancy tail? The zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are trying to find the answer.
Charles Darwin thought that living creatures changed over time through a process called evolution. He believed that the creatures that were best suited to their environment were more likely to survive and have babies. But Darwin had trouble explaining why peacocks had such big tails. He thought that the females liked the males with the most beautiful tails, just for the sake of being beautiful. However, his friend Alfred Russel Wallace thought that the hens must be choosing the males with the best tails because they have some other quality that is not obvious to humans.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to figure out why peacocks have such big tails. They are studying the behavior of the peacocks at Whipsnade, where they live in a semi-wild environment. The researchers have found that the hens do prefer the males with the most beautiful tails. The males with the most eye-spots on their tails are the most attractive to the hens. However, it's not clear whether the males with the best tails are also healthier or more successful in other ways.
The researchers are trying to find out if the males with the best tails are also better in other ways. They are comparing the babies of the males that the hens find attractive with the babies of the males that the hens find unattractive. If the babies of the attractive males are healthier and grow faster, it would suggest that the hens are making a practical choice. There is also a theory that the males with the best tails are less likely to have parasites, and that this is what makes them more attractive to the hens. The researchers are still studying this to see if it's true.
Finally, there is a mathematical theory that suggests that the peacocks' tails evolved because of a feedback loop. If a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit their father's tail and their daughters will inherit their mother's preference for long tails. Over time, this could lead to the evolution of the peacocks' tails. This theory would also support Darwin's idea that the females are choosing ""beauty for beauty's sake""."

'MY BOAT, MY DREAM The best boat should combine old and new ideas, says Tom Cunliffe. He built his own boat, 'The Westerman', with this idea in mind. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London has many beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats are the result of a design revolution 25 years ago. My boat, however, is different. It's been designed recently, but it looks like it's 100 years old. Some people might think I'm a romantic, but I'm not sure about that. This boat has the best of both worlds - old-fashioned design and modern technology. It's true that modern technology can make sailing easier, but it can also make us forget the challenges of life at sea. I think sailors should still experience the difficulties of sailing, like struggling with the sails. Why sail if everything is too easy? I want my boat to be a boat, not a house on the water. I used to have another boat, Hirta, which I sailed around Britain for a TV show. She was very comfortable, but not luxurious. She taught me that simplicity is the best. When I got hurt, I had to sell her. I searched for a new boat, but none were suitable. So, I built my own from scratch. The Westerman has been perfect for me. The designer, Nigel Irens, drew the boat on a napkin and then used a computer to make it more accurate. He even made a model of the boat before building it. The boat has sailed across the North Atlantic and has won several racing competitions. It looks timeless, sails smoothly, and has a peaceful atmosphere. I think this is because it was designed just as a sailing boat, without any fancy furniture. This is the way boats have been built for a long time. My boat is made of treated wood and is waterproof. It's like a glass fibre boat, but looks and feels like a traditional boat.'

**Natural Talents**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. In fact, we share almost 98% of the same genes. This means that the things that make us different from animals are recent developments. Our physical abilities, such as making art, must have come from a small number of genes. This is a big responsibility for a few genes.
Studies of animal behavior have shown that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Even monkeys have a simple language.
The only things that really set us apart from animals are art and language. But if art is unique to humans, it's strange that our ancestors didn't create art for millions of years. The earliest known human art is from around 35,000 years ago, in the form of cave paintings and statues.
Some people think that human art is different because it's non-utilitarian, made for pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive. But these claims are not entirely true. While some animal behaviors are functional, human art is not. And while animals may not make art for pleasure, they may still enjoy it. For example, birds sing during the breeding season, which suggests they may enjoy their songs.
The fact that human art is learned, rather than instinctive, is also not unique. Some birds learn their songs from their parents, and humans learn their art from others. In fact, human art styles change quickly, whereas animal behaviors remain the same.
There is a famous example of chimpanzees creating art. Two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, were taught to paint and created many beautiful works of art. Some of these paintings were even sold at an art show in London. This shows that the distinction between human and animal art is not as clear-cut as we thought.

Everyone loves technology because it makes our lives easier and gives us more time for other things. But I think technology is taking over our lives. I had a problem with my word processor, which cost me a lot of money to fix. This made me wonder if we really need all these gadgets. 
I started to get rid of some of my household technology as it broke or got old. This made me think about what technology gives us. Is it just more time to buy more gadgets? I don't think so. I'm glad I don't have to use a noisy washing machine or a sewing machine that makes a lot of noise. I can take my time and enjoy the simple things in life. 
I used to think that sewing by hand was boring, but now I enjoy it. I can listen to the radio or talk to my family while I sew. It's nice to sit by the fire with a cup of tea and sew. I'm not in a rush to finish anything, and I feel more in control of my life. I'm even doing the washing up by hand, and it's a nice break from the rest of my day. 
Now I'm looking around my house and wondering if we really need all these gadgets. Maybe we can save money by not using them. We could even do without electric lights!

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a level B1 learner:
Meet Charles Hurst, a skilled cabinet-maker. He has been making beautiful furniture for 10 years. His workshop is under a railway arch in East London. When I visit him, he seems busy and a bit gruff. But his workshop is full of half-finished furniture and wood in many different colours. He has a good reputation and his order book is always full for several months.
Charles is proud of his work and is not happy with cheap, mass-produced furniture. He thinks many craftsmen today are not as good as they used to be. He is self-taught and has learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his clients are private individuals, and he likes working with them because they appreciate his work.
Charles is confident in his abilities, but he also knows that there are others who are better than him. He admires other craftsmen and is not afraid to say so. He is critical of those who try to make art out of furniture and think it's about making a statement. He believes a piece of furniture should be something people can use.
When I leave, Charles says, ""I'm just making furniture."" He's down-to-earth and humble, despite being very good at what he does.

'People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This is a big part of our lives, so it's clear that sleep is important. But what exactly is its purpose? Scientists don't agree on the answer. There are three main ideas about why we sleep. One idea is that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. While we sleep, our bodies fix any damage from the day and get ready for the next day. Another idea is that sleep helps us learn new things. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to process what we learn during the day. A third idea is that sleep gives us energy. We need to rest to recharge our bodies and have enough energy for the next day.'

'Eccentrics are people who do things that are not normal. But what is normal? We all have our own quirks and things we like to do. Some people love to enter competitions, collect things, or write letters to the newspapers. Being eccentric means being yourself and doing what you want. But often, we feel a strong desire to fit in and be like everyone else. This is because we want to be accepted and loved.
People who have unusual hobbies or opinions often join clubs or groups to meet others like them. They want to share their interests and talk about them with others. The important thing is that they are not alone.
We all have a mix of two feelings inside us: the desire to be individual and the desire to fit in. We may want to stand out, but we also want to be accepted. This can cause a conflict within us.
Some people are very good at being themselves and doing what they want. They don't worry about what others think. But being eccentric is not just about being different. It's about being natural and doing what comes naturally to you.
Eccentrics are not people who try to be odd to get attention. They are just being themselves. They don't think about what others will think. They do what they do because that's who they are.'

""Wildlife Books
We asked four famous naturalists to tell us about the book that has had the biggest influence on them. One of them is a woman named Barbara Ward. She was a big expert on the environment and wrote many important books. One of her most important books is called ""The Home of Man"". It's about the growth of cities and how we can live in harmony with nature.
Another naturalist, Niko Tinbergen, wrote a book called ""Signals for Survival"". It's about how animals communicate with each other. The book is full of pictures and words that explain how animals work together. It's a fascinating book that shows how animals are not just random creatures, but have a social structure.
Gerald Durrell, a famous conservationist, wrote a book called ""My Family and Other Animals"". It's a story about his family and the animals they lived with. It's a heartwarming book that shows how animals and people can live together.
James Fisher wrote a book called ""The Shell Bird Book"". It's a book about birds, with beautiful pictures by Eric Ennion. The book is not just about identifying birds, but also about the history of birds, music, literature, and art. It's a book that shows how birds are connected to many different areas of life.
These books have all had a big impact on the lives of these naturalists. They have inspired them to work hard to protect the natural world and to appreciate the beauty and wonder of nature.""

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five big British publishers about the importance of book reviews for a book's success. Here is what they said.
Publisher A Reviews are very important for us. A long time ago, a study found that many people buy a book because of a good review. Authors and publishers both want to see good reviews, but publishers are more relaxed about bad reviews. They think that some negative and some positive reviews can actually help sales.
Publisher B Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to sell books. Book reviewing is better now than it was 40 years ago, but there are still problems. Some books, like paperbacks, don't get enough attention.
Publisher C Reviews are essential for publishers like us. We need reviews to let readers know about our books. When a review is good, it can really help sell a book.
Publisher D The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is confusing. In the US, a good review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops don't seem to pay much attention to reviews. Some books that are not well-reviewed can still be very popular.
Publisher E Of course, everyone wants good reviews, but do they really sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but the book didn't sell well. Some people thought they could read the reviews instead of buying the book.

'WEATHERVANE MAKER Graham Smith is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. He creates unique and personalized designs for his customers. Graham's designs are not just traditional cockerels, but also animals, people, and objects that represent the customer's interests.

Nicholas Evans, a British screenwriter, wrote a book called The Horse Whisperer. Before it was even published, it was a huge success. He talks about how he got the idea for the book and how it became a bestseller.
At the beginning of the year, Evans had a tough time. A film project he was working on fell through, and he was worried about money. He had been without a job for two years and was struggling to pay his bills. Instead of getting a job, he decided to take a risk and go to America for three months to research his first novel.
The idea for the book came from a conversation he had with a farrier (a person who takes care of horses) on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a horse that had become mean and aggressive, but then a gypsy (a member of a nomadic group) came and talked to the horse, and it became calm again. Evans was fascinated by this story and decided to write a book about it.
He spent the spring driving across the US, learning about horses and the people who work with them. He was alone and felt like his life was falling apart. He had tried to make it as a filmmaker for ten years, but it wasn't working out.
When he got back home, he wrote the first half of the book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent, and he thought it was good enough to get a small advance. But Evans needed more money to pay off his debts and keep going. He wrote the rest of the book and sent it to seven publishers.
Within a week, his agent called to say that one of the publishers had offered a record-breaking advance of $750,000. The book was a huge success, and Evans became a famous author. He was offered a lot of money to write the screenplay, but he decided not to do it. He wanted to keep writing novels and not work for the film industry.

'Bobby Fischer is back in the chess world after 20 years. He's playing his old rival, Boris Spassky, and won the first game. However, Fischer is now 49 years old and out of practice. Spassky is also older. The game has changed a lot since Fischer's time. It's now a professional sport, and the focus is on winning rather than just playing well. Players need to be good at strategy, but also have strong nerves and stamina. The game is becoming longer and more intense, which makes it harder for older players to compete. Most top players are now under 30 years old. Computers have also changed the game. Players can now study hundreds of games and find weaknesses in their opponents' strategies. This makes it harder for older players to prepare. The chess world has never had so many top players. Grandmasters compete for small prizes, and success requires both mental and physical effort. A game can last up to eight hours, and players need to stay focused to win. Losing is very difficult for top players, but winning brings great satisfaction. However, to win a tournament, players need to be ready to play every day, which can be exhausting. Can Bobby Fischer still win? He once said he just wanted to play chess, but now he's back for the money. Whatever happens, he'll earn millions.'

Volunteer tourism Four experts discuss the topic of international voluntary work. A. It's difficult to say that volunteering really helps developing countries. Volunteers often pay a lot of money to participate, money that could be used to pay for more work if it was given directly to the community. This is especially true for gap years, where volunteers don't need special skills. Some people think that gap year volunteering might not be motivated by a genuine desire to help others, but rather by the desire to gain an advantage in their future careers. B. Volunteering can lead to better understanding between countries, better conflict resolution, and more people participating in global issues through organizations. It can also create a network of people from different countries. In this case, the benefits go beyond what individual volunteers and host communities gain. C. However, international volunteering can also be a way for people from wealthy countries to feel good about themselves while doing nothing to really help others. It can be a way for them to gain experience and skills that will help them in their careers. At its best, volunteering can provide technical assistance and exchange skills, knowledge, and experiences between communities. It can also raise awareness of the problems of poverty and inequality. D. Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others, which can be appealing in today's world. However, it can also avoid dealing with the bigger issues of poverty and inequality. Some people think that volunteer tourism is just a way to feel good about oneself, rather than really making a difference.

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To help them get out of bed, they use a clock radio. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, which included myself and two other people, tested five different models. We looked at a model that has a ""dual alarm function"". This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. However, the instructions say you should use this function to set two different times, not to wake up and then sleep for a bit longer. We thought this was a bit silly.
This model is quite big and has a cassette player. You can listen to your own music before you go to sleep and wake up to the radio without any news. We all thought the radio quality was very good, but the clock radio was too big.
One of our panel members, Paul, loved this model. He thought it was the best and loved the way it looked. Another panel member, Tom, thought the clock was a bit tricky to set up, but he liked the design. I thought the digital display was nice, with its green numbers and grey background. The snooze button was easy to use, even with your eyes closed.
This model has a special feature that keeps the clock working even if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. However, setting it up was a bit tricky. Tom thought the instructions were hard to understand and he had to read them twice. Paul thought the lamp that came with the clock was a bit silly and didn't work very well. The buzzer was a bit loud and woke us up easily.
We also tested a simpler and cheaper model. This one was easy to set up and took up less space. It had an old-fashioned dial to tune the radio, which Tom liked because it was more intuitive. The radio quality was good, but the tuning was a bit crude. The buzzer worked well and woke us up easily.

'Hedgehogs are small mammals with sharp spines all over their bodies. They live in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a ball when they feel threatened, so their spines point outwards. This helps keep them safe. The more spines a hedgehog has, the better it can protect itself. Some hedgehogs in the desert have fewer spines, so they might try to run away from danger instead. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep a lot during the day, often in bushes or under the ground. Some hedgehogs can sleep all year round if the conditions are right, but others like to hibernate during the winter.'

C. Annabel, 26, Rower

D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker
I've always loved walking long distances. I walked across Australia and got a record. It was very hard, but I had to do it to get sponsorship. Some people think women are more likely to fail, so they're less likely to sponsor us.

One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch with his wife and some friends. I was surprised because he was known to be a private person. I had a sketchbook with me, and I asked him if I could draw him. He agreed and even added a drawing of his own. Then, he asked me to draw his portrait. I was nervous, but he was very playful and made funny faces. I tried my best, but he made it difficult by acting out silly poses. After a while, he relaxed and let me draw him normally. I was impressed by his youthful appearance and his piercing eyes. He seemed a bit distant, but also very focused on his own thoughts. When he finished my drawing, he added his signature. I was grateful for the experience and felt lucky to have met him.

**Talking Shop**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more things than you planned to? Shops use tricks to make you spend money. Here are some of their secrets:
**Fresh and Clean**
Supermarkets know that people like to buy fresh food. They put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance or display them with plants. They also make sure the bakery smells delicious to make you want to buy more. The colors they use, like green, make you feel like you're buying healthy food.
**Displaying Products**
The way products are placed in the store is important. Supermarkets use computers to see which products people buy most often. They put these products in easy-to-reach places. They also put special offers in places where people tend to look.
**Spreading Out**
Supermarkets put everyday items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. You have to walk past other products to get to them. This way, you see more things you might want to buy.
**Less is More**
Some stores make their products look special by putting them on fewer shelves. This makes you think the products are exclusive. The store's design is also important. It makes you want to buy more.
**The Total Bill**
Food shoppers care more about how much they spend overall than how much each item costs. Supermarkets put a mix of cheap and expensive products together to make you spend more.
**Pricing**
Chain stores put a lot of thought into pricing. They make sure the prices are just right to make you buy. They also use special prices to attract customers.
**Lighting**
Stores pay attention to lighting. Chain stores want it to be like natural light so you can see the colors of the clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make food look more appealing.
**Paths and Promotions**
Some stores divide their floors with different carpets. This makes you walk along a path and then into the sales area. Some stores use wood or marble for the paths to make you feel more welcome.
**In-Store Advertising**
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of food that looks delicious. Some stores even have special trolleys with screens that show you ads as you shop. This is designed to make you buy more things on impulse.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. People have been eating them since prehistoric times. They even grew them in ancient Britain and the Swiss Alps. The apples were small and not like the ones we know today.
In the Middle Ages, people in Europe learned how to grow apples from the Romans. They brought new varieties to Britain and started growing them in monasteries. The monks experimented with different apples and created new ones. These apples are the ancestors of the apples we eat today.
In the 13th century, many types of apples were grown in Britain. One popular variety was the Old English Pearmain, which was sweet and delicious. Another variety was the Costard, which was used for cooking. The name ""costermonger"" comes from the way it was sold in the streets.
In the 16th century, Henry VIII ordered a fruit expert to visit France and learn about growing apples. This expert brought back new varieties, including the famous Pippin, which was grown in an orchard in Kent.
When people sailed to new countries, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. In North America, a man named John Chapman, also known as Johnny Appleseed, planted apple seeds and grew new trees.
In the 19th century, a farmer in Iowa discovered a new apple variety that was delicious. It was named the Delicious apple and became very popular. Another famous apple variety was discovered by a woman named Maria Smith in Australia. She found a small tree growing in a pile of discarded fruit and transplanted it. The tree grew and produced green apples, which became famous all over the world.
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but many varieties have been lost. Some people are working to save the old varieties and promote diversity in apples. We need to value and protect natural diversity in food to benefit everyone.

The camp is located near the top of a mountain, 10 miles south of the equator. Richard had been to Kenya before, but this was his first time training with Kenyan runners. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in a race.
The camp is simple, with athletes living in dormitories and eating basic food like bread and eggs. The training schedule is demanding, with three runs a day, including a long one on Sundays. The runners also have time to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.
Richard was impressed by the Kenyan runners' dedication and passion for their sport. He realized that their success is not just due to their high altitude training, but also to their simple and uncomplicated approach to running. They love competing and enjoy the mountainside lifestyle.

Advertising is not working well. It's not just because of the economic crisis. Advertising has been declining since 1989, even before the crisis started. The problem is that advertisers are not adapting to the changing economy. They still think about big groups of people and big media, but nowadays, there are many smaller groups and more media options. This means that even big brands are not targeting the right people.
Think about your own shopping habits. You buy many things, but most of them are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. Over a year, you probably buy less than 400 different brands. Compare this to the 32,500 brands that are advertised. It's clear that most advertising is wasted.
When you watch TV, you might see one or two commercials for brands you buy or might buy. But the rest are probably wasted. You might think you're special and not affected by advertising, but most people are not. In reality, nobody buys most of the advertised brands.
Advertising has to reach many people to find the right ones. But it's hard to know who will respond. Even direct mail shots don't always work. Media advertising is cheap, but it's not perfect. It's like trying to hit a target with a big net. You might catch some people, but many will slip through.
To make advertising more effective, it needs to be more targeted. The goal is to reach a small group of people who will respond. Any campaign that can reach 2% of the population is very successful. But for now, advertising is stuck in a rut, and it needs to change."

Meet Charles Clover, a man who lives in an eco-friendly house in Nottinghamshire, England. The house is special because it is very good for the environment. The first thing you notice is the ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, which is not well-known. The second thing is the house itself, which is called the 'autonomous house'. The owners, Robert and Brenda Vale, designed and built it themselves. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and they recycle their sewage to make compost for their garden. They even heat their house using waste heat from their appliances and their own body heat.
The house looks like a traditional house with clay tiles on the roof, but it's actually very modern. You can't hear any noise inside because of the special windows that keep the sound out. Inside, it's very quiet and peaceful. The Vales are very serious about the environment and have written a book about eco-friendly architecture. They designed their house to be carbon neutral and to use very little water. They even have composting toilets and collect rainwater from the roof.
The house is very efficient and uses very little energy. The Vales don't pay any water bills and their electricity bills are very low. They will soon have solar panels installed to generate even more electricity. The house is warm in the winter because of its special insulation and the wood-burning stove in the hall.

In the past, blacksmiths were like doctors and astrologers because they made important things like weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also considered artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. In the past, French and Belgian architects used blacksmiths to make intricate metalwork for their buildings.
In the past, blacksmiths were not needed much in Britain because big industries didn't need them, and architects didn't want to use iron for decoration. However, in the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in blacksmithing. People are now more interested in decorative architecture and design, and blacksmiths are making things again.
There is an exhibition at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey, featuring ironwork made by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association. The exhibition has over 250 pieces, including bookends, a spiral staircase, and other items. The prices start at PS90 and go up to over PS1,000. The money raised will go to the blacksmiths who made the items and also to the association to promote good ironwork.
The blacksmiths are excited about their work because they have new tools that make it easier for them to shape and bend the metal. They can create beautiful and interesting things using iron. One blacksmith says that working with iron is like drawing with metal in space. Another blacksmith says that iron is magical because it is soft when it's hot, but hard when it's cold.
The exhibition is a chance to see the beautiful things that blacksmiths can make. It's also a chance to appreciate the importance of iron in our lives."

'I QUIT SMOKING AND PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED. One of my colleagues was very angry. ""Why did you stop now and not earlier?"" she asked. I couldn't explain why I suddenly stopped smoking after being a heavy smoker for years. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnosis. It was two months ago. I didn't plan to stop and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the pressure from people who don't smoke. I also thought I was healthy because I had low blood pressure and a long-lived family. I didn't get sick easily and recovered quickly from colds. I went to the session to write an article about people who try to quit smoking. I told the counsellor I wasn't going to try to quit, just write about others who were. The counsellor looked at me knowingly. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was very smoky. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to as much as I used to. It was like the idea of not smoking became more appealing. I felt powerful when I thought about not being a smoker. It was a secret feeling that was just between me and myself. It was easy to stop smoking. The cravings went away after a few days. I thought I would have trouble working without cigarettes, but it wasn't a problem. The hardest thing for me was doing nothing on weekends, like I used to do. I miss cigarettes, but not too much. Now I have to get used to new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane.'

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won the Nobel Prize. You would expect her to be famous in the UK, but many people don't know about her. I've been asking my friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them don't know who she is.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a remarkable person who worked on many important scientific projects. She was a pioneer for women's education and helped to globalize science. Her life was affected by big changes in the 20th century.
I wanted to learn more about her, so I read some scientific biographies. I found that many scientists don't like to talk about their personal lives, which makes their biographies boring. This is because scientists are often seen as being different from artists and writers. However, scientists can have interesting lives, just like anyone else.
In recent years, scientists have become more open about their personal lives. Some have even written books about themselves. This has helped to make scientists more relatable and interesting to the public.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a devoted scientist who worked on many important projects. She solved the structure of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which earned her the Nobel Prize. She also had a family and was married to a historian. Her personal life is not directly related to her work, but it's interesting to see how she balanced her work and family life.
It's sad that many people don't know about Dorothy Hodgkin and her achievements. It's important to learn about scientists like her, as they have contributed so much to our understanding of the world.

Margaret Wilkins is known for her special ability to find water. She can use a forked hazel rod to detect water underground. Many farmers whose wells have dried up come to her for help. She works with her husband, who runs a well-drilling business. They use special equipment, but Margaret relies on her'sixth sense' to locate water.
There are different theories about how dowsing works. Some people think it's because everything on Earth vibrates, and dowsers can sense these vibrations. Others believe it's a spiritual ability. Margaret and her husband have a high success rate, over 90%. They have a long waiting list, especially during droughts.
Margaret's customers are mostly farmers, but also people who own holiday homes or golf courses. She tries to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She looks for fissures in rock and makes sure the water is safe and clean. She also needs electricity to pump the water, so she looks for areas with existing power supplies.
To find water, Margaret starts by looking at a map and using a pendulum. Then, she walks over the fields with her hazel stick. When she's above water, she feels a strange sensation and uses the stick to locate the exact spot to drill. Her husband does the same, and they usually agree on the spot. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they do.
Margaret's ability to find water is not just a local phenomenon. Scientists and writers have studied it for a long time. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment"", and that's the closest we can get to understanding how she does it."

Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player from Sweden. He comes from a family without music, but he started playing the trumpet at the age of 8. His father gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present, and he never stopped playing. Hakan's teacher, Bo Nilsson, was a professional trumpet player who helped him develop his skills. Hakan's unique sound is due to his ability to find the right compromise with the instrument and its imperfections.
Hakan's parents supported his dream of becoming a solo artist. He admired the French trumpet player Maurice Andre and wanted to follow in his footsteps. At 16, he went to study in Paris with Pierre Thibaud, who confirmed that Hakan's talent was not suitable for playing in an orchestra. Instead, Hakan entered a competition and won, realizing that he had a special gift for communicating with the audience.
Hakan's humility and realism about his work and career are reflected in his quotes. He believes that the power of music lies in its ability to move people, and he doesn't try to analyze what makes his communication with the audience special.

**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires others and helps them to achieve their goals. It's not about being tall or smart, but about being enthusiastic and confident. A good leader can motivate others and make them feel important.
According to Pat Dixon, a leader should be able to speak clearly and with conviction. They should also be able to make things happen by involving others who are just as enthusiastic and interested.
John van Maurik, a leadership expert, says that most people have the potential to be leaders, but they need to recognize and develop their skills. We are all born with the ability to lead, but we need the right circumstances to help us grow.
When thinking about leadership, we often think of famous leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst or Richard Branson. But leadership is also important in our daily work lives. A good leader can motivate and support their team, while a bad leader can make people feel unimportant and uninvolved.
Managers and leaders are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path. A good leader can transform a company or team, while a good manager can keep things running smoothly.
If you want to improve your leadership skills, here are some tips:
* Find what you are passionate about and take the lead.
* Think of yourself as a leader and recognize your abilities.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from mistakes.
* Communicate effectively and be open to feedback.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but also know when to step back and let others take the lead.
Remember, leadership is not just about being in charge, but about making a positive impact on others."

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects. A photo with someone in it is usually more interesting than a photo without. But people are also the hardest to take a good photo of. You need to think about their actions, gestures, and expressions. And sometimes the camera can make them feel uncomfortable.
**Taking Group Photos**
When taking a group photo, try not to have everyone stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so everyone's face is visible.
**Posing for Photos**
When someone is taking a photo of you, they might feel stiff and unnatural. Try to help them relax by suggesting a comfortable position. You can suggest they put their hands in their pockets or fold their arms.
**The Right Approach**
Don't pretend you're not taking a photo when you are. This can make people feel uncomfortable and even angry. Most people are happy to have their photo taken and are flattered by it. But they might feel self-conscious and need some direction.
**Eye Contact**
A photo is more interesting if the person in it is looking directly at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. This will give you a good photo.
**Candid Concentration**
An alternative to direct eye contact is to have the person concentrate on something in the photo. This can be easier for them and make the photo more interesting.
**Expressions and Gestures**
The expressions and gestures of the person in the photo can tell us more about them than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiling, laughing, or frowning.
**Situational Interest**
The background or environment of the photo can add interest and tell us more about the person. Try to exclude details that are not important to the person and make sure they are not overwhelmed by the background.
**Interaction**
Photos of people interacting with each other, like talking, arguing, or working together, can be very interesting. Look for eye contact or physical contact between the people in the photo.
**People and Places**
Photos of people in different places, like on holiday, can be interesting if taken well. Try to show the person against a relevant background and use a standard or wide-angle lens to get the whole scene in the frame.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the photo. If you want a good clear photo, you might ask the person to pose. But if you want a more natural photo, you might prefer to take it on the spur of the moment.

'Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success
The rules for work are changing. Now, we are not just judged by how smart we are or how well we do our job. We are also judged by how well we work with others. This is important when choosing who to hire or promote. The new rules help us know who will be good at their job and who might not be. These rules are not about being good at school or being clever. They are about having good 'people skills', like being able to work well with others, being friendly and understanding, and being able to talk to people in a way that works.
In the past, it was not important to have these skills. But now, with more people working together and having to deal with customers, these skills are very important. Companies that have people who are good at working with others do better than those that don't.
Emotional intelligence is not just about being nice all the time. It's about being able to control your own feelings and the feelings of others. It's about being able to work well with others and make good decisions. This skill can be learned and grown as we get older and have more experiences. It's like growing up and becoming more mature.
Having good emotional intelligence is not a magic solution to all problems. But it can help us work better with others and be more successful in our jobs. And that's important in today's world where jobs are not always secure.'

Acupuncture is an old Chinese medicine that is over 2,000 years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which includes many different ways to stay healthy, such as taking herbs, getting massages, eating well, and exercising. Acupuncture is used to treat many different health problems, but doctors in the West are most interested in its use for pain relief.
Traditional Chinese medicine thinks that health is when the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. This balance is called Qi. Qi flows through the body along special paths called meridians. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, the body can become unwell. Acupuncturists try to find where the Qi is blocked and use special needles to help it flow again.
There are over 300 points on the body where the needles are placed. These points are related to the meridians and are not always near the area of pain. People often feel a gentle tingling sensation when the needle is inserted. This shows that the needle has reached the Qi.
Some doctors in the West have accepted that acupuncture can work for pain relief, even if they don't believe in the traditional Chinese theory. They think it might work because it can stimulate nerves and release natural pain-relieving substances.
Acupuncture can be used to treat many types of pain, including back pain, headaches, and arthritis. Some people use it as a last resort when other treatments haven't worked. Acupuncture is also used in some operations instead of anesthesia. This is a relatively new development, and it has helped convince some doctors that acupuncture is more than just a placebo.
It's hard to know how well acupuncture works because it's difficult to run clinical trials. However, most people who try acupuncture find it helpful for chronic pain. Acupuncturists usually need to see patients several times before they start to feel relief.
Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They try to find the underlying causes of the pain and take into account factors like the weather and the person's lifestyle. This is different from Western medicine, which often focuses on just the symptoms.
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others don't believe in traditional Chinese theory. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that this approach is the only way to bring about lasting changes. It's important to choose an acupuncturist carefully and to get a referral to a doctor if necessary.

The study of handwriting can tell us a lot about a person's character. In some countries, employers ask job applicants to write a sample of their handwriting as part of the hiring process. This can be more important than other qualifications. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a recognized science in many countries. Researchers believe it can help diagnose certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and reveal a person's mental state.
Many big companies use graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential employees. These experts can tell us about a person's personality, intelligence, and potential. They can even predict whether someone is likely to be honest or dishonest. Graphologists can also detect signs of mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety.
Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist, believes that handwriting can reveal a lot about a person's background and personality. She says that people from deprived backgrounds often have poor handwriting, and those who are more intelligent or artistic may have more creative handwriting. She also claims that graphology can be used to predict whether someone is likely to commit a crime or even commit suicide.
However, not all experts agree with these claims. Some doctors and psychiatrists say that handwriting is influenced by education and artistic ability, and has no deeper meaning. They argue that graphology is not a reliable method for making predictions about a person's character or behavior.

**Is your office a happy place to work?**
A new survey says that fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workforce. We visited four different offices to see how happy and healthy they were. We had a team of experts to help us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**
This office is very simple. There is no central heating or air conditioning, and the windows open directly onto the street. But the people who work here are very happy. They make their own adjustments to the temperature and lighting. The team is small and close-knit, and they don't have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy.
**Office B: News Service**
This office is comfortable and well-maintained. The air is good, and the staff don't smoke inside. The chairs are good, and the lighting and computers are also good. However, the office is a bit impersonal and could be more stimulating.
**Office C: Bank**
This office is a bit mixed. It's like being in a glass case, with many similar offices around. The air is good, even when there are smokers nearby. The staff are supportive and well-equipped with technology. However, the office is a bit standard and uninspiring.
**Office D: Newspaper**
This office is difficult to work in. The air conditioning is not good, and the space is cluttered. The desks are small, and the office is very dusty. The chairs are not good for people who use computers, and the office needs a lot of improvement.

'Chewing gum is very popular in the United States. Americans chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. Chewing gum has a long history. The ancient Greeks chewed a type of gum made from the bark of a special tree. Women in Greece liked to chew this gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. In the United States, people used to chew gum made from the resin that forms on spruce trees. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
In the 1800s, people started to make gum from chicle, a milky substance from a tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more fun to chew. Soon, many companies started making gum using chicle. However, it was hard to grow the trees, so companies started making synthetic gum instead.
Today, only a few people still gather chicle from the trees. They have to work in very difficult conditions, with snakes and insects around them. They have to climb the trees and carry the chicle back to their camp. Life is hard, but they are worried about their jobs because many companies are now using synthetic gum instead.
Gum manufacturers say that chewing gum can help keep your teeth healthy by increasing saliva flow. They are always looking for new ways to make gum, like new textures and flavors. Some flavors still need natural ingredients, while others are made artificially. The United States has a lot of land dedicated to growing mint, which is used in many popular gum flavors.'

The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown checks hotels for a living. She visited the Globe Hotel to see how it was doing. From the start, things didn't go well. The receptionist was not very friendly and didn't even notice Sue and her colleague. Sue was not happy. She said, ""This is not what I expected from a three-star hotel.""
The hotel's car park was hard to find, and the entrance was not very welcoming. When they got inside, the receptionist couldn't find their booking. Sue was not impressed. She saw that many rooms were empty, including one on the top floor. She didn't like it because it was stuffy and had a big hole in the wall.
Sue has been an inspector for 11 years. She used to be known as ""The Woman in Black"" because she was tough, but she says she's not that tough. The next morning, she told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, about all the things that needed to be fixed. He was very sorry and promised to do better.
Some things were good, like the assistant manager, Emma, and the waitress, Trudy, who told them about the hotel's history. The food was also good, so the hotel kept its two-rosette rating. Sue told Greaves that to get three rosettes, they should improve the pudding. Greaves was not happy about that.
Sue's job is to tell hotels what they need to do to improve. Sometimes, hotel owners get upset and even send mean letters. Sue has to be honest, even if it's hard. She writes a report after her visit and gives it to the hotel. The hotel has to pay to be included in the guide, but it's worth it because it helps them get more customers.
The good news for the Globe Hotel is that Sue won't take away their red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back soon to make sure they have fixed all the problems."

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)
Dougal and I climbed Mt. McKinley, the most difficult mountain in the world. We carried our equipment and food up the mountain. We decided to climb without extra help, which was a big challenge. We were tired and cold, but we made it to the top.
C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)
I climbed Kilimanjaro with my friend Paul. We got lost in the jungle, but found a trail and continued climbing. We had to find water, which was scarce. We saw strange signs and followed them to a rock pool. We climbed the mountain in a different way than planned.
D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
I climbed Aconcagua with my wife Sharu. We joined a group of climbers who were taking a different route. We had to hurry to get back in time for our flight. We walked to the top and camped outside the refuge.

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants are wild and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path are very beautiful because of the harmony of colors, shapes, and structures. This is thanks to the previous owners, who were keen gardeners, and Danny, the gardener she inherited. Susan likes to focus on detailed studies of individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She takes flowers from the garden to her studio and paints them one by one. It can take a few days or even years to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times, when the tulips and poppies bloom. She loves watching the flowers change shape and color over time. Susan has always been interested in plants and used to collect wild flowers as a child. Now, her garden has plants from all around the world, but she doesn't worry too much about how they grow. She's too busy preparing for her next exhibitions to spend much time in the garden, so she's hired an extra gardener to help. But she knows that to stay inspired, she needs to get her hands dirty.

He had bronchitis and was in bed for a few days. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he didn't want to leave work. Eventually, a colleague took him to the doctor, and he was given antibiotics. When he finally felt better, he was shocked to see that the storm had changed the look of his living room. The walnut tree in his garden had been knocked down, and it had changed the way the room looked. The room was now very bright, and the old furniture looked worn out. The house next door, which was previously hidden by the tree, was now visible, and it was not very nice. Pelham didn't like the new look, but his wife thought they should buy a new sofa to fix the problem.'

We had been living in our valley for 16 months when we realized the dangers that could affect our survival. The year was unusual, with early storms and heavy snowfall. The snow was deep in the hills and blocked our lane. We were safe in our valley, but we knew we had to be careful. The river, the Ryburn, was a concern. It's a river that normally flows gently, but it could be dangerous if the snowmelt and rain caused it to overflow. We watched as the snow melted and the river filled up. The water was getting higher and higher, and we were worried. For the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed, and the river became wild and deep. It was like a mini Niagara Falls! The water was rushing down the stream, and we were worried it would flood our home. We prayed it would stay below the dam, and luckily, it did. The dam controls the river's flow, so we don't have to worry about flooding. We can enjoy the big clouds and the power of the river without fear. Thanks to the dam, we feel safe in our valley.

I'm Mark Adams, a film critic for The Front Page newspaper. This is my first job as a film critic. Before this, I did some reviewing for other newspapers, magazines, and radio. I met Tom Seaton, the arts editor of The Front Page, who had also worked in radio and TV. He hired me, but he wasn't a journalist, so he didn't always make the best choices. At first, his idea was to have a team of critics for different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would meet weekly to discuss what we would cover, and there would be guests to make it more social. It felt like a dream to start a new newspaper and be part of the team. But it was hard to believe that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market.
Unfortunately, Tom's plan didn't work out. We didn't work together as a team, and everything was done over the phone. People preferred to associate a reviewer with a specific area, so I focused on film. Without Tom's help, we might not have ended up with the current arrangement, where I write a weekly article about one film. I prefer this way of working because it gives me the freedom to express my opinions and make my own choices.
I don't think my role is to tell people what films to see or not to see. People usually choose films based on the stars, the trailer, or the director. It's rare for someone to change their mind about a film because of a review. So, what is the purpose of a film review? I don't feel responsible for being 'right' about a movie. I just try to make an argument. I'm not a judge, and I don't want to be one.

'I love collecting things and so do many other people. In fact, one in three adults enjoys collecting. It's a world of passion, excitement, and joy. But remember, if you don't fall in love with an object, don't collect it. People have been collecting things for thousands of years. Even ancient people collected pebbles and seashells because they liked their shapes and colors. I've been collecting things all my life. I started with stones from my parents' garden and then moved on to flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was of stones, and I was fascinated by the objects in a museum when I was a child. I'm not the only one who likes collecting things. Many people do it. Some people collect because it's the only part of their life where they have complete control. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing. Some famous people have big collections. The Duc de Berry in France had a room full of strange and interesting objects. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I've collected all sorts of things, from tulip bulbs to china cups. I even collected 350 American rag dolls. But one day, a fire destroyed my collection. It was very sad. The way collections change hands and the value of objects increases is very interesting to me. For example, a spoon that once belonged to a king or a famous poet can be very valuable. The toys from the 1950s are now valuable too, as long as you kept the original boxes.'

We always go to Ireland in June. We have been going there for many years, and every year we spend the first two weeks at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house near the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The owners, the Malseeds, made some changes to the house, but they did it quietly. Our friend Strafe found the house for us. He saw an advertisement and thought it would be perfect for us. We had gone on holiday the year before, but it wasn't great because the food was terrible. We've been friends with Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me (my name is Milly, but my friends call me Milly) for a long time. We all live near the same town where the Malseeds used to live in England before they moved to Ireland. It's a coincidence that we all ended up living so close.
When we arrived at Glencorn Lodge, Mrs. Malseed was waiting for us in the big hall. She always seems to know when we're arriving. She welcomed us warmly and showed us to our rooms. The rooms are named after flowers, and Mrs. Malseed painted the names on the doors. Her husband, Mr. Malseed, was also there and greeted us with a big smile. He said ""A hundred thousand welcomes"" to us, which is an Irish way of saying ""welcome"". We all felt happy and relaxed.
After dinner, we played cards for a bit, but we were still tired from our journey. There were other people at the hotel, including a man and a French couple. The next day, we would walk along the beach and have coffee in the village, and then go on a drive in the afternoon. This is what we usually do when we're at Glencorn Lodge.

I get up at 7am to walk to the chalet, where I live. I have breakfast and then prepare breakfast for the guests. They get a big breakfast with lots of food. After breakfast, I clean the rooms or make tea for the guests.
When the guests are gone, I go skiing as much as I can. I usually ski until 4:30pm. After that, I come back to the chalet to prepare dinner. I serve dinner at 8pm and then clean up.
Sometimes I stay and chat with the guests, but other times they like to be alone. Some weeks are better than others, but I always try to make sure the chalet is clean and tidy.
On Sundays, I work extra hard to get everything ready for the new guests. I do the shopping and clean the chalet until it's spotless. Then, I prepare tea for the new guests and take them to the ski shop if they need help with their equipment.

Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down!' He jumped, and the others followed. They all laughed and rolled around in the sawdust. After a while, they went back up to the roof and jumped again.

Are you unhappy in your job? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people want to change their job, but don't know how. One way is to talk to a careers adviser. You'll write about yourself and take some tests. The tests show what jobs you might be good at and what skills you need to learn. I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. The tests were like a science exam. I had to answer questions quickly with a group of people. It was hard to understand how the tests would show what I'm good at. The tests asked me to find mistakes and match shapes. Then, I talked to an adviser and got a report with my results. I agreed with most of what the adviser said, but I was surprised to see that I didn't do well in science and technical tests. I'm glad I didn't become a nurse! It was good to know that I made the right decision about being a journalist.
You don't have to change your career completely. Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager and went to Career Analysts for help. She was surprised to find out she was good at design. But she had to think about the cost of retraining and her financial situation. She decided to use her existing skills and move to a job that was better for her. Now she's a Public Relations officer.
Some people find careers advice very helpful. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and made some big decisions. She was unhappy with her job at a bank and didn't know what she wanted to do. She took some tests and had four sessions with an adviser. The tests showed she was interested in science, and after the last session, she decided to study geology and start a degree course later this year. She thinks the advice was worth the cost.
However, not everyone finds careers advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, 24, went to a careers adviser, but didn't find it useful. She didn't like the ideas she was given because they required a lot of retraining or a pay cut. She thought her friend could have given her the same advice if she had told them about herself."

Imagine walking into a dentist's office that feels more like a relaxing spa than a medical clinic. This is what W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in Glasgow is like. The walls are decorated with bright paintings and there's a comfortable blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says that many people only visit the dentist when they have a problem, because they're afraid. He wants to change this.
To make patients feel more at ease, Jerome doesn't wear a white coat. He thinks this can make people feel anxious. Instead, he wants to create a relaxing atmosphere where people enjoy their visit. To do this, he has introduced some new techniques, like virtual reality headsets. These let patients watch a film while he examines their teeth. The headsets are very popular!
The surgery also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Jerome wants patients to feel like they're in a different kind of place. He takes his work very seriously, but he also thinks that making patients feel comfortable is important. For example, he uses a special instrument that sprays warm water on the teeth instead of scraping them. It might feel strange at first, but it's not painful if you're relaxed.
Jerome has even been to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. He found that when patients are happy, it makes it easier for the dentist to do their job. He wants to make dental visits more enjoyable for everyone. When you visit his surgery, you'll feel like you're in a luxurious beauty salon rather than a dentist's office.

'Chocolate is a popular treat that has been enjoyed for thousands of years. It started in South America, where the Aztecs and Mayans grew a special tree called the cacao tree. The fruit of this tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate. The Aztecs used these seeds as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in their language. They added spices and drank it on special occasions.
In the past, people in Europe didn't like the bitter taste of chocolate, so they added sugar and cinnamon to make it sweeter. Chocolate houses were popular in big cities, where people would gather to drink the drink.
In the 19th century, a man named CJ van Houten invented a way to make chocolate powder, which made it easier to make chocolate. A company in Bristol, England, called Fry and Sons, created the first solid chocolate bar in 1847. Later, a Swiss company added milk to the chocolate, making milk chocolate.
In Britain, Cadbury was a well-known chocolate company that made a famous bar called Dairy Milk. They even named their factory Bournville, which means 'town' in French. Today, people in Britain eat an average of four chocolate bars a week. To attract more customers, chocolate companies are now making new products like chocolate ice cream and chocolate drinks.
However, many cacao farmers are still struggling because of a drop in the price of cocoa beans in the 1980s. Many small-scale farmers were forced to stop farming. So, next time you eat a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grew the cocoa beans.'

Peter Cooke is an 83-year-old artist who has become very good at making things out of shells. He started doing this 10 years ago and is still learning new techniques. He shows me his work in his apartment and is very enthusiastic about it. He has had two exhibitions in London and people like his work very much. He sells his pieces for a lot of money, up to £2,000 for some of them.
Peter never meant to sell his work, but some friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. He uses different materials like cardboard, glue, and washing-up liquid to make his creations. He has a special way of doing things and is very careful with the details. He travels to different beaches around the world to find the most beautiful shells.
Some people might think he is taking too many shells from the beach, but Peter only collects dead shells and doesn't harm the living creatures. He thinks it's okay to collect shells because the sea breaks them up anyway, and he only takes a small amount. He is very proud of his work and wishes he had started earlier so he could have made even more beautiful things.

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old model who travels to exciting places and appears on magazine covers. But when she's not working, she's just like any other student, studying for her exams. I went to interview her at the agency where she works.
When I arrived, the receptionist told me that Kira would be late. I was worried that she might not show up or would be in a bad mood. But when she arrived, she was smiling and apologetic, with her mother. She was wearing a simple dress and trainers, not fancy clothes. She seemed friendly and normal, not like the typical model I had imagined.
Kira is still in school and has to take her mother with her when she works. Her mother is proud of her and helps her with her career. Kira didn't plan to become a model, it was her sister who encouraged her to enter a competition. She won and now works with the Select model agency in London.
Kira finds it hard to balance her two lives - being a model and a student. Some of her friends are proud of her, but a few are mean and say she has an inflated opinion of herself. Kira says that's not true, she's just more confident now and can stand up for herself.
As a model, Kira's social life is affected. She can't make plans with her friends because she never knows what the next day will bring. But her friends understand and don't get upset. Kira is talented, beautiful, and has a great support system. She's already achieved a lot before she even takes her school-leaving exams. If she wasn't a model, she would like to be a journalist, like me.

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She studies the chemical processes in the sea and teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater adventures in a special vehicle that's like a small car. She dives down three kilometers to study underwater volcanoes.
The space inside the vehicle is very small, so she can almost touch the two pilots who are with her. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. The dive can take 16 hours - three hours to get to the bottom, 10 hours to collect samples, and three hours to come back up.
If there's an emergency, Rachel can press a panic button and a small escape vessel will come out and take her to the surface. She's been on six dives so far, including one with a Russian team. They went to a place with many underwater volcanoes, where they were studying a big hole that was being made in one of the volcanoes.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she does it so she can focus on her research on underwater volcanoes, also called ""black smokers"". They're like chimneys that shoot out hot water and black smoke at a rate of one meter per second.
Rachel has been scared only once, when she was on a dive with the Americans and there was an explosion. But they were okay, and it was a big relief. Rachel loves going on these underwater adventures and seeing the amazing things she's studying up close. She feels like she's the only person in the world who has ever seen them before."

'I was tired, dirty, and hungry after my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted and my mind was overwhelmed by all the new languages, timetables, and currencies. I thought, ""I'll never do this again!"" But the next year, I did the same thing. And the year after that. The best part was that I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month with just one train ticket. I had to get used to sleeping on the train and carrying my belongings in a backpack. It was a simple way to travel, but it made me realize that I didn't need many things. I could get rid of things I didn't need and be more careful with my belongings.
The Inter-Rail ticket was special because it allowed me to travel to many countries in a short time. My friends and I thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France, but we soon discovered that we could travel to many other countries without extra cost. We weren't interested in sightseeing, but we enjoyed the freedom of being on our own. We could do what we wanted and go where we wanted.
The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place for the first time. It's like the city only exists when you arrive and see it with your own eyes. Seeing Europe in person is different from just knowing about it. Everyone knows what Europe is like, but it's not the same until you experience it yourself. This is why holiday photos can be boring - they don't show the real experience. The train trip is a personal experience, and it helps you understand how big Europe is.'

'Lost luggage is a common problem when you travel by plane. It can be very frustrating to arrive at the airport and find that your bag is not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline finds your luggage. Some airlines don't tell us how often this happens, but it's true that sometimes your luggage can get lost. Even the best airlines can make mistakes. This is because they have to check in passengers and luggage at the airport, and then load the luggage onto the plane. They need to leave some time between flights for this to happen. But sometimes flights are delayed, and this can cause problems with luggage. There are also human errors that can happen, like someone accidentally taking your bag off the plane. Large airports, where many planes take off and land, are more likely to have problems with luggage. For example, Heathrow airport in London handled over 41 million passengers last year, and many of them were changing planes. Even small airports can have problems, so it's a good idea to check in early and make sure your luggage is properly labeled. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline and leave more time between flights. If your luggage still gets lost, you should report it to the airline official at the airport and fill out a special form before you leave.'

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a level B1:
The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It eats fish and has a special place in the hearts of many people. The kingfisher's home is often surrounded by old trees that hang over the water. The colours of the scene are soft and peaceful, with greens, browns, and yellows. The bird moves quickly and smoothly through the water, leaving a lasting impression.
Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who loves kingfishers. He can't explain exactly why he loves them so much, but he has been fascinated by them since he was young. In fact, he was so interested in kingfishers that he missed school to spend more time with them. He even got a job as an advisor for a nature magazine and later became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.
Charlie wants to make a film about kingfishers that shows their beauty without using any words. He loves the way the light reflects off their feathers, making them look like they're changing colour. He's been studying kingfishers for over half his life, and he still finds them exciting. His photographs show how much he cares about these birds, but there's more to his relationship with them than just his work.

**Conducting an Orchestra**
Conductors are very important people. They help musicians play music together. Five conductors share their stories with Anne Inglis.
**A. Anne Manson**
Anne Manson, 30, was asked to help a famous conductor, Claudio Abbado, in Vienna. She was surprised when she was asked to take charge of an orchestra rehearsal. She wasn't nervous because she had a positive attitude. Anne works with a London-based opera company and is also known in other European countries.
**B. Andrew Constantine**
Andrew Constantine, 31, won a big competition in 1991. He was grateful because it gave him many performance opportunities. However, he finds it hard to get rid of the ""competition"" label. He wants to be known for his own work, not just his competition win.
**C. Wasfi Kani**
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice sessions that come with opera productions. She started conducting in her late 20s and took lessons from Sian Edwards. She likes the challenges of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the singers' personalities...""
**D. Roger Vignoles**
Roger Vignoles, 48, discovered conducting by chance. He started as a musician with an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed a Handel opera from the piano for the first time. He found it easier than he thought and enjoyed it.
**E. Wayne Marshall**
Wayne Marshall, 32, was noticed by conductor Simon Rattle and soon found himself conducting a musical in London. He had to deal with some professional musicians who were not paying attention. He was firm with them and got good results. Wayne has never studied conducting formally, but people have been kind to him. He is determined and knows what he likes.

Fun Island - The Burns family
We thought Fun Island might be boring after visiting a big theme park in the US. But we were surprised! The park has lots of rides for younger children, like the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special ride for very young kids. Older kids can enjoy scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! The staff are very helpful and the park is clean and well-organized.
Wonderland - The McMillan family
None of us had been to a theme park before. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it! He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, where he could play with small replicas of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. The park has nice landscaping and friendly staff.
Adventure World - The Jeffree family
We spent seven hours at Adventure World and still didn't see everything. The kids loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line. They also enjoyed Running River, where you think you'll get wet but don't. There's something for everyone, even adults! The park is well-designed and clean, and the staff are great.
The Great Park - The Langridge family
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at five. The park is great for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. We all enjoyed Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then gets exciting. We queued for half an hour for Lightning River, but it was over before we knew it!
Fantasy World - The Break-all family
Fantasy World has lots of exciting rides, including Europe's tallest roller-coaster. The kids loved the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres above the ground! The staff were helpful, but some were friendlier than others. We needed a full day to enjoy the park.""

Running a business in the countryside
Five women talk about their experiences setting up a business in the countryside.
A. 'My customers are like friends,' says Christine Hogan, who runs a computer design business. She and her husband moved to the countryside for a better life. She worked with computers before she got married and started her own business. It was hard at first, but she was careful with money and worked at home. She can work in the evenings if she wants. Her business is small, and people usually collect their work from her.
B. 'I like being independent,' says Maggy Sasanow, who designs greetings cards. She trained as an artist and wanted to work in a museum. But after she got married, they moved to the countryside, where there wasn't that kind of work. So she started her own business and makes cards for museums. She works from home, but sometimes there's too much to do. People find her because she's cheaper than other artists.
C. 'It's been tough sometimes,' says Delia Turner, who makes curtains. She started her business eight years ago and it was doing well, but then the economy got bad and she had to let some of her employees go. Now she works from home with her husband's help and uses other women who work from their homes. She has to be careful with prices and look for new opportunities.
D. Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside for financial reasons and because she loves the country. She likes being able to work whenever she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with other countries, so she has to take calls at odd hours. The only downside is that she has to be disciplined and shut her office door.
E. Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She started at home ten years ago, making fruit cakes using good ingredients. She sent cakes to friends and relatives, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building and hired staff. Her biggest problem is the financial side of the business.

Meet the Amazing Watkins Family
The Watkins family is very special because they all love music. The two sons, Paul and Huw, are great musicians. Their father, John, makes the instruments. Not many families have a member who makes music, writes music, and plays music.
When Paul was 10 years old, he wanted to play the cello. His parents thought it would be too expensive to buy one, so John decided to make one himself. He went to school to learn how to make instruments and made Paul his first cello. Paul used it until a few months ago.
John now makes violins full-time and sells them to famous musicians. Paul and Huw were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano, but soon switched to the cello. Huw started with the piano too, but preferred to play the violin. However, he didn't like it when his brother Paul was better at it. But their parents were very supportive and relaxed.
Now, Paul is a famous cellist and has won many awards. He even played with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He has a new cello now, but his father's cello is still very special to him. Paul's brother Huw is also a musician and is starting to make a name for himself. Their parents are very proud of both sons and have to keep track of their many musical activities.

**Looking after the countryside**
The National Trust is an organization that helps protect the countryside in Britain. Gill Page visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talked to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust.
Gareth says that to be a good warden, you need to be practical and able to work with people. He has a lot of experience working on his family's farm and this helps him in his job. He also knows many local farmers and can understand their problems.
Gareth's job involves taking care of the countryside, including planting trees, building walls, and meeting with farmers. He also talks to visitors and helps them understand the importance of conservation. He used to collect flowers and animals as a child and now realizes how important it is to protect the environment.
Gareth says that farmers and conservationists used to have different ideas about how to take care of the countryside, but now they are working together. His job is to make sure that projects are finished on time and within budget.
Gareth likes his job, but sometimes has to deal with difficult people who don't understand the importance of conservation. He says that being a warden requires common sense and a willingness to work outdoors.
If you like the idea of working outdoors and have common sense, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. However, there might not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time.

I met Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team, a few weeks before the World Championships. She told me about her daily routine, which includes teaching at a local school and training in a car park. I asked her if people give her strange looks, but she said she's too focused on her training to notice.
Kendra said her whole life is now about being at her best for the World Championships. She follows a strict schedule to improve her fitness. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet with 27 teams taking part.
The team will have home support, which is special, and it's important for netball in England. As a result, there will be more pressure than usual. The team's first game is against Barbados, and Kendra thinks it will be exciting. England is currently ranked fourth in the world, but the World Championships will be tough.
Kendra said that in the 15 years she's been playing at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive, but once the game is over, they become friends again. Netball is also using science to test fitness levels. As captain, Kendra thinks it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example.
Kendra has always planned her netball career carefully, and this will be her last big event. After the championships, she might coach young players, but for now, her focus is on her last big competition. When she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.

'SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS What to do with a child who is very good at music? Not everyone knows how to help them develop their talent. Some parents may not notice their child's gift until they start to get frustrated and behave badly. Most schools are good at helping children who are very good at other subjects, but music schools are special because they understand the needs of children who are very good at music.
There are five music schools in Britain that are designed for children who are between 7 and 18 years old. These schools provide a special environment where children can learn and practice music with professional musicians. They spend most of their day doing music activities, such as individual lessons, playing in orchestras, and practicing in special rooms. They also do some schoolwork, but it's not as much as other schools. The schools are small and have a lot of teachers, so the children get a lot of attention.
The problem is that these schools are expensive, and the fees are high. However, the schools try to help parents who can't afford it by offering scholarships. Some parents don't want to send their children to boarding school, especially when they're very young. The directors of the schools think that it's better to wait until children are a bit older before sending them to a music school.
Some people think that sending children to a music school too early can be stressful. Children may lose their musical ability as they get older, and the pressure to succeed can be too much. But the schools keep an eye on each child and offer help if they need it.
Many people who went to music school think it was a great experience, but some say that the schoolwork was not good enough. Children who are very good at music and other subjects may do well in a normal school with a good music department. There are also music colleges that offer lessons and music activities on Saturdays, but this is only for families who live near the colleges.'

My wife took care of our children and did the accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant, and we always had meals together. This helped our children, Gary and Joe, become confident. They would talk to our regular customers from a young age. This gave them a great start in life.
Gary was a lively child. He used to play in the bath like it was a swimming pool and once knocked himself out. He started working for pocket money when he was older. He would help out in the kitchen every weekend and earned a lot of money. He was very disciplined and would wake up early. When he was 15, he was as good as the other chefs, and sometimes he was even in charge. I knew then that he would work in the catering industry.
Gary is now a TV chef, and I'm very proud of him. He's worked hard for his success. I always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. He's taken the opportunities he's been given and made the most of them. I'm happy that he's listened to what I've told him.'

Finding a flat in Dublin was very difficult. Jo had just moved to Dublin and didn't know anyone. She had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat on her own. She didn't know what to expect. Jo's friends from school thought it was a good idea for her to stay in a hostel. Her parents were worried about her, especially her father, who thought the hostel might be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for so long.
Jo saw an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said she could have her own room, TV, and share the kitchen and bathroom. The flat was close to her work at the post office. She was excited to see it. The flat was in an ordinary house, but it was upstairs. Jo met two girls, Nessa and Pauline, who were already living there. They were very friendly and offered Jo a cup of tea. Pauline was a punk, which was new for Jo. She had seen punks on the street, but never talked to one before.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at level B1:
People love dolphins. They are very intelligent and can sense human emotions. We often see them in films and TV shows, but the reality is that their situation is very bad. According to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, their numbers are declining.
Dolphins are found in the oceans around the world. There are many different species, including the striped, common, bottlenose, and harbour porpoise. Some dolphins live far out at sea, while others live near European coastlines.
However, many dolphin species are in trouble. The harbour porpoise population in the North Sea has been reduced by up to 89,000. This is because of pollution and overfishing. Dolphins need fish to survive, but if there are too few fish, they may not be able to find enough to eat. They can also get caught in fishing nets and die.
Dolphins can also be harmed by human activities. They can swallow pollution and toxins, which can make them sick. Noise pollution from ships and other human activities can also disturb them.
The situation is serious, and it may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time. We need to take action to protect dolphins and their habitats.

'GETTING FIT Exercise is important for our health and well-being. It's a great way to stay balanced in a busy world. There are many reasons why we should exercise, and few reasons why we shouldn't. Exercise helps us feel better, look better, and stay healthy. It improves our muscle tone, gives us more energy, and helps us sleep better. Exercise can also help with stress and depression. There are many types of exercise we can do, such as aerobics, jogging, and weightlifting. It's important to start slowly and carefully, and to listen to our bodies. Good posture is also important. If we slouch, we can try to imagine a helium balloon pulling our heads up towards the sky. This helps us stand up straight and breathe more easily. Stretching exercises can help us move more easily and prevent injuries. A good exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, a workout, and a cool-down. By following these tips, we can stay fit and healthy.'

'What keeps film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from home for months? They're searching for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, they're always on the lookout for rare animals to film. Right now, they're in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it's been raining for six months. This has caused some problems for them. Owen explained that they had to buy a special vehicle to help get stuck in the mud. He and Amanda have been working together for a long time, making some great wildlife films. They've even made a film about leopards. They're always on the move, filming exotic animals all over the world. I spoke to Owen while he was taking a break at a safari lodge. He said they sometimes argue, but they quickly make up. They both see animals in the same way, which helps them work well together. They set up their tents each night and make tea the night before, so it's ready in the morning. They eat pre-packed meals, which can be a bit tricky to prepare in the wild. It can be tough, but it's worth it to get close to the animals. They've been doing this for a long time, and they've learned to plan for four months of filming to get enough material for a half-hour film. Before they start filming, they have to write a script and get approval. Amanda and Owen work well together because they share the same ideas and vision. They want to make films that show the true spirit of the place and animals, and that touch people's hearts.'

'England's Netball Captain
I met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team, to talk about the World Championships coming up next month. She's been training hard, with a busy schedule of teaching at a local school and training in a car park. I asked her if people give her strange looks, but she said she's too focused on her movements and doesn't notice. Her whole life is now about being at her best for the Championships.
Kendra is playing in her fourth World Championships, and this one will be the biggest ever, with 27 teams taking part. She's excited to have home support behind her, which will make a big difference. She's also aware that there will be more pressure to perform well.
The team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows it will be tough. She said that you have to push yourself every day and can't rest between games. The team's first game is against Barbados, and Kendra thinks it will be an exciting match.
As captain, Kendra's role is to support and encourage her team. She's been playing at the top level for 15 years and has seen the sport become harder and faster. She believes that you don't train to lose, and once the game is over, you become friends again.
Netball is also using new scientific methods to test fitness. Kendra thinks it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. She's been planning her netball career carefully and has decided that this will be her last big event. She'll likely coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on the World Championships.'

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves spending time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which is the study of the chemical processes in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater adventures in a special vehicle. This vehicle is like a small car that takes her down to the ocean floor, where she studies underwater volcanoes.
It's a very small space inside the vehicle, so she can't stand up or move around. She has to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can take 16 hours, including three hours to get to the bottom, 10 hours to collect samples, and three hours to get back up to the surface.
If there's an emergency, Rachel can press a panic button, and a small escape vessel will come out and take her to the surface quickly. But she's never actually had to use it.
Rachel has made six dives so far. Last year, she went on a dive with a Russian team to study a special area of underwater volcanoes near the Canary Islands. She loves her job and is always excited to see the black smokers, which are underwater volcanoes that spew out black smoke.
When she's not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She teaches and does research to learn more about the black smokers. She's been studying them for three years and was amazed when she saw them for the first time.

**First Impressions**
When we meet someone for the first time, we often form an opinion about them quickly. Research shows that people notice how we dress, how we look at them, how we move our bodies, and how we talk. Mary Pearce, a teacher, learned this the hard way. She had a small hole in her jacket during an interview, but she didn't change because she was worried about being late. Unfortunately, the interviewer thought she didn't take care of herself, and that might not be a good quality for a teacher.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, agrees that how we look matters. He says that people who take care of themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. Many people, however, don't think about how they present themselves. Janet Goodwood, an administrative assistant, didn't get an interview for a promotion because she didn't fit the image of an office manager. The director told her to improve her wardrobe before applying again.
Body language also plays a big role in making a good impression. A psychologist found that 55% of what we communicate comes from our facial expressions. Our words and facial expressions should match. If they don't, the interviewer might get confused.
It's also important not to show too much excitement or eagerness for a job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, got a job offer, but she reacted too enthusiastically, which made the boss think she would accept the offer no matter what. Finally, it's a good idea to prepare for an interview by learning about the company and having some questions ready. This will show your interest in the company and help you communicate effectively.

**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
**Darius (Runner)**
I love sports. I played many sports when I was young, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country's youth team and getting a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much attention, so I didn't get any sponsorship. To be a good athlete, you have to be very disciplined. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun, but you have to say no to going out at night before training. My goal is to go to the next Olympics.
**Gabriel (Surfer)**
The surfing community is small, so I see the same people everywhere I compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn. To be good, you have to give up late-night parties. I don't mind, but I do love sleeping in. It's worth it because I won the National Championships last year and got to present a surfing show on TV. I'm a bit famous now.
**Dieter (Yacht Racer)**
With five friends on a boat, we have a great time. We're traditional and celebrate our wins big time. We don't look for media attention, but sometimes the reporters are more interested in where we go out and what we do there than in our sailing results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to go back and do normal things with my friends. I'm known in sailing, but I'm not famous on the street. I reply to all the nice letters I get.
**Tomas (Tennis Player)**
It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd's support. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. I still get a thrill when fans recognize me when I'm out shopping. But it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. We split up because I travel a lot. You have to make sacrifices in any sport. I'm focusing on my game now and will catch up on other things when I retire, which is soon in tennis."

Shopping with children can be very difficult for some mothers. They always want something new and exciting, like a special breakfast cereal or a Disney video. But mothers can't afford to buy everything and feel guilty when they do give in. They also feel bad when they say no, as they don't want their children to be unhappy. Some mothers try to avoid taking their children shopping, but then they worry that they are not teaching them how to make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes while shopping. Many companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. This can make it hard for parents to explain to their children why they can't buy everything they want. Children may not understand why their parents say no, and parents may feel like they are competing with the companies that advertise.
Some parents find it hard to decide what to buy for their children and what to refuse. They may feel stressed and unhappy about it. Some parents talk to their children about the food they eat and the products they buy. This can help children understand why they can't have everything they want. But it's hard for parents to be consistent and say no to their children's requests.
Some people think that supermarkets could make it easier for parents by removing sweets from the checkout area or providing a play area for children. This might make parents happier and more likely to shop there.

'Ice Skating: A Fun and Healthy Activity
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. People used to make skates from animal bones until iron was invented. In Scandinavia, skating was a important skill for the upper class. In the early 1900s, skating was fashionable and elegant. But in the 1920s, a young skater named Sonja Henie showed that skating could be athletic and exciting. Today, skating combines art and sport. It's a fun and healthy activity that anyone can do.
To start, you need to be able to balance and control your movements. Your body position is important. Keep your knees bent and your weight centered. Relaxation is key, so try to stay calm. As you get more comfortable, you can increase your speed and try different movements.
It's also important to know how to fall safely. Even experienced skaters fall sometimes. But by relaxing and using your hands to get up, you can avoid getting hurt.
There are many different styles of skating, such as figure skating, free skating, and speed skating. But to start, it's best to learn the basics of figure skating and then move on to freestyle. With practice, you can master the turns, jumps, and spins.
To improve your skating, you should practice regularly and do exercises to loosen up your body. This will help you move more easily and avoid getting stiff. Skating is a great way to improve your balance, coordination, and overall health.'

'The average height of people in Europe is increasing by one centimetre every decade. This means that more and more people are growing taller. In fact, Chris Greener, a man from Britain, is the tallest person in the country, at 228 cm. He was only 14 when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher thought he was joking because Chris was already very tall at a young age.
Experts say that we are returning to what our ancestors were like 40,000 years ago. They were taller and stronger because they ate a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. But about 9,000 years ago, people started farming and this had a negative effect on their health. They began to eat the same foods every day and became shorter and weaker.
Now, in some countries like the US, Holland, and Japan, people are eating a more varied diet and are getting taller again. In fact, the average height in these countries is increasing. But this trend may not continue forever. Scientists think that there is a limit to how tall people can grow.
Interestingly, while individuals may be growing taller, as a species, humans are actually getting smaller. This is because our ancestors were taller and rounder during the last ice age, when it was cold. Since the climate has warmed up, we have become thinner and smaller. And as the planet continues to warm up, we may shrink even more.'

I don't like places that are completely wild and untouched. I prefer places with human elements, like old temples or villages. When I was a child, I went to school in England and on weekends, I would cycle to a village called Lastingham. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. The landscape was familiar, but different from what I was used to in Scotland. I still visit that place today.
I also like taking the miniature train from Hythe to Dungeness. The train goes through fields and alongside a canal. What I like most is when the train passes through people's backyards. For a few minutes, we get to see people doing everyday things, like making tea or washing dishes. It's the ordinary things that I find interesting.
Matthew likes the Hartland Peninsula, a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and are often empty. He likes to reflect on the sea and take long walks through the valleys. There are also old oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers to see.

You feel excited when it arrives, you see who it's from, and then you enjoy reading what they wrote. I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember. When I was little, I would write notes to my mother. She always wanted me to write thank-you letters for presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home to become a doctor, I would write to my mother once a week. My father would also write, and his letters were always fun to read. Most of the letters were about everyday things happening at home. We would also phone each other, but I remember the letters more. I had penfriends when I was younger. I seemed to attract people who had to be away for work or study, so we would keep in touch by writing. Writing letters actually helped our relationships. I found it easier to express myself in writing than talking. I love getting letters with birthday or Christmas cards. A note is nice, but it's even better to get a year's worth of news! And it's especially nice when the letter comes from a different country with interesting stamps. I get letters from my penfriends in Sri Lanka, Australia, and France. If I hadn't met them in person, I might not have started writing to them. Now we keep in touch regularly. I can even practice my French with one of them. My biggest success with letter writing was when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years, but it was the first time we met. The local newspaper even wrote about our long correspondence. I'm happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I want them to write their own thank-you letters.

Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Some think the whole mountain should be closed to the public, except for guided tours.

The mother feels guilty if she buys it, but if she says no, she feels bad too. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she worries that she's not letting them make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes while shopping. Advertisers spend a lot of money on TV ads, and it's successful. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want. They just see the fun and attractive ads.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that parents are concerned about what their children eat, but they might not always know what's healthy. Parents are frustrated because they're competing with the advertising industry. They feel like they're always saying no to their children.
Some parents find it hard to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother talks to her son about different products and looks at labels with him. She's taught him to be critical of ads. Now, they have fewer arguments at the supermarket.
Parents admit that they're inconsistent and sometimes hypocritical. They might say no to their children's requests, but then buy things they want themselves. Mike, a father, says that he's more likely to say yes to his children's requests when he's feeling generous.
Supermarkets could make shopping easier for parents by moving sweets to a different part of the store or providing play areas for children. This might even attract more customers.

In the winter, they had to find alternative places to climb, like Scotland's snow and ice. As the sport grew, top climbers needed to stay fit. They used brick-edges and stone buildings to keep their fingers strong. This was better than not climbing at all. Many sports centres started building walls for climbing. They used special bricks with edges to hold onto. One teacher, Don Robinson, built a climbing wall at his university in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete. Many walls were built in sports halls in the 1970s. But they had problems. Walls could only be built straight up and down, not like cliffs with overhangs and angled rock. Climbers got bored with the same old holds. In 1985, a Frenchman invented a material that could be shaped like cliff holds. It could be fixed to any wall and taken off when climbers wanted to try something new. French companies also started using steel frames with interchangeable holds. This made it possible to create overhanging walls without big construction work.'

""Want to be an actor? People often think it's a risky career. There are many actors, but not enough jobs. When you tell people you want to be an actor, some friends might think you're crazy. Everyone has different advice. It's a personal choice, and you're responsible for yourself and your dreams.
There's no easy way to become an actor. No exams to pass, no guarantee of success. It's a mix of luck and talent. But there are always new opportunities and the chance for excitement and glamour.
What makes someone a good actor? It's a combination of natural ability and imagination. The most important thing is the actor's courage and confidence. Where does the desire to act come from? It's hard to explain. For actors, the most important thing is the moment they connect with the audience.
Actors don't talk about their chances of getting a job. They prepare themselves for rejection and competition. Nobody likes being rejected. As an actor, you have to be willing to take risks and be available for parts. If you don't care, nobody will.""

Did you know that humans are getting taller? Chris Greener, a man from Britain, is 228 cm tall, making him the tallest person in the country. This is because the average height of people in Europe is increasing by 1 cm every decade. Many people are born taller than before. But this doesn't mean we are becoming a new, super-tall species. Instead, we are going back to how our ancestors were thousands of years ago. 
In the past, people ate a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and animals. They were healthy and strong because of this diet. But about 9,000 years ago, people started farming, and this changed everything. They grew crops like wheat, rice, and maize, which are high in carbohydrates. This diet has had negative effects on our health and bodies. 
For a long time, people didn't eat a balanced diet, and this made them undernourished and underdeveloped. In one study, scientists found that when hunter-gatherers started eating corn, they became sickly and underweight. This was not good for their health. 
However, farming allowed more people to live on the same amount of land, which was good for population growth. But many people still didn't have access to a healthy diet. In recent years, some countries like the US, Europe, and Japan have started eating more like their ancestors, and this has led to an increase in height. 
But there are also problems with this trend. For example, beds and furniture are still the same size as they were 150 years ago, and clothes manufacturers have to constantly update their sizes. The question is, how tall can we get? Some scientists think we might reach 193 cm, but others think we might actually be getting smaller because of global warming.

'Welcome to the Model Village! Just a few years ago, this place was a piece of empty land covered in brambles. One person, with the help of their wife, turned it into the beautiful village you see today. It took a lot of hard work and planning. They moved a lot of soil and clay to create the different levels and shapes you see. They also planted many trees and shrubs, choosing ones that could tolerate the salty air and strong winds. The models in the village were made by one person, Colin Sims, over a period of nine years. He used different materials like stone, wood, and plastic to make them strong and durable. You'll notice that everything is made to a consistent scale and that every detail is important. This took a lot of patience and special skills. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality and maintenance. The techniques used here have been used in other model villages and even in college courses. The buildings in the village are typical of traditional British architecture and are not based on specific real places. As you walk around, you'll see the Manor House, the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models. You can take photos from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. If you press the buttons in front of some of the models, you can make them work. We'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions after your visit. We're always planning new models and want to know what you think. We're always updating and replacing models, so your feedback is important to us. We hope you enjoy your visit and will come back soon!'

""Every week, British newspapers print pictures that invade people's privacy and break their own rules. Celebrities sometimes agree to be photographed by paparazzi, but usually, it's not like that. When famous people are caught on camera in private moments, it can cause a lot of harm. However, very few of them go to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with these issues. Most of the time, these pictures are not in the public interest. Do pictures of famous people help us catch criminals? How did a famous actress's picture on a hotel balcony help keep people safe? She was in a hotel, where people expect to have some privacy, but she didn't complain. The PCC didn't investigate either. This is a big problem. The PCC should look into a recent story about a famous pop star's love life. The star didn't complain either. Shouldn't the PCC take the initiative? It seems like a good idea, but there are many problems. The PCC would have to decide who to investigate, and how to do it. Celebrities might be upset if the PCC didn't investigate a story about them. It's also hard for the PCC to monitor all the newspapers in the UK. Some people might not want an investigation because it would be embarrassing. Others might be worried about what else might be revealed. A comedian was treated unfairly by the press when he was on his honeymoon and again on a family holiday. He didn't complain because he was afraid the newspaper would use the pictures to make a new story. People are scared to challenge the tabloids because they think they will be targeted again. It's hard to find a solution to this big problem.""

When you've had your first job after leaving college, you might be thinking about moving to a second job. This text is not about taking a temporary job while looking for a permanent one, or about leaving a job after just a few weeks. Instead, it's about choosing a job that fits your long-term plans. You should think about what you want to do in the future. Do you want to specialize in a particular field, get more responsible work, or move to a different area? Whatever you choose, make sure it's a good fit for you. You should stay in this job for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job, as it shows that you have thought about your career and are serious about it. The most important things are that the job helps you grow, develops your skills, and gives you more responsibility.
Juliette, for example, worked for three solicitors after college. She liked her job, but there was no chance to move up. So, she left and traveled for a year. Now, she works as a Personal Assistant to a chief executive. In two and a half years, she has become more confident and her job has changed. She used to do simple tasks, but now she does important work like writing letters and managing budgets. Her boss helps her learn and gives her projects to work on.

'Confident People: What's Their Secret?'
Some people seem very confident, but most of them will tell you that it's a skill they learned. Nina Hathway asked five people how they did it.
A Jenny: I used to be very shy when I left school. But when I helped out at my daughter's school, I surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was nervous at first, but my confidence grew as I became more outgoing.
B Michaela: I had to take over my family business when my father got sick. I was scared and became a bit too bossy. But I learned that being confident means believing in yourself. When things get tough, I tell myself that I have nothing to lose. I also remind myself that fear makes us lack confidence.
C Lisa: People think I'm very confident, but actually, I'm often nervous. I've learned to look confident because it's important in my job. Interviewing people has shown me that we all get nervous in important situations. I feel calmer when I talk to someone friendly. My mother once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves.' I remember that and it helps me.
D Barbara: I've built my confidence over the years by enjoying my work and learning from my mistakes. If you just do your best and learn from your mistakes, you'll be more confident next time. I work hard and people like me, but I don't let it affect me. You have to like yourself for who you are, not try to be someone else.
E Kim: I used to be too scared to speak up in meetings, but eventually I started making my point. When I started working in politics, I was nervous about speaking in public. I would tell myself, 'Don't be silly, people do this every day.' I also found it helpful to write down some notes to refer to. I don't think anyone is completely confident when speaking in public. The secret is to tell yourself that anything is possible.'

I visited Malaysia and went to a kite-flying festival. I met Adnan Ali, who gave me a kite he had made. He said I should keep it because it's traditional - if someone finds a broken kite, they keep it. He had many more kites at home, all made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat under some trees and watched the kite festival. Many people had come to fly their kites, and the atmosphere was very lively. Each kite was judged on its decoration, how well it flew, and how stable it was in the air. Adnan invited me to visit him at his home to learn how to make kites. I decided to go, and we drank tea and ate snacks together. The next day, I went to explore the southern part of the state. I drove inland and ended up at a river. A boat took me across, and I saw a sign pointing to a jungle. I decided to go for a walk, but it was a long and difficult climb. I met a man named Baba who offered me tea and showed me to a tented kitchen and some bamboo huts. I stayed there for the night and had a good view of the mountains in the morning. It rained in the afternoon, and I got wet. I was worried about my car being swept away or me drowning. But everything was okay, and I made some new friends in Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan. People were very friendly and asked me lots of questions. I remember my trip to Malaysia for its kite festival and the kind people I met.
