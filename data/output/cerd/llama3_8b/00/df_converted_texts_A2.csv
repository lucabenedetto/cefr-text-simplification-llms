Here is a rewritten version of the passage at the A2 level:

'Paying for trash is a good idea, right? It's good for the environment and the economy. But, it's not that simple. In many countries, people don't pay for taking out the trash. They pay for it through their taxes. But, the cost of taking out the trash is not zero. It costs money to collect and get rid of the trash. If people don't pay for it, they might throw away more trash than they need to.

One way to solve this problem is to make people pay for each bag of trash they throw away. This is called ""pay-as-you-throw."" Some cities have tried this. In one city in the United States, people had to pay 80 cents for each bag of trash. This might seem like a good idea, but it didn't work as well as expected.

People didn't throw away fewer bags of trash. Instead, they just put more trash in each bag. This is not a good way to reduce trash. The weight of trash collected actually went down by only a little bit.

Some people even started throwing their trash away in secret instead of paying for it. This is a problem. The only good thing that happened was that more people started recycling.

The idea of charging people for their trash is not a bad idea, but it's not that simple. We need to think about other things that affect how much trash people throw away, like how much money they have and how much time they have to recycle. We need to use complex models to understand how these things work together.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the text at the level of A2 CEFR:

Many people are unhappy with their work. They feel like they are not respected or appreciated. Just being good at a job is not enough. People want to be happy and fulfilled in their work. This is because work should not just be about making money, but about being a good person.

Some jobs are not as fulfilling as they used to be. For example, doctors are often stressed and unhappy with their work. Accountants are worried about the ethics of their profession. Architects are not able to use their imagination as much as they would like. Managers are often stuck in bureaucracy.

The problem is that people are not happy with their jobs because they are not treated as individuals. They are seen as machines that can be used to make money. This is not good for people's mental and physical health.

Some people are trying to change this. They want to find ways to make work more fulfilling. They want to make sure that people are happy and respected in their jobs.

For example, hotels could be more than just places to sleep. They could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could be given more responsibility and autonomy, and could work together to create a welcoming and respectful environment for guests.

Work should be a relationship between people, not just a way to make money. People should be able to design their own jobs and work with people they like and respect. This would make work more enjoyable and fulfilling.

Good communication is important for this to happen. It's not just about talking, but about really listening to each other and understanding each other's perspectives. This can create a sense of equality and respect between people, and can make the world a better place.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2 on the CEFR:

""BROADCASTING: How Technology Shaped Our Lives

The word 'broadcasting' comes from the idea of spreading seeds widely. It's a metaphor that means spreading something to many people. This idea was used when television was first invented. People thought it would be a way to share information and entertainment with many people at the same time.

Television was a new technology that could send words and pictures to many people at once. It was like a big family gathering where everyone could watch the same thing. This idea of a big, central gathering was popular because it fit with the way people lived and worked in the 20th century.

There were some alternative ideas for how television could work, but they didn't become popular. Some people thought that television could be a two-way communication tool, like a phone or a letter. But in the end, the idea of a centralised broadcasting system won out.

This system was popular because it fit with the way people lived and worked. As people moved to cities and became more connected to the world, they wanted to stay informed and entertained. Television was a way to do that.

The idea of broadcasting is still important today, but it might change in the future. Maybe we'll use different words to describe how we share information and entertainment. For now, broadcasting is a way to spread ideas and stories to many people at once.""<|eot_id|>"

Some people feel that they are never happy, no matter how many things they have. This is because they are trying to buy happiness. Advertisers try to make us feel like we need things we don't really need. They make us feel bad if we don't have something. If we don't buy things, we feel like we are not good enough.

We see many advertisements every day. We see them on TV, on the radio, in newspapers, magazines, and on the internet. They all tell us to buy things. Some people spend a lot of time studying caves. They want to know where they come from and how they work. Caves are interesting and people want to learn more about them.

Weather forecasting is important. Many people used to watch the sky and predict the weather. Now we have special machines that can do this for us. But we still need people to help us understand the weather. They use computers and satellites to get the information. But we still need people to make sense of it all.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a learner of level A2 on the CEFR:

'Music and Theatre

I used to think that opera is mainly a type of theatre. But after working at an opera house, I realized that music is more important. This makes sense. But I come from the world of theatre, where words and actors are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the actors once the show starts, and the actors and audience speak the same language.

When you go to a music concert or opera, some people don't understand the music. They might feel embarrassed or amazed by how good the musicians are. Even if they don't know much about music, they can still appreciate the skill of the performers. It's like watching a sports game - we know athletes work hard to be good, and we admire their skills.

Theatre audiences are different. They don't always understand how actors learn their lines or do their job. They might not be impressed by a long speech. But this doesn't mean they are not generous or demanding. They just have different expectations.

I think music could learn from theatre about how to make the audience feel more involved. Music is already a performance that can be emotional and exciting. But sometimes the way music is presented can feel too formal or hierarchical. This can make the audience feel like they are not part of the performance.

There are people working to make music more accessible and fun for everyone. I want to see more of this. I love both theatre and music, and I think they can both be amazing. I want more people to enjoy them like I do.'

Many people want to feel safe and secure in their homes. This is why we have locks and keys. We like the feeling of turning a key in a lock. Some companies have tried to make electronic locks, but people prefer the old way.

I was worried about visiting the new art museum because I don't understand modern art. I like some of it, like pictures with animals and bright lights. But I don't know what most of it means.

Making Movies into Films

When we make a movie based on a book, we have to change some things. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also be interesting. I worked on a script and I saw that I could take out a lot of the dialogue and description from the book and still get the same message across. This doesn't mean that the original dialogue and description were not important. It's just that the way we tell a story in a book is different from the way we tell it in a movie.

Movies can be very entertaining. We can feel like we are part of the story and forget about our everyday problems. But when the movie is over, we go back to our normal lives. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent watching the movie.

The film studios where movies are made can be confusing. There are many small rooms with the same furniture, and it's hard to find the right one. But people who work there know where everything is, so it's not a problem for them.

Many people want to make movies. They read books about how to do it and take classes at university. Some people even make movies with just a small camera and a low budget. One director, Robert Rodriguez, made a movie for just $7,000 and became famous.

In the past, movie directors had to work for a long time before they could make a big movie. They started by working behind the scenes and making smaller movies. But now, with the help of technology, people can make movies more easily.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a level suitable for A2 learners:

When I was a child, I lived in a place called West Earlham. The houses there were old and not very nice. They were made of orange brick or white stucco. In the summer, a strong smell from a factory came from far away and made the air smell bad. The streets were dirty and the houses were close together.

I remember sitting on a chair near a window and looking at the houses going away into the distance. I also remember my mother ironing clothes in a back room. She was a small, strict woman who was often angry. I never knew why she was angry, so I couldn't make her happy.

My mother was a solitary person who liked to be alone. She was very particular about how we behaved and what we did. For example, she didn't want us to play in our neighbors' gardens or touch their flowers. She also didn't like us to make noise or be late.

As I grew older, I met some of my mother's friends. They were also strict and didn't like to talk much. They would talk about things like the weather and how hard life was. They didn't like children and didn't want to play with us.

When I was young, I used to play at home all day. I would play on a rug in the living room while my mother sat in an armchair. When I was five, I started going to school. I had to walk there with other children from my street. My mother didn't have a bike, so she would send me with other kids.

I remember the summer holidays when we would go on trips to the city. We would see old men who told us stories about their adventures. We also went to a charity fair once where we got lemonade and tried to win prizes. My mother didn't like the idea of charity because she thought people were only doing it to get money.

My mother didn't like politicians and thought they were mean. She thought they were only looking out for themselves. I don't think she was a very nice person, but she tried to teach me things. Sometimes she would take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at paintings. She wasn't very interested, but she liked to pretend to be. One time, she made a joke about a painting of a Roman soldier. I remember it as the only time she tried to be funny.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. It was getting dark and the air was humid and wet. I knew this street from when I was a child. I used to play with my friends who lived in the houses here. The houses looked different now, with new iron railings instead of wooden ones. Some of the old shops had become homes again. I wondered how people lived in these spaces.

I visited a friend who lives in a big, old warehouse. He didn't want a big, open space, so he put up a big piece of plastic to divide the room. He wanted a kitchen in the middle of his flat where he could cook for his friends or work with clients. He also wanted to hide his office and make a hallway.

Bruce Chatwin was a famous writer who loved to travel. He wrote a book about his adventures in Patagonia. His writing was imaginative and exciting. He liked to make things up to make his stories more interesting.

I went for a swim in my pool during a big rainstorm. The rain made the water bubbly and fun. I wanted to swim all the way to the sea, following the rain as it flowed across the country. I wanted to get away from the usual routine and explore the world in a new way.

Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But sometimes it's good to get off the beaten track and do things on our own. Swimming, walking, and cycling are good ways to do this. They help us feel connected to nature and the world around us.

Charles Darwin thought that people cry for no reason. But scientists now think that crying is important for our social relationships. When we cry, we show others that we need help or support.

Sometimes we cry because we are sad or moved by something, like a sad movie or a beautiful song. We might cry more when we are with others than when we are alone. Crying is an important way to show our emotions and connect with others.

The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. We know it's happening, but we're not sure how much warmer it will get or what will happen to our lives. The weather will change, and this will affect the plants, animals, and water. Humans use natural resources like plants, water, and soil to live. We need to be careful with these resources. 

We know that humans have been putting more gases into the air, which makes the Earth warmer. This is making the climate change. But we don't know exactly how much it will change or what will happen. Scientists are trying to predict what will happen. They use computers to do this. 

The predictions say that the Earth will get warmer, and this will cause problems. The weather will be more extreme, like really hot days, floods, and droughts. This will affect where we live, how we grow food, and how we get water. Some places will get more rain, and some will get less. This will be a problem for many people. 

Some good things might happen, like crops growing better in some places. But many bad things will happen too. The sea level will rise, and this will flood many cities and homes. Many people will have to leave their homes and move to other places. This will be very difficult for them.

'Art is a special kind of product that can be difficult to understand because it is often separate from the things that happen in our everyday lives. When we think of art, we often think of paintings, buildings, or statues that are kept in museums or galleries. But art is not just about these objects; it's about how they make us feel and think. 

When we look at art, we often get caught up in the beauty of the object itself and forget about the people and experiences that created it. This can make it hard to understand what the art is really about. 

To understand art better, we need to think about how it connects to our everyday lives. We need to look at the ordinary things that happen around us and see how they are connected to the art. 

For example, we might enjoy a beautiful sunset or a good movie without thinking about the science behind it. But if we want to really understand why we enjoy it, we need to think about the natural world and the people who created the movie. 

Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they might not think of them as ""art"". But these things can be just as important as traditional art forms like painting and music. 

The key to understanding art is to see how it connects to our everyday lives and experiences. When we do this, we can appreciate art in a deeper way and understand what it's really about.'

But, after studying lions for a long time, we have a different idea. We thought that lions would work together to hunt, take care of their babies, and scare away other lions. But, it seems that sometimes working together doesn't help. If one lion is too kind, the others might take advantage of it. So, why do lions still work together?

We thought we would find the answer in a few years, but it took a long time. Lions can live up to 18 years, so it took a while to figure out why they behave in certain ways.

**Advertising in Trouble**

In the early 1990s, advertising agencies faced a difficult time. The economy was not doing well, and many businesses were struggling. This meant that advertising agencies had to work with smaller budgets and make do with less. 

Advertising people felt under a lot of pressure because they were responsible for making sure their clients' businesses were successful. They had to come up with good ideas and make sure they worked well. 

At the same time, many people were questioning whether advertising was really effective. They wanted to know what they got for their money and whether it was worth it. 

This made it hard for advertising agencies to do their job. They had to find ways to make their clients happy with less money.

Fashion is often seen as a modern thing that started in the 19th and 20th centuries. But, actually, fashion has a long history.

Music is a big part of our lives. We can listen to it on the radio, TV, CDs, and the internet. But this has changed the way we experience music. There are fewer live concerts and less work for professional musicians.

In the past, people could listen to music on the radio, TV, records, and tapes. Now, we have many more ways to listen to music. This has made music more accessible, but it has also changed the way we think about music.

To prepare for this change, music teachers will need to adapt. They will need to teach people of all ages and backgrounds how to play different instruments. They will also need to be good communicators and able to work with many different people.

Some people don't like actors. They think actors are pretending to be someone else. But actors know that acting is not just pretending. It's about feeling the emotions and thoughts of the character.

A famous actor named Pavlova said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" This means that some things are better left unspoken.

Another famous actor, Paul Scofield, said that an actor's work is only interesting when they are performing. When they talk about their work, it becomes boring.

There was a play called Hamlet. The actor who played Hamlet, Adrian Lester, was very good. He was like a young man who was trying to become a man. He used his body and voice to show his emotions.

Acting is not just about pretending. It's about finding the feelings and thoughts of the character. It's like finding the right words to say.

A director of a play has a special way of working with actors. They call it ""dropping in"". The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, and then they think about what it means to them. They find the reason to speak, and then they speak.

The perfect theatre is one that makes you feel like you're part of it. The actors and the audience should feel connected. The theatre should be designed in a way that makes you feel like you're close to the action.

Not every play is for everyone. You can't guess what people will like. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and exciting.

Some people write about their lives on the internet. They share photos and stories. But this can be dangerous. We need to be careful what we share. 

A long time ago, a website warned people about sharing their whereabouts online. It said that if you share where you are, you are also telling everyone else. This can be scary. 

Some people have been sharing their lives online for a long time. They are called bloggers. They share their thoughts and feelings with the world. 

One blogger, Justin Hall, started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his life, his feelings, and his photos. He was very open. 

But one day, he had a problem. He fell in love, but his girlfriend didn't like him sharing their life online. She said either he stopped blogging or she would leave him. He stopped blogging. 

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a problem too. She wrote about her job, but her boss didn't like it. Her boss sent her blog to all the important people at work, and she lost her job. 

These stories show us that we need to be careful what we share online. We can't say everything online that we would say in person. Our online life is connected to our real life. If we are not careful, we can make big mistakes. 

Heather Armstrong learned this lesson. She stopped blogging for a while, but then she started again. She wrote about her new family and became a famous blogger. She learned that we can share our lives online, but we need to be smart about it.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the A2 level:

Many people are tired all the time. This is because they don't sleep enough. In the past, people used to sleep a lot more than they do now. They would sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. This was a good time for them to think about their dreams and relax.

Now, people usually sleep for one long time at night. But some people don't sleep well. They might have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. This can be because they are busy or stressed.

Scientists are studying sleep to learn more about it. They want to know why people need sleep and how it helps them. They also want to know how to help people who have trouble sleeping.

One scientist did an experiment. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. The people were happy and felt rested. This shows that sleep is important for our bodies.

There are many things we don't know about sleep. But we do know that women sleep for a little longer than men, and older people sleep less. We also know that people have different sleep patterns in different parts of the world.

In the past, people used to sleep in a different way. They would sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. This was a good time for them to relax and think about their dreams. Now, people usually sleep for one long time at night. But some people don't sleep well. They might have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. This can be because they are busy or stressed.

I wore big, expensive cowboy boots in the desert. I wanted to look like a real cowboy. But I wasn't a cowboy. I felt out of place. I came from Denver and felt like a stranger. I saw a real cowboy at the airport and he didn't even look at me. I used to be a racing driver, but I don't do it anymore. I miss it. I miss the feeling of being fast and being famous. Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked up at the sky and saw some birds. They seemed to be telling me to leave. I realized that the desert has birds that sing. And I realized that I, a fake cowboy, have a lot to learn.

Vancouver is a city in western Canada where many people from around the world live. In the evening, people like to walk around the city and hear different languages being spoken. Many people come to Vancouver because it has a good climate, a beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, and a safe and clean environment. There are also good schools and job opportunities.

Some people may not like how fast new buildings are being built, but the city is becoming more popular and growing. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a place where people would stop on their way to other places. Now, it's still a gateway, but a more popular one.

Journalists are not good at writing letters. They try to make their writing interesting, but this can make it hard to write a natural letter. Real artists don't think about how their words will affect people, and that's what makes their work good. When famous writers like Shakespeare wrote their famous lines, they didn't think about how they would sound, but they still made them great.

In the past, opening a new supermarket was a big event in Britain. Celebrities would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets are opening all the time, so celebrities are not needed. Last week, many people waited to get into a new supermarket. The first five people to enter would get a special prize. This made some people feel happy and others feel left out.

""Citizen Kane is a famous movie from 1941. It was not a big success when it first came out, but it became popular again because of TV. Many people think it's the most inspiring movie that makes people want to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was the first movie made by Orson Welles. Welles said that he was able to make a great movie because he didn't know what was allowed or not allowed, so he just did it. He had a great team working with him.

When Welles and his friend Herman J. Mankiewicz thought about making a movie about a rich newspaper owner who was like William Randolph Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect idea. He could be both the director and the actor. He was very excited.

There is a story about a couple, Dermot and Carmel, who were having breakfast together. Dermot said he might be late and would meet his friend at the golf club. Carmel was a bit worried but smiled and said she would be okay. They talked about what they would do that day.

Now, there is a funny story about job titles. Some people think that job titles can cause problems at work. A survey found that most employers and employees think job titles can make people feel bad or jealous. Some people would even give up a pay rise if they could have a more important-sounding job title. This shows that people are very concerned about how they are seen by others. The truth is that people want to be important and not feel like they are not good enough.""

I went to Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. They are my job and my hobby. I like to capture special moments in time and place. One day, I might take the perfect picture. I will keep looking until I find it.

I was in Vienna because the other photographer, Rudi, didn't want to work there. So, they asked me to do the job instead. I was free and they liked my pictures. I was happy to go. Vienna is a beautiful city. I had been there before, but it was different this time. I was alone and I could take my time to look and take pictures.

The first day, I just walked around and looked at the city. The weather was cold and grey, like the old buildings. I didn't take any pictures that day. I just wanted to get to know the city.

The next morning, I went out early. The snow had fallen overnight and the square in front of the big church was very beautiful. I didn't know how to take a good picture of the church, but I tried. I took a few pictures and then I went back to my hotel to look at them.

Taking pictures is like magic. You can make something special happen. You can take a blank piece of paper and make it into a beautiful picture. It's like a surprise every time. That's why I love taking pictures.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of level A2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

The Hayward Gallery in London is now showing an interesting exhibition about art that moves. This type of art is called kinetic art. The exhibition is special because it doesn't have a lot of text to explain the art. Instead, visitors can look at the art and make their own connections and discoveries.

Some people like art because it is easy to understand. They might like it because it is colorful or because it shows things they know, like people having fun. Others might like the artist, David Hockney, because he is famous and talks well in interviews.

But is it possible that people like Hockney's art because it is popular, not because it is good? Some critics think he is not a very good artist, but Hockney doesn't mind. He knows that people might not understand his art today, but he hopes that in the future, people will see how good it is.

I recently visited many art exhibitions and saw some very good and some not-so-good art. Sometimes exhibitions try to tell us what to think about the art, but I think it's better to let people decide for themselves. That's why I created an exhibition where each artist showed their own work, without any explanations. The art was very different, but it was interesting to see how it all fit together.

Some people think that art should be easy to understand, but others think that it's okay if it's not. Art is a personal thing, and people like different things. It's okay if we don't all like the same art.

Art historians sometimes study art to understand why it was made. They might think that knowing too much about the art takes away from the pleasure of looking at it. But I think it's good to know about the art, because it can make it more enjoyable. We can enjoy art in different ways, and it's okay if we don't all like the same things.<|eot_id|>"

'Metals

A long time ago, people might have started to like metals because they wanted to wear nice things. One day, someone might have found a shiny yellow rock in a river and taken it home. It felt different from other rocks. Maybe this is how people first found gold. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so people liked it a lot. They started to look for more.

Copper might have been found by accident too. When people saw how useful copper tools were, they wanted to find more copper and learn how to get it out of the ground. This is how people started to work with metals.

St Ives

We walked down a narrow, cobblestone street to the center of town. The wind was very strong and the sea was crashing against the wall. There were no people outside and the windows of the houses were closed. We had taken a small train to get to St Ives and the weather was getting worse. We had planned to walk by the sea and have cozy evenings by the fire. But the weather was not good and we were not happy.

Computer Modelling

It's hard to learn about the past because it's already happened. People who lived a long time ago are dead and we can't ask them questions. Archaeologists find clues, but we can't test our ideas. We can't go back in time and see what happened. But maybe we can. We can use computers to make a pretend world and put pretend people in it. We can make rules for them and see how they behave. We can even change the weather or the number of people and see what happens.'

**Vervet Monkeys**

One day, a strong male monkey noticed a strange male in a nearby tree. The stranger wanted to join the group, but the strong male didn't want to lose his position. So, he made a clever plan to keep the stranger away. When the stranger came close, the strong male made a loud noise like a leopard is coming. The stranger ran back to the safety of the trees. This happened many times. But one day, the strong male made a mistake and gave the alarm call while walking across the open ground. 

**Cats**

In a small village, people collected their cats' prey over a year. They found over 1,000 things the cats had caught. A professor thought about this and said that all the cats in Britain must be catching 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats don't catch as much as these village cats. The important question is: are the numbers sustainable? The answer is yes. Many people feed birds in the winter, and birds have places to nest. So, the bird population is high. The survey shows that cats are predators, but they are not destroying the bird population.

**Buffaloes**

Buffaloes are important to marshmen. They sleep on a platform or near the fire with their owners. In the morning, they slowly and tiredly go to the reed beds. They stand on the edge, groaning about the hard day ahead. They eventually go into the water, where they rest and complain. They slowly move away from the house, almost unnoticed. They spend the day grazing in the reeds and bulrushes.

**Picasso's Painting**

Pablo Picasso painted a picture of a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive. The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used many overlapping shapes. The painting looks calm, but there is a sense of danger and violence. The fish and crab seem to be fighting, and the chain around one of the fish looks threatening.<|eot_id|>"

""Photography is a way to capture pictures of the world. It has been around for over 150 years and has changed a lot over time. It helps us see things that are far away, like other planets and different parts of the world. It also shows us what is happening in our daily lives.

People have been making pictures for thousands of years. The earliest pictures were made by drawing on cave walls. These pictures were important for many reasons. They might have been used to show what happened in the past, or to help people remember important events. They might have also been used for magic or as a way to decorate homes.

When photography was invented, it was a big change. It was like having a machine that could take pictures like our eyes do. People thought that photographs were very realistic and accurate. They believed that anyone could understand them, no matter where they came from.

But as time went on, people started to realize that photography is not just about taking pictures. It's also about how we see the world and how we share our thoughts and feelings. Photography can be used to show us things that are important, like big changes in society or big events in history. It can also be used to make us think about the world and our place in it.

In the past, photography was mainly used to record important events. Now, it's used in many different ways. It's used to tell stories, to show us what's happening in the world, and to make us think about important issues. Photography is a powerful tool that can help us see the world in new and different ways.""<|eot_id|>"

**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry is like playing a game. You need to be careful and spontaneous. If you make a mistake, it can ruin everything. So, I will not give you rules. Instead, I will tell you that the most important thing is to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination run free.

Some people need to feel safe before they can write. Others can write when they are sad or upset. Everyone is different. The most important thing is to find your own way to write.

**The Short Story**

When writing a short story, you need to be careful not to have too many characters or too much talking. You should only use flashbacks if they help the story. You can use dialogue to make the story more interesting.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and make a plan. You can't always see what will happen next, but that's okay.

**Language**

Language is a natural part of being human. We all learn to talk without trying. But writing is different. It's not natural for humans to write. We need to learn how to write and understand how it works.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2 CEFR:

I'm not sure if I should start writing this book. It's not like a typical novel because it doesn't have a big story or a happy ending. Instead, it's just my memories of a man I met occasionally. I don't know what happened to him when we weren't together. I could make up some things to fill in the gaps, but I don't want to do that. I just want to tell what I know.

To protect some people's feelings, I've given them fake names. I've also tried to make sure nobody can recognize them. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and maybe he never will be. But maybe his way of living and his kind heart will have a big impact on people after he's gone. Then, people might read my book just because it's interesting.

I don't claim that the conversations I wrote down are exactly what was said. I don't have notes, but I have a good memory for important things. I've written the conversations in my own words, but they're true to what was said. Sometimes, I've added things that I didn't hear, just like historians do. This is to make the story more interesting and believable.

I'm a little worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone unless you're from the same place as them. People are shaped by where they grow up, the food they eat, the games they play, and the books they read. You can't learn all this just by hearing about it; you have to experience it yourself. That's why it's hard to write about people from another country. I've only written about people from my own country before, and even then, I didn't try to make them too real. In this book, I'm trying to show you what I saw, not what the characters saw themselves.<|eot_id|>"

'POETRY RECITALS

Right now, there are many different kinds of poetry being written and read. Some people think it's confusing. In the future, people will look back and see that there were many different kinds of poetry. 

Some poets write for people to read on paper. Others write for people to hear them read out loud. There are many groups that organize poetry readings. These groups are in towns, schools, and colleges. 

Some poets like to read their poems out loud. They write simple poems that people can understand easily. These poets like to perform in front of an audience. 

Other poets are serious about their work. They write complex poems that need to be read slowly. These poets might not be good at performing in front of an audience. 

It's good to hear good poets read their poems out loud. It helps us understand where to put the emphasis. But it's also important to read the poems on paper. We can learn a lot from hearing poets read their poems. 

The main reason for having poetry readings is to make people enjoy poetry. Some people think poetry is only for smart people. But poetry readings can show that poetry is fun and enjoyable for everyone.'<|eot_id|>"

**Oral History**

When historians talk to people who lived in the past, they have to be careful. What people say may not be completely true. The person being interviewed may not remember things correctly, or they may be influenced by what others have told them. Even the historian asking the questions can affect what the person says. The historian's job is to be honest and careful when collecting information.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animals. Some people focus on how animals' bodies work, like how their muscles and nerves work together. Others study animals in their natural habitats and how they behave.

Some scientists who study animals in the lab focus on how animals learn. Others study animals in the wild and how they behave naturally. Both ways are important, and they can help us learn more about animals.

**Social Sciences**

When you start studying social sciences, you need to learn two things at the same time. You need to learn about the subject and how to do research. Social sciences are not just common sense; they have their own special ways of thinking and studying.

**Classical Architecture**

In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was an art that included things like order, proportion, and symmetry. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that architecture should be beautiful and pleasing to the eye.

The history of classical architecture is complex. People built simple houses and huts long before the Greeks and Romans built their famous temples and buildings. These early buildings had their own style and form, which influenced the way the Greeks and Romans built later.

Lily and Chen planned a trip together. They would go early in the morning and come back by lunchtime. Lily would practice driving around the park. Mui, Lily's sister, was not sure about Lily's driving, but she bought a map to help them.

On the day of the trip, they went to the seaside. Lily drove very well. Even Mui was impressed. Chen was happy and even clapped for Lily. They drove past the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats. Lily stopped the car in a quiet street near the sea. She was unsure about the road signs and didn't want to get a fine.

When they got back, Chen joked that the car was old and not worth much. Lily and Mui got upset. Chen said he was sorry and took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held him and said, ""I will teach you to be smart and own many restaurants one day.""

Chen saw a ship on the horizon and took Man Kee to look at it through a telescope. He told Man Kee that it was a special ship that would take them back home when they finished their journey. Man Kee was excited and didn't want to let go of the telescope. When Chen finally got him to give it back, Lily saw only a white circle with scratches. The ship was gone over the horizon, and all that was left was seagulls flying in its wake.

Susan is moving out of her family home. She is sad because she has many memories there. The removal company, ""Removers of Distinction"", is taking everything away. Susan sees that everything that makes the house special is being wrapped in newspaper and packed into boxes. The removal man, Fred, is careful with the breakable things. Susan's children, Robert and Francesca, are helping. They are grown up now, but Susan still misses the time when they were younger.

Susan remembers when they first moved into the house. The piano got stuck on the stairs, and it took a long time to get it inside. Her late husband, Peter, helped resolve the problem. The family had to be patient and find a way to get the piano in.

Now, Susan is leaving the house for the last time. She is worried about the piano, which is very important to her and her family. She thinks about all the memories she made in this house and how hard it is to leave. When the removal men finally take the piano away, Susan's children and the removal man, Fred, laugh and cry together. They are relieved that the move is over.

""The internet has changed the way we share our opinions about books. Before, only a few people could write about books. But now, anyone can share their thoughts on the internet. Amazon, a big online bookshop, made it easy for people to write reviews. Anyone could write a review and give a book 1 to 5 stars.

At first, this was a great idea. People could read what others thought of a book before buying it. But soon, some people started to write fake reviews. They would write good things about their own books or bad things about other people's books. Amazon had to hire people to check the reviews and remove the fake ones.

Some authors even wrote fake reviews themselves. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset about the bad reviews his book got, so he wrote some good reviews to balance them out. But he got caught and had to admit it.

Amazon also let authors write comments about their own books. Some authors wrote nice messages, while others gave their email addresses so readers could contact them. But some people wrote fake comments too. One person pretended to be a famous author, John Updike, and wrote a fake comment.

The real problem was when people wrote mean reviews about books. Some people didn't like a book and wrote bad things about it. Amazon had to remove these reviews.

Despite the problems, many people still like writing reviews. They take it seriously and want to help others make good choices. In the end, the reviews on Amazon are a good way for people to share their opinions and help each other.""<|eot_id|>"

I got some prizes at school and my dad had a long talk with my headteacher. He was quiet for a while and then he said, ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now."" I knew what he was thinking because he was usually a talkative person. ""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""You're going to Oxford because of your good grades,"" he said. ""And you want to be a lawyer."" My dad knows a lot about lawyers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I said. ""I didn't know what else to say!"" My dad said, ""And you have the right personality for it. You're good at talking and you like performing."" ""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I just see it on TV."" My dad said, ""I think you'll never really want to work with us. You'll go to Oxford and then you won't want to do this job."" The problem is that I feel trapped by my family's expectations. I can see there are many jobs I can do, and I want to explore them. But I don't want to upset my dad. ""It's too soon to know,"" I said. ""My dad said, ""You're not going to want to join us, and it's a shame because you have the skills - you're smart, you're brave, and you have a good imagination."" ""What about Maurice?"" I said. My dad snorted. We both knew Maurice doesn't like the business. ""Anyway, you could help me as a consultant,"" I said. My dad said, ""I'll tell you what. You can help us during your holidays until you leave Oxford, and then you can decide if you want to stay or not. It will give you some money and help me."" ""Okay,"" I said. This was the way my dad controlled us. So it happened. I helped out sometimes during holidays and always on easy tasks. I became a smart student and had a nice life with a small house, a good car, and nice clothes. When my dad came to see me before I finished school, he asked me to do one more job for him. It was important for his business. ""But Dad, I have my exams coming up and I need to focus on that,"" I said. My dad didn't understand. He thought I was being selfish. I knew I had to do it.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2 CEFR:

Simon Costello bought a big house in Pembroke Square. He thought it was a mistake soon after he and his wife Lois moved in. The house was very expensive and they had to be very careful with their money. They wanted a bigger place with a garden and a helper for their children. Lois wanted to move because she wanted to live in a nice area. She wanted to be proud of their address.

Lois went back to work at her job after having twins. She got a raise and made more money. Simon's job was going well too. They thought they could afford the big house. But now Simon is unhappy. He has to take a long train ride to work and he's always thinking about his problems. He remembers his childhood and his grandmother's house. She was very kind and made sure his grandfather was happy after a long day.

Lois and Simon have a good marriage. They both work and share the costs. They need both salaries to live well. But now, someone is trying to ruin their life. Her name is Venetia. She is angry and wants to hurt Simon. She asked him some questions about a case he worked on. Simon got upset and said something he shouldn't have. Venetia is very angry and might tell everyone what happened. If she does, Simon's career will be ruined.<|eot_id|>"

I chose to live in this place because I thought I would be alone. But it didn't work out that way. People in the shops know me now. Next door's roses are a reminder that someone used to take care of the garden. I like to stay inside and forget about the summer, but tonight I'm sitting in my small garden. I'm trying to clear some space for a chair and my hands are getting scratched. 

My neighbor, Jaz, is a writer. She's always asking me to help her with her work. I have a copy of her latest book. She comes over and we talk. She's not happy with her job. She says that writers don't have holidays like teachers do. 

I'm going to visit my friend Ruby tomorrow. Jaz is going to ask me to take care of her cats. I don't want to go, but I have to. Jaz is always asking me to help her with her writing. She wants to know what I think of her book. I like the title, but I don't like the story. I tell her that she should write about nice people. She gets upset and says I'm just a teacher. 

I keep a journal and write something good about each day. Jaz thinks that's boring. She says I should get a life. But I do have a life. I work and I go out sometimes. I like to read on the bus.

**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it helps people feel connected to the past. We often feel connected to our own family heritage, but it's also important to learn about our national heritage. This helps us understand our past and our future. Heritage is like a connection to our ancestors, and it makes us feel part of something bigger than ourselves.

**The Fens**

I wrote a book about a place called the Fens in England. It's a special place that is both familiar and strange. The Fens are flat and empty, but also full of history and mystery. I didn't need to visit the Fens to write about them because I used my imagination.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to understand and accessible to everyone. This means using displays that are interesting and interactive. Museums are special because they show us real objects from the past, not just copies or replicas. They help us connect with the past and understand our history.

**Architecture and Environment**

We all want to preserve things, especially when our towns are changing quickly. This makes some people want to keep everything the same, while others think about the future of our towns. It's important for planners to consider our feelings about change and to find ways to make it work.

Albert Einstein is a famous scientist. Many people know his face and think of him when they hear the word ""scientist"". But not many people know what he did. He had some big ideas about the universe and how it works. These ideas are hard to understand, but they changed the way scientists think.

Einstein lived a long time ago, and he was part of a big change in science. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better. They wanted to know how things work together, like matter and energy. Einstein thought about the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. He said that time and space are not fixed, but they are connected.

Some people like to read books, but not everyone likes the same kind of books. Some people like adventure stories, while others like books about science or history. Einstein's ideas were important, and they helped us understand the world better.

Language is a special part of being human. It's how we communicate with each other. But where did language come from? Scientists think it started in East Africa a long time ago. People used language to talk to each other and to show power. They didn't use it just to share information, like we do today.

Writing Reviews

Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews from a reviewer's point of view. Most reviews are written quickly and are only published for a short time. They are usually short and are only in the newspaper for a day or a week. Some people think that reviewing is not a important job because it's not as prestigious as writing a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled job that requires a lot of thought and effort.

A reviewer needs to think about who their audience is and what they want to say. They also need to write clearly and simply so that people can understand what they're saying. A reviewer should know a lot about a lot of things and be able to write in a way that's easy to understand.

Some reviewers, like the American novelist John Updike, enjoy writing reviews and collecting them in books. Others may not be as proud of their reviews and prefer to focus on their main work.

In the English-speaking world, it's common for academics to also write reviews. This is because many academics are also good writers and can write reviews that are helpful to readers. In fact, writing reviews can be a good way for academics to share their knowledge with a wider audience and to make sure that their work is understood by people who may not be experts in their field.

Overall, writing reviews is a important job that requires skill and effort. It's not just about writing a few sentences quickly, but about sharing knowledge and opinions with others.<|eot_id|>"

Ralph opened the door to his flat and felt a little nervous. He had bought the flat three years ago, and sometimes he still felt a little unsure about it. When he first got the flat, he would come home early, excited to see what had happened while he was away. He thought the flat was his own special place, where he could relax and be himself.

But over time, Ralph started to feel like the flat was just a part of him, like an extension of his own thoughts and feelings. He didn't worry about strange noises or mess, but he did feel a little lonely sometimes. He would often come home from work and sit alone, listening to music or reading a book.

Ralph used to think that he wanted to do something important with his life, but he never really knew what that was. He took a job at a local newspaper, just to have something to do. His boss, Neil, was nice and offered him the job right away. Ralph was happy, but he didn't think about what the job would be like in the long run.

Canoe Trip

At night, I was worried because our canoe was wet and we didn't see any villages or houses. We couldn't find a place to sleep. We used a torch to see, but the batteries were weak. We walked for a while and then saw a light in the distance. We thought it might be a village, but it was just the moon shining on the water. We kept walking.

There are some things that can't be rushed. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add mayonnaise to a salad too quickly, it will curdle. The same is true for our minds. Some parts of our brains work fast, while others work slowly. We can learn to do things quickly, like solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But some things need time and patience. 

Our minds have different ways of working. Some parts work very fast, like when we react to danger. Other parts take time to think and figure things out. We need all these different ways of thinking to solve problems and understand the world. 

There are three main ways our minds work. The first is very fast and helps us react quickly. The second is slower and helps us think and solve problems. The third is very slow and helps us think deeply and understand things. 

Sometimes we need to think quickly, like when we're in danger. But sometimes we need to take our time and think slowly. This helps us understand things that are complicated or hard to understand. 

It's good to have all these different ways of thinking. We need to be able to think quickly and slowly to solve problems and understand the world.<|eot_id|>"

Dr. Johnson said that writing is hard work. He believed that if you don't put effort into your writing, people won't enjoy reading it. When I look back at my old school essays, I see that I didn't make many mistakes. This is because it was hard to write with a pen and paper. The slow pace of writing made me think carefully about what I was writing.

Now, with computers, it's easy to write quickly, but this can lead to mistakes. Many people don't take the time to correct their work. Emails are like this too. They can be written quickly and carelessly.

But there's a problem with writing on a computer. The words can look boring and don't have the same feeling as handwritten words. When we write on a computer, we might not think carefully about what we're writing.

In the 1500s, people started to eat breakfast more often. Some people think this is because there was more food available. But others think that other changes in society might have helped.

""Taking Pictures When someone takes a picture, they choose what to show and how to show it. This is based on their skills, what they think is important, and what others think is important. We will see how these things affect what we see in the picture and how we react to it.

For example, when we look at a picture in a newspaper, we might think about if it really shows what it's supposed to show. Or, maybe it shows the photographer's point of view. Is it just one moment in time or is it a symbol for something bigger?

Sports For me, sports is more than just playing a game. The best athletes believe in themselves. They need to focus on their goal and not worry about anything else. Sports can teach us discipline and how to work with others. It's like life - we can do things on our own, but we also need to think about others.

Here is a rewritten version of the text at the A2 level:

Birds have always been important in human culture. We love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? 

In my garden, I hear a strange noise coming from the greenhouse. It's a small brown bird, a wren, bouncing around the glass. Is it trying to tell me something? Or is it just stuck in there?

Wrens have been important in British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in would tell them their luck. Today, we still see wrens in pictures and ceramics in many British homes. The wren is a special bird in our culture and in our hearts. A forest without wrens is a sad place.

People have a special connection with many birds, especially when we live close to nature. We use stories and legends to understand the world around us. This connection is important because it helps us understand our place in the world.

The red kite is a good example. Long ago, people in London loved to see these birds flying overhead, taking bread from children's hands. But soon, people started to see them as pests and they almost disappeared. Now, we are trying to bring them back.

Our relationship with birds is not just cultural. It goes back to when humans first lived on Earth. We have always been fascinated by birds because they can fly and sing. This is a reminder of our own identity and our connection to nature.

Some people might say that our feelings about birds are old-fashioned and not important anymore. But they are still a part of us. That's why birds are important indicators of the health of our environment.

Many birds are in danger, and this is not just a problem for the birds themselves, but also for our culture. The skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are all special birds that carry a lot of meaning. When we lose these birds, we lose a part of our culture and our history.

Folklore is important because it helps us connect with the world around us. The stories we tell about birds are not just about science, but about our feelings and emotions. When we watch birds, we are not just observing them, we are also learning about ourselves.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the rewritten text at a level suitable for A2 learners:

Maps help us understand the relationships between places and things on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people used different ways to measure distance, like 'a day's journey' or 'an hour's walk'. Direction was not as important for most people, who just wanted to know where to go and how far it was. That's why written travel guides were popular for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, don't show directions clearly.

In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked with signs. These signs were different sizes to show how important they were. The way maps were made changed over time. Cartographers (map makers) used new ideas and tools to make maps more accurate and detailed. They used science to help them, like the magnetic compass to find direction.

As people explored the world, they discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere. This changed how maps were made. The people who used maps also changed. Travelers, merchants, soldiers, and scientists all needed maps for different reasons. Cartographers had to make maps that worked for everyone.

Today, cartographers make maps for many different purposes. They show things like where people live, what the climate is like, and where different types of rocks are found. This is because maps are important for many sciences. Cartographers have to use new ideas and tools to make better maps. Sometimes, old ideas stay around for a while before new ones come along. Maps are important because they show us how people thought and lived in the past. Studying old maps is fascinating and helps us learn about history.

But I can't think of many TV shows that show both how beautiful and complicated art is. A good example of what goes wrong is Robert Hughes's TV series about American art. Hughes is a good critic who is easy to listen to, and he had a lot of time to tell British people about a type of art that British museums don't show. I thought the series would be about famous artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

There are many books like this that help people feel better about themselves. Some people write books about their own lives. But sometimes they might not tell the truth. They might leave out important things or make things up.

There is also a type of book called a detective story. These books are like puzzles. They are about a detective who solves a mystery. One famous writer of detective stories is Dashiell Hammett. He wrote about a detective who was not always good or bad. He was a bit of both.

Some people write about science. One good writer about science is Stephen Jay Gould. He says that to write about science, you need to understand the science and the culture around it. You should not write down to the reader, but use simple language and make the argument clear.

'Air-conditioning at the Gym

The gym in the City of London is very cold. It's because of the air-conditioning. It's so cold that it feels like being in the Arctic. This is an example of how people misuse air-conditioning. They use it too much. We can use other ways to cool down, like opening windows or using thicker walls that keep the heat out.

Sundials

People are interested in sundials again. They are old instruments that show the time based on the sun's position. A long time ago, people used them to know what time it was. Now, people are using them again because they like the connection to the planets. They are calm and romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

Painting China

I saw some women painting china cups at an exhibition. They were very good at it. I thought it would be hard to learn, but when I took a class, it was fun. The students were all there to have fun, not to be perfect. We didn't have to paint like the women I saw before. We could make our own designs and have fun doing it.'

I changed the text by:

* Simplifying vocabulary: I used simpler words and phrases, such as ""cold"" instead of ""chill"", ""misuse"" instead of ""misuses"", and ""thicker walls"" instead of ""walls that absorb less heat"".
* Shortening sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to understand.
* Removing complex ideas: I removed ideas that were too abstract or complicated for a learner of level A2, such as the concept of ""the ability of humanity to control the climate"".
* Adding simple examples: I added simple examples to help illustrate the points being made, such as the idea that we can use other ways to cool down besides air-conditioning.<|eot_id|>"

Keith and Dawne went on a holiday package to Venice, Italy. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel in Switzerland instead of Venice. They gave their tickets to a girl at the airport and trusted her to take them to the right place. But she put them on the wrong plane. 

When they got to the hotel, they met a woman named Mrs. Franks. She said they were in the wrong hotel and that they were with a group of older people on a different holiday. Keith and Dawne were very confused. They wanted to go to Venice, but Mrs. Franks said it was too late to change their plans.

Keith and Dawne were very upset. They didn't want to be on a holiday with older people. They wanted to be in Venice, but it was too late. They had to accept their situation and enjoy their holiday in Switzerland.

Note: I simplified the text by removing complex vocabulary, sentence structures, and ideas. I also removed some details that were not essential to the story. The text now has a more basic vocabulary and sentence structure, making it more suitable for a learner of level A2 on the CEFR.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a level suitable for A2 learners of English:

Many American business leaders are looking at Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer, as an example of good management. Shackleton was a British explorer who went on many adventures to the Antarctic. He is now being studied by American business leaders because they think he can teach them how to be good leaders.

Shackleton was a very good leader. He was brave, clever, and kind. He took care of his team and made sure they were all safe. When things went wrong, he stayed calm and thought carefully about what to do. He was also very good at communicating with his team and making sure they knew what was happening.

Some business leaders think Shackleton's way of leading is very useful for them. They think he shows that even in difficult times, you can still be a good leader if you stay calm, think carefully, and take care of your team. Shackleton's story is also very inspiring. He was a true hero who never gave up, even when things seemed impossible.

Shackleton's story is being told in many different ways. There are books, films, and exhibitions about him. Some business leaders are even using his story to teach their employees how to be better leaders. They think Shackleton's way of leading can help them make better decisions and work better together.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2 on the CEFR:

'There is a special animal called the aye-aye in the forests of Madagascar. It eats insects that live inside wood. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker because it uses its teeth to chew into the wood and its long finger to find its food. 

Scientists have been studying the aye-aye to see how it finds its food. They gave it logs with holes in them. Some holes had insects inside and some were empty. The aye-aye could find the insects without looking at the holes. It didn't use its sense of smell or hearing either. 

The scientists think that the aye-aye uses its sense of touch to find the insects. It taps the wood with its finger and listens for the sound of the echo. It can also hear the insects moving around. 

The aye-aye is special because it can do things that other animals can't. It can be like a woodpecker and a bat at the same time. It also eats nuts like a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing like a squirrel's teeth do. 

In the wild, the aye-aye has been seen eating nuts and taking out the inside with its long finger.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for a learner of English at the A2 level:

Most people have photos of their grandparents, but few know what their lives were like when they were young. We often forget important things about our family history. Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes books about ordinary people's lives. She talks to them, records their stories, and writes a book about their life. The book is like a diary, but with pictures and words. It's not about famous people, but about regular people like you and me.

Hannah started doing this because she realized that her own family's past was disappearing. She talks to people and writes down their stories. She wants to help people remember their past and understand themselves better. She also helps people to share their stories with their families.

The people she writes about are happy to share their stories, but they are also honest about their mistakes and struggles. They talk about things that hurt them, like a difficult divorce. They also talk about patterns in their lives that they repeated because of things that happened when they were young.

Hannah's books are not for the public. They are for the person's family, so they can learn about their ancestors. The books are expensive, but Hannah thinks it's worth it. She wants to help people understand themselves and their families better.

A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology

This museum has a big collection of copies of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over 600 pieces. All the sculptures are copies made from the originals in the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum is in a special building with good natural light. The best thing about the copies is that we can see groups of sculptures together, even if they are now in different museums in Europe.

B. Cambridge Darkroom

This is a place for photography. We have a darkroom and a gallery with different exhibitions. We also offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skills. We have a membership scheme and sell photography books and materials.

C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology

This museum has a big collection of fossils, rocks, and minerals from all over the world. It also has a special collection of fossils from a long time ago, kept in old cabinets. The museum is arranged by time, so we can see how life on Earth changed over time. We also have a special room with beautiful minerals and gems.

D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs

This collection has over 400,000 photographs taken from airplanes. The university has its own plane and takes pictures of the landscape all over Britain. The photos show how the land has changed over time. We have a small display and the staff can help you with questions. You can buy copies of the photos, but you can't borrow the originals.

E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre

This is a special place where you can make copies of old brass plates from medieval tombs. You can make wall hangings by rubbing the plates. The centre has made copies of the original plates so we can preserve them. The brass plates were a way to remember important people in the past. Most of the original plates were destroyed, but we have many left in Britain and can see them here.

I am a father of three children. I have been very lucky to have them. We all love the same things, like opera and music. This makes us close. I'm not perfect, but I try to be there for them when they need me.

I was young when my children were born. It was hard to take care of them, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they introduced me to new things, like music and fashion. This helped me with my job.

I'm a politician, so I have to work a lot. But I make sure my children can come with me sometimes. This way, they know what I do and don't feel left out.

I've been a single father for a while, so I had to learn to take care of my children on my own. I tried my best, but I think I could have done some things differently. I still worry about my children a lot.

I have a daughter, and she has made me realize what's important in life. Being a parent is a big responsibility, but it's also very special. Sometimes it's hard, but looking at my daughter's smile makes everything okay.

I had a special time in my life when I didn't have a summer for nine years. I would go to New Zealand every winter and stay there for three months. My parents bought a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. They said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" We wanted to have a special connection to New Zealand because my father grew up there.

I liked the idea of planting trees. I had worked on farms in Australia before and enjoyed it. My family was also excited about the project. We planted 70 acres of land in 1968. It was a difficult time because it rained a lot, but we were happy to be planting trees.

It was hard work, but I enjoyed it. We had to get used to planting trees every day. It was like a routine. We would plant a lot of trees at once and then take a break. I had a friend who knew how to plant trees, which was helpful. We had to make sure the trees were planted in a straight line. It was hard to do, but we got better at it.

I like physical work, and planting trees made me strong. After a while, I could plant trees easily. I would think about my life and the world while I was working. I started to think about how we can take care of the earth.

I went back to New Zealand a few times to see the trees grow. It was nice to see how they were doing. Sometimes, I would read about bad weather in New Zealand in the news and feel worried. But the trees are doing well now.

I took a break from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months in 1984. I wrote my first book there. I would write in the morning, work on the trees in the afternoon, and do research in the evening. I feel very connected to that place and the earth. It's a special bond.<|eot_id|>"

We have a farm in Somerset, England. My husband and I turned it into an 'open farm' six years ago. We take care of orphaned animals. One day, some workers brought us three baby badgers. They were very small and cold. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow. We took care of them and fed them milk from a bottle. We also had to clean them to get rid of fleas.

At first, we had to feed them every four hours. But after a week, they started drinking from a bottle on their own. They were very happy and playful. We would take them on walks at night, and they would chase each other and play.

But one of the cubs, Willow, got sick and died. We were very sad. Later, we found another baby badger, Willow II, and took care of him too.

As the cubs grew, we started giving them solid food, like cereals and fruits. They loved it! They would eat and play all day. We would take them on walks at night, and they would chase each other and play some more.

One day, we built a special home for the badgers. It had tunnels and a big enclosure. They loved it! They would play and explore all day. We would visit them at night, and they would come to say hello.

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous scientist who lived a long time ago. Halley is best known for discovering a comet, but he also did important work on the compass. He wanted to know how the compass worked on ships at sea. This is important because sailors needed to know where they were going.

Halley went on two big trips to the sea to study the compass. He sailed to many places, including the Cape Verde Islands and Rio de Janeiro. He even went to the South Atlantic and the North Atlantic. He wrote a book about his findings, which helped sailors for a long time.

Now, Dr. Clark wants to follow in Halley's footsteps. He wants to sail the same route and make new measurements. This will help us understand the Earth's magnetic field better. The Earth's magnetic field is changing slowly, so we need to update our knowledge.

Every summer, peacocks in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for a long time. How did these birds evolve such a fancy feature? It's not easy to understand why they didn't just develop something more practical. 

A scientist named Marion Petrie and her team are trying to solve this mystery. They are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade because they live in a special place where they are free to roam, but are still used to people. The team wants to know two things: do the hens really choose the peacocks with the most beautiful tails? And do these peacocks have some special quality that helps them survive, or is it just for show?

The team has been watching the peacocks and taking pictures. They found that the hens do like the peacocks with the most eye-spots on their tails. But they still don't know if these peacocks are also healthier or stronger than the others.

One scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that showy birds are often healthier because they don't get sick as easily. But the team at Whipsnade can't check this for the peacocks. They are going to study the babies of the peacocks and see if they grow faster or are healthier if their dads have beautiful tails.

There is another idea called ""Fisher's Runaway"" that might explain how the peacocks got their tails. It's like a cycle: a hen picks a peacock with a slightly better tail, and then their babies inherit the tail and also like long tails. This cycle makes the peacocks' tails get longer and longer over time. This idea might prove that the hens are choosing ""beauty for beauty's sake"".<|eot_id|>"

My boat is simple and traditional, but it has modern technology too. Some people might think it's old-fashioned, but I think it's perfect.

I used to have another boat, ""Hirta"", which was very old-fashioned. It didn't have all the modern comforts, but it was a great boat to sail. I learned a lot from sailing it.

When I got hurt, I had to sell ""Hirta"". I looked for a new boat, but couldn't find one that was right. So, I decided to build a new one from scratch. The designer, Nigel, drew the plans on a napkin and then used a computer to make changes. We tested the design and made it better and better until it was perfect.

My new boat, ""The Westerman"", is very special. It's been on the North Atlantic and has won some races. It looks old-fashioned, but it's actually very modern. The wood is treated with special glue, so it's waterproof. It's like a glass fibre boat, but it looks and feels like a real wooden boat.

'Natural Talents

Humans and animals are very similar. In fact, we are almost the same as chimpanzees. This means that what makes us different from animals must be a recent development. Our bodies and brains are not very different from those of animals. So, what makes us human? 

Some people think that our art is what makes us different. But, animals also make art. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and to protect themselves. They even make simple paintings. So, what is the difference between human art and animal art? 

Some people say that human art is not useful. It is not like the art that animals make to help them survive. Human art is made for pleasure. This is true, but animals might also make art for pleasure. We can't ask animals if they enjoy their art, but we can see that they make it.

Another difference is that humans learn to make art. We learn from each other and from our parents. Animals, on the other hand, are born with the ability to make their art. For example, some birds are born with the ability to sing a certain song. 

But, there is a problem. Some animals, like chimpanzees, can also learn to make art. They can make paintings and drawings. And, some of their paintings are even sold! This makes us question what makes human art different. 

In the end, the differences between human art and animal art are not as big as we thought. Both humans and animals make art for pleasure, and both learn to make it. The only difference might be that humans make more complex art and learn to make it in different ways.'<|eot_id|>"

Charles' workshop is under a railway arch in London. It's a big space with lots of half-made furniture and wood. He is always working hard because he doesn't have time to waste. He is proud of his work and wants to make sure everything is perfect.

Charles is not like other furniture makers. He doesn't make cheap, mass-produced furniture. He wants to make things that people will use for a long time. He is not happy when he sees bad furniture and people buying it.

Charles is very good at what he does. He is proud of his skills and thinks he has a natural talent. He learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his customers are individuals, not companies. He likes working with people who know what they want.

Charles is a good person to work with. He is honest and says what he thinks. He likes working with clients who are exacting, meaning they know what they want and are specific about it. He also likes praising others when they do a good job.

However, Charles is not happy with some furniture makers who try to be artists and take a long time to make one piece. He also doesn't like degree shows where students show off their work, but also try to make a statement. He thinks furniture should be functional and useful, not just a decoration.

At the end, Charles says that he is just making furniture, which shows that he is humble and down-to-earth.<|eot_id|>"

'Why do we sleep? People sleep for about one-third of their lives. It's clear that sleep is important, but we don't know exactly why. Scientists have three ideas about why we sleep. The most popular idea is that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. While we sleep, our bodies fix any problems that happened during the day and make us strong again. Another idea is that sleep helps us learn. It helps us remember things we learned during the day. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to learn new things. The third idea is that sleep gives us energy. We need to sleep to recharge our bodies so we have enough energy for the next day.'

I changed the following to make it simpler:

* Shortened sentences and phrases
* Used simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""important"" instead of ""vital function"")
* Removed complex phrases and sentences
* Used more concrete examples (e.g. ""fix any problems"" instead of ""repair any damage done during the day"")

Here is a simplified version of the text for a learner of English at level A2:

Some people are called eccentrics because they don't follow the usual rules. But what is normal? We all have things that make us different. Maybe you like to collect stamps or play a weird sport. Being eccentric means being yourself and not caring what others think.

Most of us want to fit in and be liked by others. We also want to be different and stand out. This can be a problem because we often feel like we have to choose between being ourselves and being like everyone else. Some people join groups or clubs to be with others who like the same things. This makes them feel better.

We all have a mix of wanting to be the same as others and wanting to be different. We might pretend to be like everyone else, but deep down we want to be ourselves. Some people are famous because they are different and don't care what others think. But being eccentric is not just about being different, it's about being natural and not trying to be different just to get attention.

Note: I simplified the text by:

* Using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary
* Removing complex ideas and abstract concepts
* Focusing on the main ideas and leaving out less important details

We asked four famous nature experts to tell us about a book that has had a big influence on them. 

One expert, Geoffrey Lean, chose a book by a woman named Barbara Ward. She was very important in the field of environmental protection. The book he chose is called ""The Home of Man"". It's about how cities are growing and how we need to take care of the Earth.

Another expert, Linda Bennett, chose a book called ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen. This book is about how animals communicate with each other. It's very interesting and has beautiful pictures.

Lee Durrell chose a book called ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book is about his family and their adventures with animals. It made him love nature even more.

Bruce Pearson chose a book called ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher. This book has beautiful pictures of birds and information about them. It helped him learn more about birds and nature.

Do book reviews help sell books? We asked five big book publishers in the UK about this. Here's what they said.

Publisher A Reviews are very important for us. People often buy books because of good reviews. In fact, a study found that people buy books because of reviews more often than because of ads or word of mouth.

Publisher B Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to sell books. Book reviews are better now than they used to be, but some books are still not reviewed. This is a problem, especially for paperback books.

Publisher C Reviews are very important for us. Without them, we wouldn't be able to tell people about our books. Good reviews can help sell books, especially if they come from well-known writers or critics.

Publisher D The relationship between publishers and reviewers in the UK is complicated. In the US, one review in a big newspaper can make or break a book. But in the UK, people in bookstores don't always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes, books that get bad reviews are actually very popular.

Publisher E Publishers and writers want to get good reviews, but do they really help sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell well. Some people thought they didn't need to buy the book because they had already read the reviews.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level A2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

Nicholas Evans is a British writer who wrote a very successful book called The Horse Whisperer. Before it was even published, people were very excited about it. The book is about a special kind of person who can calm down horses. The writer, Nicholas, was inspired by a man he met who told him about a horse that became very calm after talking to a gypsy.

Nicholas was having a tough time when he started writing the book. He had been working on a film project that didn't work out, and he was worried about money. He decided to take a break and travel to America to research his book. He spent three months driving around, learning about horses and the people who work with them.

When he got back home, he wrote the first half of the book. He was worried about how he would pay his bills, but then his friend, a literary agent, read the book and thought it was good. He said Nicholas might get $30,000 for the book. Nicholas was happy because that was more than he needed to pay his debts.

Then, Nicholas's agent sent the book to some publishers. One of them offered $75,000, but his agent thought something bigger was coming. And it did! The book was sold to two big publishers for a record-breaking amount of money. Nicholas was very happy and surprised.

The book became a huge success, and soon film companies were interested in making a movie based on the book. Nicholas was offered a lot of money to write the screenplay, but he decided not to do it. He wanted to write another book instead.<|eot_id|>"

Bobby Fischer, a famous chess player, is playing again after 20 years. He is 49 years old and not as good as he used to be. He is playing against his old friend Boris Spassky, who is also old. Chess has changed a lot since Bobby Fischer last played. Now, chess players are more professional and the game is more competitive. The goal is to win, not just to play well. Players need to be good at thinking quickly and making decisions fast. The game is also longer now, and players can't take breaks.

Young players are doing very well in chess. The world's top 10 players are all under 30 years old. This is because they are better prepared and have better equipment. They use computers to study chess and find new strategies. Chess players need to be strong physically and mentally. A game can last up to 8 hours, and players need to stay focused. If they make a mistake, they can lose the game.

Bobby Fischer wants to prove he is still the best player in the world. He will play against Boris Spassky and win some money. But it's not just about the money; it's about winning and being the best.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a learner of level A2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

Some people think that volunteering abroad is not very helpful for the local communities. They pay a lot of money to help, but if they gave that money directly, it could help more people. This is especially true for young people who are on a gap year and don't have special skills. Some people think that they are really helping, but maybe they are just doing it to look good on their resume.

Volunteering can be good for many things. It can help people understand each other better, solve problems, and work together. It can also help people from different countries meet and learn from each other. However, if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, it won't help the people who need it most.

Volunteering can be good or bad. It can be a way for rich people to feel good about themselves, or it can be a way to really help people. It can also be a way to learn new skills and make a difference. But sometimes, volunteering is just a way to make money or look good, and it doesn't really help anyone.

Some people think that volunteering is a good way to help others. They like that it's not controlled by big governments or companies. But others think that it's not enough. They think that we should work together to make big changes, not just small acts of charity.<|eot_id|>"

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up. But it's hard to get out of bed. That's why we have alarm clocks. We tested five different alarm clocks to find the best one. One alarm clock had a special feature called a ""dual alarm"". This means you can set two different times for waking up. But this feature didn't work well. The instruction book said you could use it to set different times for work and weekends, but that's not very useful.

One alarm clock had a cassette player. This means you can listen to your favorite music or a soothing tape to help you sleep. The radio quality was very good, but the clock was too big.

We all liked the design of another alarm clock. It had a digital display with nice numbers and a soft green background. The snooze button was easy to find and use. The clock also had a special feature that kept working even if the power went out.

However, some people found it hard to set up this alarm clock. The instruction book was long and complicated. One person thought the clock was too big and ugly. Another person liked the idea of a built-in lamp, but it was hard to position and didn't work well.

We also tested a simple and cheap alarm clock. It was easy to set up and took up little space. The tuning was a bit old-fashioned, but the radio quality was good. The buzzer worked well and woke us up quickly.

Overall, we found that the best alarm clock was the one with the digital display and the built-in lamp. It was easy to use and had good quality radio.<|eot_id|>"

Jill, a 27-year-old skier, says it's a great feeling to ski fast and land safely. But it can be scary sometimes. She has to train for 10 months a year, which means she can't have a normal life. She has to make sacrifices, but it was her choice.

Caroline, a 22-year-old cyclist, started cycling by accident. She borrowed a bike and won a race! Now she's a professional and earns a good salary. But she worries that people might think she's successful because of how she looks, not because she's a good cyclist.

Annabel, a 26-year-old rower, says it's hard for girls to get into rowing because few schools offer it. She started rowing late, so it's harder for her to be as good as the men. But she loves being fit and has a good social life.

Ffyona, a 24-year-old long-distance walker, has always loved walking. She walked across Australia and broke a record! She had to walk 50 miles a day with blisters on her feet. She says men think women are more likely to fail, so it's harder for them to get sponsors.

Lisa, a 26-year-old saloon car racer, says some men are mean to her because she's a woman. She has to be very competitive and aggressive to win. It's hard to earn money in her sport, but she loves it.

One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant. He was an old man, but I knew who he was. I was surprised because he was usually a private person.

I was with a friend, and he encouraged me to go talk to Picasso. I was shy, but my friend pushed me to do it. I showed Picasso my sketchbook and asked him to sign it. He agreed, and then he added a drawing on the page. It was a beautiful drawing, and I was happy.

After that, my friend suggested that I draw Picasso's portrait. I was nervous, but Picasso seemed to enjoy it. He acted out different faces and made me laugh. I tried to draw him, but it was hard. He was a good model, and he made me want to give up. But he finally stopped acting silly and let me draw him normally. I was surprised at how young he looked, even though he was 84 years old.

When I finished drawing, Picasso looked at it and nodded. He said it was good, and then he drew a portrait of me. It was very different from my drawing, but it was also very good.

**How shops try to get you to buy more**

Do you ever go to a shop and buy more things than you planned to? Shops use special tricks to make you spend more money. Let's see some of these tricks.

**Fresh and clean**

Shops make sure their fruit and vegetables are fresh and look nice. They put them near the entrance so you see them first. They also make the store smell nice, like freshly baked bread. This makes you feel like you're buying something healthy and fresh.

**Where things are placed**

Shops put important products in easy-to-reach places. They put things that are popular and make a lot of money near the front of the store. They also put things that are not as popular, but sell quickly, in easy-to-reach places.

**Making you walk around**

Shops put cheap things, like bread and sugar, in different parts of the store. This makes you walk past other things you might want to buy. Some shops even put their own brand products far from the entrance, so you have to look for them.

**Making things look good**

Some shops make their products look expensive and exclusive. They put limited amounts of things on the shelves, so you feel like you're getting something special.

**The price of things**

Shops put different prices on things to make you buy more. They might put cheap things next to expensive things, so you buy more of the cheap things. They might also put things on sale to make you buy them.

**Lighting and decorations**

Shops use lighting and decorations to make you feel good and want to buy things. They might use bright lights to make things look nice and appetizing.

**Guiding you through the store**

Shops use different carpets and patterns to guide you through the store. This makes you follow a certain path and look at things they want you to see.

**Advertising**

Some shops use big pictures and videos to make you want to buy things. They might even use special screens on trolleys to show you ads while you shop.

These are just a few tricks that shops use to make you buy more. Next time you go shopping, see if you can spot some of these tricks!<|eot_id|>"

Apples have been around for a long time. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. But we might lose some of these varieties. 

A long, long time ago, people ate apples. They even planted apple seeds in Britain. In Switzerland and Italy, people stored apple halves for the winter. These apples were not like the apples we know today. 

The Romans taught the French how to grow apples. They brought apples to Britain. The monks in Britain experimented and grew new apples. These apples are the ones we have today. 

In the past, people in Britain grew many types of apples. One type was called Pearmain. It was sweet and tasty. Another type was called Costard. It was used for cooking. 

In the 16th century, a king named Henry VIII wanted to learn about growing apples. He sent a man to France to learn. The man brought back special apple trees. 

People took apples with them when they traveled to new countries. They planted them and grew new trees. 

In the 19th century, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees in America. He was very kind to animals and people. 

In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer found a new type of apple. It was called Delicious. It became very popular.

Advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic crisis. Advertising has been declining since 1989, even before the crisis started. The problem is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers like to think about big groups of people and big media, but as there are more brands and media, the groups of people are smaller. Even big brands don't usually target the right people. This is the main reason why advertising is not working well.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30-50 things. Most of these things are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. Over a year, you probably buy less than 400 different brands. This is different from the 32,500 brands that are advertised.

Most people don't buy many of the advertised brands. When you watch TV, you might see 1-2 commercials for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, this is about 6%. The other 94% of commercials are wasted.

You might think you are special and don't get influenced by advertising, but you are not alone. Most people think the same. The truth is that most people don't buy most of the advertised brands. Advertising has to reach many people to find the right ones, but it's hard to know who will respond.

Even with smart targeting, advertisers can't know exactly who will respond. They can try to reduce waste by targeting the right people, but they can't know for sure. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesman can know who will buy.

If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need to use media advertising. They could just talk to those people directly. Any advertiser who can get 1-2% of the population to buy their product is doing well. The most effective way to reach those people might be through mass media, but to make advertising work again, advertisers need to target their message better than ever before.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2:

Blacksmiths have always been important people. They make things from iron, like tools and weapons. Long ago, blacksmiths were as important as doctors and scientists. They made beautiful and strong things like gates, bridges, and buildings.

In the past, blacksmiths were very skilled and creative. They made beautiful things like the ironwork in St Paul's Cathedral. But, many years ago, blacksmiths became less important because machines replaced them. Architects stopped using iron for decorations.

Recently, people have started to appreciate blacksmiths again. They like the way iron can be shaped and decorated. There is a group called the British Artist Blacksmiths Association that shows off the work of blacksmiths. They have an exhibition where you can see many beautiful things made from iron.

One of the blacksmiths, Alan Dawson, says that iron is a great material to work with. He can make many different things, like gates, lamps, and even a spiral staircase. He likes to shape the iron when it is hot, like drawing with metal.

Another blacksmith, Susan May, says that iron is special because it is soft when it is hot, but hard when it is cold. She likes to make things like door-knockers and handles that look like they are from a castle.

The article says that iron is a great material that can be used for a long time. It can be used to make beautiful and strong things that people will like for a long time.<|eot_id|>"

I stopped smoking recently. I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my friends was very upset. ""Why didn't you stop earlier?"" she asked. I couldn't explain why I suddenly stopped smoking. I went to a stop-smoking group to write an article about other people who quit. I said, ""I'm not going to try to stop. I'm just here to write about it."" The group leader looked at me strangely. We were allowed to smoke during the session, and the room was very smoky. But when it was time to smoke, I didn't want to. I think it was because I started to think about the reasons why I should stop smoking. It was like a challenge. I felt powerful when I thought about not smoking. It was a secret feeling that only I knew. It was easy to stop smoking. I didn't feel like I needed cigarettes anymore. I thought it would be hard to work without cigarettes, but it wasn't a problem. The only hard part was doing nothing on weekends. I miss cigarettes a little bit, but not too much. Now I have to think about new things, like eating out or waiting for a plane.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the text, simplified for a learner of level A2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

There is a British scientist named Dorothy Hodgkin who won a very important award called the Nobel Prize. But many people in the UK don't know about her. I think she should be famous in her own country. I've been asking my friends about her, and most of them haven't heard of her. This is strange, because if a writer or artist won a Nobel Prize, everyone would know their name.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a very special person. She was a woman and a scientist, which was unusual in her time. She worked on very important projects, like finding the structure of penicillin and insulin. She was very good at her job and won many awards. But she also had a personal life. She was married and had three children. Her life was not just about science, but about balancing her work and family.

Some people think that scientists are boring and don't have interesting lives. But this is not true. Scientists are people too, with their own stories and struggles. We can learn from their experiences and passions. It's sad that many people don't know about Dorothy Hodgkin or other scientists like her. We should learn more about them and appreciate their contributions to science.

Margaret Wilkins is a woman who can find water with a special stick. She has a special feeling that helps her know where water is underground. Many farmers come to her when their wells dry up. She works with her husband to find water. They use machines to drill for water, but Margaret uses her special stick to find the right place to drill.

The stick is forked and she holds it in her hands. When she is above water, she feels a strange feeling and the stick moves. She uses this to find the exact spot to drill. Her husband also uses the stick, and they usually agree on where to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they do.

Many people are interested in how Margaret does this. Some think it's because everything on Earth vibrates, and she can feel these vibrations. Others think it's because she has a special sense that helps her find water.

Margaret's business is very successful. She has a long waiting list and many customers come to her because their wells are dry. She tries to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and safe to drink.

Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player. He is very good and plays many different types of music. He comes from a family that doesn't have a lot of music. When he was a boy, his father gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present. Hakan loved it and started playing right away. He was lucky to have a good teacher who helped him practice and learn.

Hakan's teacher, Bo Nilsson, was very good at playing the trumpet too. He taught Hakan how to play and helped him to find his own special sound. Hakan thinks that the trumpet is a special instrument because it's not perfect and you have to learn to work with its imperfections.

Hakan grew up listening to his favorite trumpet player, Maurice Andre. He wanted to be just like him and play solo, not in an orchestra. He studied in Paris with another good teacher, Pierre Thibaud. Hakan's teacher told him that playing in an orchestra is like digging in a garden, it's not very exciting. Hakan realized that he had a special gift for communicating with people through his music. He entered a competition and did well, even though he didn't win first prize.

Hakan thinks that his gift for communicating through music is special and can't be explained. He just knows that it makes people feel something and that's what's important.

**Leadership: What Makes a Good Leader?**

A leader is someone who inspires and helps others to work together. They show the way forward and make things happen. Leadership is not about being tall or smart. It's about being enthusiastic and believing in yourself.

A good leader should be able to speak clearly and confidently. They should be able to motivate others and make them want to work together. According to Pat Dixon, a leader should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"".

Anyone can be a leader, but it takes practice and learning. You can start by recognizing your own strengths and using them to help others. You can also learn from others who are good leaders.

A good leader makes their team feel important and valued. They listen to others and give them support. They also set goals and help their team achieve them.

You can improve your leadership skills by:

* Finding what you are passionate about and using it to inspire others
* Thinking of yourself as a leader and recognizing your strengths
* Trying different leadership styles and seeing what works best
* Setting goals and working to achieve them
* Practicing communication and learning from mistakes
* Being visible and accessible to others, but also knowing when to step back and let others take the lead.

I used to work as a journalist, but I took a break from my job and felt out of touch with the new technology. I decided to start working from home and turn my family home into an office. I was 37 years old and realized that I needed to get back to work quickly. My CV was old-fashioned and I didn't know how to use a computer. I didn't even know how to use a calculator! I was the only one in my family who didn't know how to use technology. 

I entered a competition and won a computer package for my family. We got a laptop and a personal computer. We started using the Internet and learned new words like ""cyberspace"" and ""surfing"". We started talking to people from all over the world on the Internet. My children were already good at using computers from school, but I was not. I was worried that I would make a mistake and lose my work. But I learned slowly and easily. I started working as a freelancer for a magazine and wrote two articles a month.

The computer has changed my work. I used to lose important papers, but now I have a computer and I can keep track of my work. I can research stories on the Internet and talk to other journalists. It's great to work from home, but sometimes it can be lonely and distracting.

In other countries, the situation is different. In Asia, newspaper sales are going up. And magazines about news and current events are also doing well. Even books are still popular. People are buying e-books, but they are also still buying physical books.

Different countries have different stories to tell. In some countries, newspaper sales are going down, but in others they are staying the same or even going up.

**Taking Pictures of People**

People are the most interesting things to take pictures of. When someone is in a picture, it is usually more interesting than a picture without people. But it is hard to take good pictures of people. You need to think about their actions, gestures, and expressions.

**Group Shots**

When taking pictures of a group of people, don't make them stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. You can also take pictures from above or below to make it more interesting.

**Posing for Pictures**

People don't usually act naturally in front of a camera. They might look stiff and serious. To help them relax, suggest they sit or stand in a comfortable position. You can also ask them to put their hands in their pockets.

**Looking at the Camera**

When taking a picture, ask the person to look at the camera lens. This makes the picture more interesting. But they might get self-conscious, so remind them to look at the camera just before you take the picture.

**Candid Shots**

Instead of asking people to look at the camera, you can take pictures of them doing something else. This can make the picture more natural and interesting. You can also ask them to focus on something in the picture.

**Facial Expressions**

People's facial expressions tell us a lot about them. A happy face makes us happy, and a sad face makes us feel sorry. Look for natural expressions like smiling, frowning, or laughing.

**Background**

When taking pictures of people, think about the background. You can make the background interesting by using a wide-angle lens or moving the camera to a different position. Make sure the person is not too small in the picture.

**Interaction**

When taking pictures of people together, look for moments when they are interacting with each other. This can make the picture more interesting. You can also take pictures of people doing something together, like talking or playing.

**People and Places**

When taking pictures of people in a new place, try to show both the people and the place. Use a wide-angle lens and move back to get the whole scene in the picture. Ask the people to come closer to the camera so they are not too small in the picture.

**Posing or Not Posing**

When taking a picture, think about why you want to take it. If you want to remember someone, you might ask them to pose. But if you're taking a picture of a family, you might want to take a more natural picture.<|eot_id|>"

**The Key to Success: Emotional Intelligence**

The way we work is changing. We are no longer judged just on how smart we are or how well we know our job. Now, we are also judged on how well we work with others. This is important because it helps us decide who will be successful and who will not.

The new way of thinking says that we all have the same level of intelligence and technical skills. What matters now is how we work with others. This includes being able to work together, be understanding, and communicate well.

In the past, we were taught that being good at school was important. But now, it's not enough. We need to be able to work well with others to be successful. This is called emotional intelligence.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control our own feelings and those of others. It's important because it helps us work together smoothly and achieve our goals.

Many companies are now teaching emotional intelligence to their employees. This is because it helps them work better together and be more successful. In the future, emotional intelligence will be even more important because jobs will change and we will need to be able to adapt.

The good news is that emotional intelligence can be learned and improved as we grow older. We can become better at understanding and controlling our emotions, and working well with others. This is important because the job market is changing and we need to be able to adapt.

Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution, but it can help us be more successful in our jobs and in life.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a level suitable for A2 learners:

Acupuncture is a very old way of treating people. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine. This includes things like using herbs, massage, and special exercises. Acupuncture is used to help people feel better from many different problems. Doctors in the West are especially interested in using acupuncture to help with pain.

Traditional Chinese medicine thinks that our bodies have a special energy called Qi. This energy flows through our bodies along special paths called meridians. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, we might feel sick or weak. Acupuncturists try to find where the Qi is blocked and fix it.

Acupuncturists use very thin needles to help the Qi flow. They might also use heat or pressure to help the Qi move. People might feel a strange feeling when the needle is put in, but it's not usually painful.

Acupuncture can help with many kinds of pain, like back pain, headaches, and arthritis. Some people use it because they have tried other treatments and it's the only thing that helps. Acupuncturists think that it's better to treat the whole person, not just the pain.

Some doctors in the West don't believe in traditional Chinese medicine, but they do think that acupuncture can help with pain. They think it might work because it can stimulate nerves and make us feel better. Acupuncturists say that it can help people feel better and that it's safe.

It's important to find a good acupuncturist and to tell them about any other health problems you have. Some acupuncturists use acupuncture to help people feel better during surgery. This is a new idea that has been used in China for a long time.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at level A2:

The way you write can tell people things about you. In some countries, people use this to help them decide if someone is good for a job. Handwriting analysis is like a science. It can help us know if someone has a heart problem or cancer. It can also tell us about their personality and emotions.

Some big companies use handwriting analysis to help them choose the right person for a job. But many doctors and psychiatrists don't think it's very useful. A graphologist named Patricia Marne thinks it's important. She says that handwriting can tell us about someone's social class, intelligence, and even if they are honest or not.

She says that people who commit crimes often have bad handwriting. She can also tell if someone is going to get into trouble or if they are feeling stressed. Handwriting can even help us know if someone is going to hurt themselves.

Patricia Marne says that handwriting can tell us many things about a person. For example, if someone writes in a special way, it might mean they are clever or artistic. If they write in all capital letters, it might mean they are trying to hide something. If their writing is very light, it might mean they are sensitive.

But not everyone agrees with Patricia Marne. Some people think that handwriting is just a product of how we learn to write and doesn't say anything about who we are.<|eot_id|>"

Chewing gum is very popular. People in the United States chew 12 million sticks every day. Let's find out how this old habit became a big business.

Chewing gum is not very good for you. It only has a few calories, but it is still a food, so it has to follow special rules. Most gum is made from chemicals and other things that make it taste good and feel smooth.

A long time ago, people in Greece chewed a special kind of gum made from a tree. Women liked to use it to clean their teeth and make their breath smell good. In America, people chewed a type of gum that came from spruce trees. This was the first gum that people sold in stores.

In the 1800s, people found a new kind of gum called chicle. It came from a special tree in Central America. This gum was better than the old kind because it was smoother and more fun to chew. Soon, many people started making gum from chicle.

But it's hard to find chicle, so people started making gum from other things. Today, most gum is made from chemicals and other ingredients. Some people still collect chicle, but it's hard work. They have to climb trees and deal with bugs and snakes.

Gum companies are always trying to make new and better gum. They add different flavors and textures to make it more fun. Some people like to chew gum because it helps keep their teeth clean. When you chew gum, it makes your mouth make more saliva, which helps clean your teeth.

Now, a lot of land in America is used to grow mint, which is used in many popular gum flavors.<|eot_id|>"

We had felt safe and sheltered in our valley, but then the snow came. It was deep and blocked our path. The wind was strong, but we were safe in our valley. The real problem was the river, the Ryburn. It was usually calm, but if it had not been controlled by a dam, it could have been a disaster. The snow started to melt, and the river began to rise. We watched the clouds and the river every day. The clouds were dark and twisted, and the river was getting wilder. The dam was filling up and was about to overflow. Finally, it happened - the dam burst, and the water rushed down the river. The stream was deep and wild near our house. We were worried for three days, but the dam held, and the water went back down. Before the dam was built, the river would flood the nearby villages. Now, the dam keeps the water back, and we can enjoy the big clouds and the river's power. We feel safe in our valley.""

But it didn't work out like that. We mostly did it by phone, and people preferred to read reviews from one person who specialized in one area. So, I chose to focus on film.

I like collecting things. Many people do too. Some people collect stones, shells, or toys. I have been collecting things all my life. I like flowers, pottery, and paintings. When I was a child, my parents took me to a museum. I was fascinated by the old things there.

Many people collect things because it makes them happy. Some people collect because it's the only thing they can control. I just like collecting. A long time ago, a rich man in France had a special room with many strange things. Another rich person in Russia had over 4,000 paintings.

You don't have to be rich to collect things. I collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I looked for them everywhere. One day, I found a special tulip, but someone stole it from me. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I looked for them all over the USA. But one day, my house caught fire and my collection was destroyed.

I think it's interesting when people buy and sell things. A spoon that belonged to a king or a famous person can be very valuable. When people like something, it becomes more valuable. Old toys from the 1950s are now valuable if you still have the boxes and the toys inside.

Michael, one of the boys, said, 'I dare you to jump down!' He jumped and laughed. The others were scared, but Michael encouraged them to jump too. They all jumped and laughed together.

After a while, one of the boys said, 'Let's do it again!' But Michael didn't want to. He was scared. The others waited for him to jump, but he didn't. They started to get tired and went down to the ground. Michael was left alone on the roof. He was thinking about how he was scared. He stayed there for a long time.

Finally, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and jumped. He landed on the sawdust and lay there for a while. The sun was setting and the workmen had gone home. Michael got up and went home. He was late for dinner and his stepmother was angry with him. He felt ashamed and didn't want to talk to anyone.

I changed the following to make it more accessible to an A2 level learner:

* Simplified vocabulary: I used simpler words and phrases to describe the setting and characters.

* Added context: I added more context to help the reader understand the story, such as describing the setting and the characters' emotions.

If you are not happy in your job, you can get help from a career advisor. They will ask you to tell them about your past and then do some tests. The tests are like a puzzle game. You will also talk to the advisor and they will give you a report with some suggestions. These suggestions might surprise you. You might find out you have skills you didn't know you had.

Donna Laney was a marketing manager, but she lost her job and decided to get help from a career advisor. The advisor told her she was good at design, but it would cost a lot of money to learn. She decided to use her old skills and move to a new job that was better for her.

Juliet Greene was bored with her job at a bank and wanted a new challenge. She went to a career advisor and took some tests. The advisor told her she was interested in science, so she decided to study geology.

Not everyone has a good experience with career advisors. Amanda Margetts was a sales representative who was unsure what to do next. She went to a career advisor, but the advisor didn't tell her anything new or surprising. She felt like a friend could have given her the same advice.

'Is the Dentist's a Fun Place? 

In Glasgow, there is a dentist's office called W. Lloyd Jerome's. It's a modern place with bright paintings on the walls and a blue couch where patients sit. Dr. Jerome wants to make people feel comfortable, not scared. He says many people only go to the dentist when they have a problem, because they are afraid. So, he tries to make the office feel relaxing and fun.

He doesn't wear a white coat like many dentists do. He thinks this makes people think of pain. Instead, he wants his patients to feel relaxed and enjoy their visit. He uses special machines that look like video game headsets to make patients feel more at ease. They can watch a movie while he checks their teeth.

The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Dr. Jerome wants people to feel like they're not at a regular dentist's office. He takes his job very seriously, but he also wants his patients to feel comfortable. He uses special tools that make cleaning their teeth feel gentle and painless.

Dr. Jerome went to the United States to learn new ways to make dentistry better. He found that when patients are happy, it makes it easier for the dentist to do their job. He wants to change the way dentists work in the UK to make it more friendly and relaxed.'

'Chocolate is a popular food that comes from South America. A long time ago, the Aztecs and Mayans grew a special tree called the cacao tree. They used its seeds to make a drink called chocolate. The drink was bitter and was used for special occasions.

Later, the Spanish came to South America and took some of the cacao seeds back to Europe. They added sugar and cinnamon to make the drink taste better. The rich people in Europe liked to drink chocolate in special houses called chocolate houses.

In the 1800s, a man named CJ van Houten invented a way to make chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate bars. A company in England called Cadbury made a popular chocolate bar called Dairy Milk. They advertised it as a healthy snack and it became very popular.

Today, people in Britain eat a lot of chocolate, especially at Easter. Some chocolate companies are trying new ways to sell chocolate, like putting it in ice cream or drinks. But some farmers who grow the cacao seeds are having trouble because the price of the seeds is low. Maybe we should think about them when we eat our chocolate.'

Peter Cooke is 83 years old and very good at making things with shells. He likes to make small and beautiful objects like ornaments and flowers. He has been doing this for 10 years and is very happy with his work.

Peter shows me his apartment and his shells. He says, ""Do you think I'm boring?"" But he's not boring, he's enthusiastic. He loves what he does and it shows.

Some friends told Peter to have an exhibition in London, and 70% of the things he showed were sold. Now, he has another exhibition and the prices are very high - up to £2,000 for some things.

Peter says he doesn't decide how much his things cost. He just makes them because he loves it. He says, ""I wish I had started doing this earlier, but I'm still making the best things I can.""

Peter's work is very different from the usual shell decorations you find at the beach. He uses special glue and washing-up liquid to make his creations. He travels to different countries to find the most beautiful shells.

Some people write to Peter and say he's taking too many shells from the beach. But Peter says he only takes dead shells and doesn't disturb the living creatures. He thinks it's okay to collect shells if they're already empty.

The best thing about Inter-Rail was that I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month. I just needed to buy one ticket. I slept on the train and carried my things in a backpack. This made me feel free and carefree.

I didn't plan my trip very well. I just wanted to see new places and have fun. My friends and I went to France, and then we kept going to other countries. We didn't care about the cost. We just wanted to explore.

""When you travel to another country, it's very frustrating to find out that your luggage is missing. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your bag. This can be especially bad if you're in a different climate or far from home and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Airlines don't always tell us how many bags they lose, but it's true that sometimes they make mistakes. Even good airlines can lose luggage. The airline system is like this: they want you to arrive at the airport early so your bag can get on the plane. They also make sure you have enough time to change planes if you need to. But sometimes flights are delayed and this can cause problems with your luggage. Sometimes people make mistakes or things get lost. This can happen more often at big airports where many people are transferring planes. If you're going to a big airport, it's a good idea to take a direct flight and check in early. If you have to change planes, try to fly with the same airline and give yourself extra time to get to your next flight. Make sure to put your name and address on your luggage, both inside and out. If your luggage still goes missing, you need to tell the airline official at the airport and fill out a special form before you leave.<|eot_id|>"

Gareth used to love collecting things like flowers and butterflies when he was a child. But now he sees that farming has affected the countryside. He thinks that farmers and conservationists used to argue a lot, but now they are working together.

Gareth's job is to make sure that the Trust's land is taken care of. He also helps with things like planting trees and meeting the farmers who work on the land.

Some children are very good at music. It's not always easy to know how to help them develop their talent. Some parents might not notice their child's musical ability until they get upset or behave badly. Schools are good at helping children who are good at other subjects, but music schools are special because they understand and support children who are very good at music.

There are five music schools in Britain that are especially for children who are good at music. These schools have professional musicians who help the children learn and practice. The children spend most of their day doing music activities, like playing instruments, singing, or conducting. They also have some time for regular subjects like English, maths, and science.

The schools are small and have a lot of teachers, so the children get a lot of attention. Most children who go to these schools live at the school, which means they are with other children who like music just like them. This can be helpful for some children.

However, there are some problems. The schools are expensive, and it can be hard for some families to afford the fees. Some parents might not want their children to go to boarding school, especially when they are very young. The schools try to help by offering scholarships and other ways to make it more affordable.

Some people think that sending children to music school too early can be bad for them. They might feel too much pressure and stress. The schools try to make sure that the children are happy and healthy, and they offer help if they need it.

Some people think that music schools are not the best choice for every child. Some children are good at music and other subjects, and they might do well in a regular school with a good music program. There are also music colleges that offer music lessons on Saturdays, which might be a good option for some families.<|eot_id|>"

Do you want to publish your writing? Margaret Stubbs can help. Many people write to her and ask, 'Where should I send my story?' First, you need to learn about the market and the publishers. You also need to practice your writing. To do this, read a lot of books and magazines. Visit your local library and bookstores. This will help you understand what kind of writing publishers want.

If you're not sure what you want to write, start by finding out what types of stories magazines are looking for. For example, if you like writing love stories, find out which magazines publish them.

I was waiting for a train at the station in Baltimore. It was a busy day and there were many people around. I saw an older man talking to different people. He was well-dressed and looked important. He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia and she said no. Then he asked another woman and she said yes. He asked me, but I didn't answer. He looked stressed and was asking people for help. He said his daughter was going to leave for a year to study abroad and she had forgotten her passport. He asked a woman if she could help him find someone to bring the passport to her. The woman was kind and asked him why he didn't go himself. He said his wife was in a wheelchair and he couldn't leave her alone. I thought this was a bad excuse. I noticed that the man had a big envelope in his hand. It was padded and stapled shut. I thought it might be important.

My son Gary is a famous chef on TV. His father, John Moore, is a restaurant owner. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. His chance was to run a restaurant. When he saw the restaurant, it was in bad shape. But John liked it because it reminded him of his childhood. He grew up with a single mother who worked hard. John wanted to have a family life, so his wife took care of the children and did the books. They lived above the restaurant and had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident.

Gary was a lively child. He loved to play in the bath and even knocked himself out once! He started working for pocket money at a young age and helped in the kitchen every weekend. He was very responsible and got up early every morning. John was proud to see Gary helping out in the family business.

Gary wasn't good at school, but he loved cooking. By the time he was 15, he was as good as the other cooks in the restaurant. He even got to be in charge sometimes. John knew Gary would go into cooking because he had a talent for it.

Gary started playing the drums and now has his own band. John told him to focus on one thing at a time, not to chase two things at once. Gary went to cooking school at 17 and did very well. He was preparing meals for his classmates in just one hour! John is very proud of Gary's success on TV. He thinks Gary listened to his advice and worked hard to achieve his goals.

People love dolphins. They are very smart and can understand human emotions. We see them in movies and at the seaside. But did you know that dolphins are in trouble? Mark Simmonds tells us about the problems they face.

There are many types of dolphins. Some live in the open sea, and we don't know much about them. Others live near our coastlines. There used to be many bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises near our coast, but now there are very few. The ones that are left are often sick or hurt.

Dolphins have a hard time finding food because there is not enough fish in the sea. Fishermen's nets can also hurt them. Sometimes dolphins get caught in the nets and die. They can also eat food that is bad for them, like old fish or chemicals in the water.

Female dolphins can pass these bad things to their babies through their milk. This can be very dangerous for the babies. Noise pollution from ships and other things can also disturb dolphins. We don't know exactly how, but it might be very bad for them.

We should take care of dolphins and their homes. We can do this by not polluting the sea and by not overfishing. We should also make sure that fishermen's nets are safe for dolphins.<|eot_id|>"

""Exercise is good for you. It helps your body, mind, and spirit. It's a great way to stay healthy when life is busy and stressful. There are many reasons why exercise is good for you. It makes your muscles stronger, helps you lose weight, and improves your posture. It also helps prevent injuries and makes you feel more energetic. 

Exercise can even help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems. It can also help with stress and some medical conditions. There are many types of exercise you can do, such as aerobics, jogging, or weightlifting. Remember to start slowly and carefully, and ask your doctor for advice if you're not sure. 

Good posture is important too. If you slouch, try imagining a helium balloon attached to the top of your head, pulling you up. This will help you stand up straight and breathe easier. Stretching exercises can also help you move more easily and prevent injuries. 

A good exercise routine should include warming up, stretching, a strong workout, and cooling down. This will help you stay fit and healthy.""<|eot_id|>"

I met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. She's very busy preparing for the World Championships. She teaches at a school and then trains in a car park. I was surprised to hear that! She said she's too focused on her movements to notice anything else.

Kendra is very dedicated to her training. She wants to be the best she can be for the World Championships. This is her fourth time playing in the championships. There will be 27 teams from different countries, and England will have a big home crowd cheering for them.

Kendra's team is currently number four in the world. But she knows it will be tough. They have to play every day, with no rest in between games. But she's confident they can win. She says that once the game is over, they all become friends again.

Netball has changed a lot since Kendra started playing. The game is faster and more competitive now. Players are more aggressive. But Kendra believes that all the hard work is worth it if they win.

As captain, Kendra wants to be a good leader and support her team. She plans to stop playing netball after the World Championships and maybe become a coach in the future. She's very excited to lead her team in the opening ceremony and have her fans cheering her on.'<|eot_id|>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves the ocean. She studies the chemicals in the sea. She teaches at a university in Southampton. When she's not teaching, she goes on special trips to the bottom of the ocean. She drives a small car-sized vehicle down to the sea floor to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, it's very small and dark. There's no room to stand up or move around. Rachel and the pilots have to stay inside until they get back to the surface. A dive can take 16 hours. If something goes wrong, Rachel can press a button and a small boat will take her to the surface quickly.

Rachel has made six trips to the ocean floor. Last year, she went with a Russian team to study a special area with many underwater volcanoes. They were blowing black smoke and it was very hot. Rachel loves her job because she gets to study these amazing things. She's never been scared, except once when there was a big explosion. But they were okay and it was a big relief.

It's an amazing feeling to be at the bottom of the ocean and see the volcanoes for the first time. Rachel feels lucky to be able to do this job and see things that no one else has ever seen before.

**First Impressions are Important**

When we meet someone for the first time, we make an impression of them in just a few minutes. We notice how they dress, their body language, and how they speak. We also notice if they are on time or late.

Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard and got a degree. She went to an interview at a school, but she didn't get the job. The Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take care of themselves, what kind of teacher will they be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""When we look good, we feel good. And when we feel good, we do a good job."" Many people don't realize how important it is to look professional.

Janet Goodwood worked in an office for 10 years, but she didn't get a promotion. The Director of Personnel told her she didn't look like an office manager. He said she should change her clothes before applying again.

Our body language and facial expressions also matter. A psychologist found that 55% of what we say comes from our facial expressions. If our words and facial expressions don't match, the listener will believe the facial expression.

It's also important not to be too eager or too desperate for a job. Sheila Rice got a job offer, but she was too excited. The boss knew she would accept the job, so he offered her a lower salary.

Finally, it's important to know about the company before an interview. You can read the annual report to learn about the company's projects. You can also prepare some questions to ask during the interview.

**Four Young Athletes Talk About Their Lives**

Darius (runner) - I like sports. I played many sports when I was young, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I decided to focus on running instead. My biggest achievement was running for my country and getting a medal. I wish people had written about it in the newspaper, because it would have been nice to get some sponsorship. I train a lot during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun, but you have to be disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before a big run, I have to say no.

Gabriel (surfer) - The surfing community is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Surfers are very serious and the best waves are usually early in the morning. You have to give up late nights to get good waves. I don't mind, but I do like sleeping in. It's worth it because it helps me win competitions. After I win, I like to have a big celebration and go on a nice trip.

Dieter (yacht racer) - It's fun to be on a boat with my friends. We always celebrate our wins in a big way. People sometimes say we're silly when we're out having fun, but we don't try to get attention. Reporters like to write about where we go out and what we do there more than about how well we did in the race. I'm away from home for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back and do normal things with my friends. I'm known in the sailing world, but nobody really recognizes me in the street. I like getting letters from fans and I always reply.

Tomas (tennis player) - It's great to walk onto the court and feel like the crowd is supporting me. Sometimes it gets crazy with too many people around, but I like being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. It's not all good, though. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. As a tennis player, you have to travel a lot and make sacrifices. I'm okay with that because I can focus on my game and enjoy other things in life when I retire.<|eot_id|>"

Shopping with children can be very difficult. They always want something new and exciting. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Parents feel guilty when they say no to their children's requests. They worry that they are not letting their children make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are shopping with their parents. Advertisers spend a lot of money to make children want to buy things. They use TV ads and other ways to persuade children to ask their parents for things. 

Parents have different opinions about what is good or bad for their children. Some parents are worried about what they give their children to eat. They want to teach their children to make good choices, but it's hard when there are so many advertisements trying to influence them. 

Some parents feel stressed when they are shopping with their children. They have to decide what to buy and what not to buy. They might feel guilty if they say no to their children's requests. 

One mother says she talks to her children about food and helps them understand what is good and what is not. She is happy that her children are critical of advertisements. 

Some parents admit that they are not consistent in their answers to their children's requests. They might say no to one thing, but yes to another. It's hard to be consistent, especially when children are asking for things they want.

Supermarkets could make it easier for parents and children to shop together. They could remove sweets from the checkout area or provide a play area for children. This might make parents happy and encourage them to shop more often.<|eot_id|>"

""Ice Skating

Ice skating has been around for a very long time. People used to make skates from animal bones. The first skates were made of bone and were used until people started using iron. In some countries, ice skating was important for the rich people. 

In the past, ice skating was only for special people. But then a girl named Sonja Henie started skating in a new way. She made ice skating popular again. Now, ice skating is a mix of art and sport. 

To start ice skating, you need to balance and control. You need to bend your knees and lean forward a little. You should also relax and not be stiff. 

When you start skating, you should put your feet together and push off with one foot. Then, move the other foot a little bit. If you practice, you can get better and better. 

It's important to know how to fall safely. Even good skaters fall sometimes. To get up, you need to get on your knees and then stand up. 

There are different ways to skate, like figure skating and speed skating. But first, you should learn the basics of figure skating. 

To be a good skater, you need to practice regularly. You should also warm up before you skate and do exercises to loosen up your body. 

Ice skating is good for your body. It helps you balance, move well, and feel relaxed. It's also good for your heart and lungs. You can even do it with swimming or jogging to stay healthy and fit.""<|eot_id|>"

Do you know how tall people are getting? Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain. He is 228 cm tall! This is because people are getting taller every year. But it's not because we are becoming a new kind of superhuman. Instead, we are going back to how our ancestors used to be.

Long ago, people didn't eat the same food we do today. They ate many different foods like fruits, berries, and plants. They even ate animals sometimes. This food helped them stay healthy and strong. But then, people started farming and eating the same foods all the time. This was not good for their health. They became shorter and weaker.

Now, some countries like Europe, the US, and Japan are eating better and getting taller again. But there are still problems. We can't keep growing forever. We need to stop growing at some point. Scientists think we might stop growing when we reach 193 cm tall. But there's another problem. The Earth is getting warmer, and that might make us smaller again.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in a TV studio when a show is being filmed? I went to a studio to find out. People often think that studio audiences are just a bunch of silly people who want to be on TV. But that's not true. People from all walks of life come to the studio. They come to watch different types of shows, like game shows or comedy shows.

I thought that people only came to the studio because they wanted to be on TV. But that's not the main reason. Most people just want to have a fun night out and watch a live show. Some people like to see how TV shows are made and what happens behind the scenes. Others like to be part of a live audience and feel like they're involved in the show.

I went to a studio to see what it's like. It was a bit boring and uncomfortable, but it was also exciting. I got to see the actors and comedians up close, and I felt like I was a part of the show. But it's not the same as watching TV at home. At home, you can see everything clearly and comfortably. In the studio, you have to follow the signs that tell you when to clap or laugh.

I like places with people, not just nature. When I travel, I like to visit old villages and towns. When I was a child, I went to school in England and loved exploring the countryside on my bike. I would ride to a village called Lastingham and visit the old hills and valleys. I liked the landscape because it was familiar, but different from my home in Scotland.

I like a train ride from Hythe to Dungeness. The train goes through a marshy area with sheep and a canal. The best part is when the train goes through people's backyards. I see people doing everyday things, like making tea or washing dishes. I like looking at ordinary things and finding something special.

The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and quiet place. The beaches are hard to get to, so there are not many people. People who do visit like to look at the sea and think about its power. The coast is known for shipwrecks, and there are nice walks you can take to explore the area.

My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a big open area with no many people. I like the feeling of being alone. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I go back every year. It's a special place for me because I can be alone and think.

I bought a house in England called Glenthorne. It's a peaceful place where I can relax and remember my childhood. I used to live in Sri Lanka, but I went to school in Devon, England. I loved cycling around the countryside and visiting the village. There was one place we never rode past because it was said that if you went down the driveway, you would never come back.

'Old drawings on a mountain in France are being damaged. These drawings are very old, from 4,000 years ago. They show cows, fields, and gods and goddesses. Many people visit this mountain every year. Unfortunately, some visitors are not careful and damage the drawings. They walk on them, rub them with their hands, and even take pieces of the rock as souvenirs. This is very bad because the drawings will not last for many years if this continues.

Some experts think that the government should make the mountain a 'no-go' area, so only guided tours can visit. Others think that people should still be able to visit the mountain, but they should be careful and not damage the drawings. The problem is that there is not enough money to hire guards to stop people from damaging the drawings.

One expert thinks that the only way to save the drawings is to rope off the area and have guides show people around. Another expert thinks that it is better to let people visit the mountain, but charge them a fee to help pay for the guards. The Ministry of Culture has said that the area is important and should be protected. If we don't take care of it, the drawings will be lost forever.'

Parents feel guilty when they say no, but they also feel bad if they say yes. They worry about what their children eat and don't want to give in to their demands.

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes when they go shopping with their parents. Advertisers spend a lot of money on TV ads to make children want things. Parents try to explain why they can't buy everything, but children don't always understand.

Some parents feel stressed when deciding what to buy and what not to buy. They want their children to make their own choices, but it's hard to say no all the time. Some parents are inconsistent and sometimes say yes to things they shouldn't.

Supermarkets could make shopping easier by moving sweets away from the checkout or providing play areas for children. This would make parents happy and might even attract more customers.

Note: I simplified the text by using shorter sentences, removing complex vocabulary, and focusing on the main ideas. I also removed some of the quotes and statistics to make the text more concise and easier to understand.<|eot_id|>"

""Climbing is a popular sport. People used to go to mountains to climb. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. A famous French climber, Francois Lombard, is climbing at the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham. He is hanging upside down from his fingers.

A long time ago, climbers used to climb on cliffs. But in the winter, it was cold and they couldn't climb. So, they found other things to climb on, like brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong.

Some sports centers started building special climbing walls. These walls had special edges for climbers to hold onto. A teacher named Don Robinson built the first climbing wall in a school corridor. He put natural rock in a block of concrete and then built a wall around it.

Many more climbing walls were built in the 1970s. But they had some problems. The walls were only straight up and down, not like the cliffs outside. Climbers got bored with the same old walls. Then, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a new material that could be shaped like the rocks on the cliffs. You could put it on any wall and take it off when you got bored. Now, climbers can climb on walls that are like the cliffs, with overhangs and angles. It's a lot of fun!""

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2:

Do you want to be an actor? Many people think it's a bad idea. There are more people who want to be actors than there are jobs for them. If you tell your friends you want to be an actor, they might say you're crazy. But it's a big decision, and only you can make it. There's no easy way to become an actor. You can't just take a test and pass it. You need luck and talent. But there are always new opportunities and exciting experiences.

What makes someone a good actor? It's hard to explain. I think it's a combination of natural ability and imagination. And it takes courage and believing in yourself. When you act, you want to connect with the audience. That's what makes acting special. Actors don't know why they're good at it. They just know what they do well and what they can improve on. But they never take anything for granted. They know they can lose their job at any time.

Actors don't talk about their chances of getting a part. They try to protect themselves from stress and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. It's a risk from the start. When you audition for a part, you're saying you're available, willing, and talented enough. If you don't care, nobody else will.<|eot_id|>"

Many people are getting taller. Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain. He is 228 cm tall. This is because people's average height is growing by one centimetre every decade.

In the past, people ate different foods. They ate fruits, vegetables, and meat. This made them strong and healthy. But then, people started farming. This meant they ate more carbohydrates like bread and rice. This was not good for their health.

For a long time, people did not eat well. They were not as tall or as healthy as their ancestors. But now, some countries are eating better. This means people are getting taller again. In some countries, the average height is 180 cm or more.

But there is a problem. Buildings and cars are not getting taller or bigger. This means people have less space. Some scientists think that people will stop growing taller soon. They think it will happen because of the way we eat and the climate.

They also planted many trees and flowers. The plants had to be strong and able to survive in the salty air near the sea and strong winds.

The models in the village were made by Colin over 9 years. He used different materials like stone, wood, and plastic to make them strong. He learned how to make them by asking experts and practicing. The models are very detailed and look like real buildings. They are all made to look like traditional British buildings, but they are not copies of real places.

You can see many things in the village, like a big house, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models. You can take pictures from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are welcome, but please keep them on a short lead.

We want you to enjoy your visit and have fun! If you press the buttons in front of some models, you can make them move. We are always making new models and want to know what you think of them.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2 CEFR:

Some newspapers in the UK take pictures of famous people without their permission. This is not what the newspapers' rules say they should do. Most people who are famous don't want their private moments to be shown in the newspapers. But very few of them go to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to complain. The PCC is meant to help with problems like this.

The PCC should look into some of these cases, but it rarely does. The PCC should also look into a recent story about a famous pop star's private life. The pop star didn't complain, but someone else should have. 

The PCC could take on a bigger role and stop newspapers from publishing private pictures. But this would be difficult. The PCC would have to decide which pictures are private and which are not. Celebrities might get upset if the PCC doesn't look into all the stories about them. 

There are many problems with the PCC taking on this role. How would it decide which cases to look into? Would it ask the person involved to complain? If they don't want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? 

It's hard to find a solution to this problem.<|eot_id|>"

Instead, we are talking about people who have been in their first job for a while and are now looking for a new one that fits with their long-term plans. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on what you want to do in the future. Do you want to specialize in a certain area, take on more responsibilities, or move to a different field? Whatever you choose, make sure you choose a job that you will stay in for at least two or three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job, because it will show that you have thought about your career and are serious about your future. The most important things to look for in a job are that it will help you grow, give you new challenges, and give you more responsibility. If you love to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you get back and then find a new job. Employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and are not likely to get bored again.

Grasslands are home to many animals, big and small. They all need grass to survive. Grass grows back quickly if it is cut or damaged.

'Tom Cruise is a famous actor. He is very good at his job. But when he was a little boy, he was shy and had trouble making friends. He liked acting in school plays. After he finished school, Tom went to New York to look for a job. He worked as a porter and took acting classes. A famous director, Franco Zeffirelli, gave Tom his first film job in 1980. Ten years later, Tom was very successful and earned a lot of money. Today, Tom still acts in films and many people love him around the world.'

'Little Cat, Where Are You?

Bo, a little cat, went on a big adventure. She got into a big van with furniture. The driver was surprised to see her there! He had driven the van a long way - over 500 kilometres. It was late and he was tired. He and Bo were both hungry.

The driver gave Bo some milk and asked around to see if anyone was missing a cat. But no one had lost a cat. It was getting dark, so he took Bo home with him. The next morning, he took her to a special place for animals.

The cat's owner was also looking for Bo. He searched everywhere, but couldn't find her. Then he remembered the furniture van that had delivered something to his neighbour. He remembered the company's name and called them. Soon, Bo was back home safe and sound.'<|eot_id|>"

A long time ago, people wanted to build a train line from Adelaide to Darwin, but it was hard because of floods. Now, the train is faster and has few stops. Most people who take the Ghan are on holiday. The train was built to carry goods, not people. It's a special train because it's the first one to go from north to south. When I got on the train, everyone was excited. We stopped at Katherine and some people went on a boat trip. I got off at Alice Springs and went on a trip to a big rock called Uluru (Ayers Rock). We walked around the rock and saw the sunset. Many people break their journey in Alice Springs because there are two trains a week going south. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting, just flat land with cows. But on the third day, we reached the hills near the ocean. My journey was over, and even though the train didn't do everything it promised, it showed me some amazing sights in Australia.""<|eot_id|>"

'Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It's a big mountain, and it can be very cold because it's in the north. My friend Keith went climbing there for the first time. He went up the north side of the mountain to a place called Tower Ridge. It's a long way up - 600 metres. They planned to stay in a special place on the mountain for three days. They took big tents, warm sleeping bags, and special shoes with spikes. You need these things because the snow is very hard and slippery.

Even though some of the group were very experienced, they brought safety things like lights, helmets, and extra clothes. The weather was good, but they were still a little worried. Ben Nevis is a big challenge in the winter.

The path got steeper and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest one, so I had to stop more often. The others would wait for me and then we would continue. I promised myself to train more before climbing again.

After 200 metres, we reached Tower Ridge. It's very narrow and the mountain drops down very far on both sides. We had to be very careful and slow. After seven hours, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and even a small island called Skye. But on this day, there was mist.

Going down the mountain can be just as hard as going up. You need to read the map carefully, or you might get lost. I was glad we took turns doing this job. When I was safe in my tent, I finally felt happy about the experience. I made it to the top!'<|eot_id|>"

On Saturday morning, we met the other people in our group. There were 12 of us. We came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we didn't know what we would do.

In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep and coming back up without help. She held her breath for over three minutes, which is very long. A team of safety divers watched her.

Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya says safety is the most important thing. She trains every day, both on land and in the water. She uses a bike to make her heart stronger. She doesn't run because she doesn't want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks quickly to stay fit.

Tanya travels to different places to practice her dives. She does 14 dives in four weeks, with a day off in between. She doesn't want to get tired because it could ruin her training.

When Tanya is not training, she goes to public events to talk about sports products. She also helps environmental organizations by doing research and making films. Tanya grew up on a Caribbean island and loved swimming and exploring the ocean. She says her life is like living her childhood dreams.

One of the churches is very old. It was built in 1095 and is 900 years old. Norwich celebrated its 800th birthday in 1994. This was a special year because it got a special permission from the king to be a city and make its own decisions.

Norwich is a small city with 150,000 people. But it was once very big and important. In the past, there were many churches and pubs. Today, there are fewer, but there are still many things to do.

Every year, the city of Albuquerque in the United States has a big balloon festival. The sky turns into a rainbow of colors. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate a radio station's 50th birthday. There were only a few balloons, but now there are over 1,000 from all around the world!

What to See

At night, the pilots make their balloons glow, and you can take great photos. But you need to come early or late to see this. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots. There are balloons in all shapes and sizes, even animals and cartoon characters!

You can also take a ride in a balloon over the desert or go on a cable car to the top of the nearby mountains. There are many other things to do, like balloon races and fireworks.

Important Tips

Buy your ticket online to avoid waiting in line. Wear thin clothes and bring sunglasses, suncream, and a flashlight. Don't forget your camera and extra film if you're not using a digital camera.

This festival is very special because of the wind. The mountains help the balloons fly safely and in the right direction. Come and enjoy the Albuquerque Balloon Festival!'<|eot_id|>"

""Some people don't like this book, New Writing 3. I don't understand why. It's a big book with many new stories and writings. You can buy it for not very much money, PS6.99. Most of the book is fiction, like parts of novels and short stories. Some famous writers wrote some of the stories, like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. It's interesting to know that some writers who are not very famous wrote about food. One story, ""Those Nails"" by Jane Harris, is not good to read after eating. It has some yucky parts that might make you feel sick. There are also some good poems by 19 poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Some writers are sharing parts of their unfinished novels. Finally, there are a few non-fiction pieces, including a funny article about newspapers and a strange piece about Ursula Owen.

""Margaret Porter is a violin teacher. She says it's best to start learning the violin when you're between three and six years old. This is because you're learning about the world at this age. Margaret likes to teach three and four-year-olds, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who are very interested. 

Margaret's students have group lessons with about 10 other children. They have one lesson together every two weeks, and one individual lesson with her once a week. Parents also come to the lessons. It's important for parents to help their children learn.

At first, students learn to play the violin by listening. They don't try to read music until they've been playing for a few years. There's a big difference between playing and reading music. Margaret says her way of teaching isn't meant to make great violinists. If some students are very good, she suggests they find a different teacher to help them improve.""<|eot_id|>"

'Moonshine is a music band. They just released their third CD. It's called ""Here again"". The band has changed a little bit. A new person, Tom Wilcott, is playing the bass guitar now. Tom Simpson is playing the drums. The first two songs on the CD are fast and fun to dance to. The rest of the songs are slower and more like the band's usual style. Some fans might be surprised by these new songs. They are very good and could be big hits. The singer, Rob Letchford, does a great job singing. He had some problems with his voice, so the band had to cancel their next tour. But don't worry, the concerts will be rescheduled when Rob feels better. Moonshine can make many different kinds of music. They can make slow songs and fast songs. I think they saved their best songs for the beginning and the end of the CD.

He loved the colors and light in Italy and wanted to put that in his paintings. He paints with thin layers of color, from light to dark. He says it's a secret because he doesn't know what the final result will be.

Aitchison is very good at painting. He says anyone can buy the colors, but it's about choosing the right colors and putting them together. He doesn't make drawings before he starts painting. If he does, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.

Aitchison likes to paint people, but he prefers it when they don't ask to see the painting while he's working on it. If they get worried and want to look, he can't focus. He doesn't follow any special style or tradition in his painting. He just paints the way he likes.

In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family and went to Asia with some friends who liked climbing. She found that climbing Everest was very hard. 'You have to carry everything you need on your back,' she said. 'You can't wash yourself on the mountain. I didn't even bring a toothbrush! There is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink.'

Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993. It was the best moment of her life. After that, she became famous. Now she has written a book about her trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job on a TV show about science. Rebecca is well-known today and she still lives in her little flat in London with her pictures and books about mountains.

'Canada Geese are big birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to go to a warmer place. Canada gets very cold in the winter, and the birds will die if they stay. Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found 16 baby Canada Geese on his farm. The parents were not there. Bill thought, 'The baby birds won't know what to do when autumn comes.' Bill has a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. He flew around with them during the summer. When autumn came, Bill flew to a place called Virginia in the United States, 600 miles away from his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went home. When spring came, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. But they didn't come. So Bill went to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks, but couldn't find them. When he came back home, the geese were waiting for him! They had found their way back home by themselves!'

'ESTHER'S STORY

When Esther was 16, her aunt gave her PS500 for her birthday. Most of her friends went to college, but Esther used the money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and jars and made jam. She sold the jam to her friends for PS1 each. She soon had twice as much money as her aunt gave her.

Esther's parents wanted her to study instead of making jam. They wanted her to be a teacher or a doctor one day. But Esther didn't listen. She kept making jam. After a few months, she started selling it at the market. Then she started making orange juice. She sold it to a school where her friend worked.

Inspector Saunders says that 67% of break-ins happen when people forget to lock a door or window. He also says that it's rare for bad people to break in at night because families are usually at home then. But winter afternoons are good for them because it's dark and they can't be seen. Many people are not at home during this time because they are still at work. Inspector Saunders suggests leaving lights on when you're not at home. This will help keep bad people away.

So, in 1829, the London Police Force started with 3000 officers. Most walked, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers were men.

People like to send postcards to their friends and family. Postcards have pictures of nice places, like the beach or mountains. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are cheap and the pictures are nice. The first postcard was sent a long time ago, in the late 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed pictures of important news, like an accident or a famous person's visit. People liked to see them because they didn't have pictures in their newspapers.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and phrases to make them easier to understand
* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases, such as ""at the end of the nineteenth century"" and ""perhaps an important person's visit""
* Simplified sentence structures, such as using simple present tense instead of past perfect tense
* Removed unnecessary words and phrases, such as ""often have pictures on them are often better than people's own photos""
* Changed some words to make them more concrete and easy to understand, such as ""nice places"" instead of ""beaches, mountains or castles""<|eot_id|>"

'Dinosaurs Nobody has ever seen a dinosaur. A long time ago, about 60 million years ago, the last dinosaur died. We don't know why they all died. Birds are like dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were not all the same. There were many different kinds. Some were small, and some were very big. The biggest dinosaurs were the biggest animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus was 20 metres long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run fast because it had strong back legs.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences to make them easier to understand
* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases
* Used simpler sentence structures
* Removed some details that are not essential to understanding the main idea
* Changed some words to make them more familiar to a learner of level A2 (e.g. ""living relatives"" became ""like dinosaurs"")<|eot_id|>"

""Bears are big animals. They can be strong and hurt people. They are good at climbing trees and running. But they can't see well and find food by smelling. There are seven kinds of bears. The biggest is the polar bear. It's almost three meters tall. There are two kinds of black bears. One lives in North America and the other in Asia. But not all black bears are black. They can be dark brown or reddish brown. Many people like the panda bear. It's black and white and comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest because it's hard to find food.""

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences to make them easier to understand
* Used simpler vocabulary, such as ""big"" instead of ""very strong"" and ""hurt"" instead of ""kill""
* Removed complex phrases, such as ""can be a dangerous animal"" and ""find food by using their noses""
* Changed some sentences to make them more concrete and easy to visualize, such as ""They are good at climbing trees and running"" instead of ""They can climb trees and run very fast""
* Removed the phrase ""like most animals"" as it's not essential to the main idea of the text
* Changed ""it is difficult to find food"" to ""it's hard to find food"" to make the language more conversational and easy to understand.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a learner of English at level A2 (CEFR):

""CROCODILES We can find crocodiles in warm places like Africa, South America, and Australia. They like to live in slow-moving water, but they can swim fast and walk on land too. Crocodiles often live in groups. They eat many things, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes they even eat bigger animals or people. There are many kinds of crocodiles. They all have sharp teeth. When they lose their teeth, they grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually 3.5 metres long, but some are much bigger. They can live for a very long time. One crocodile in a zoo lived for 66 years.""

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs

* Removed complex phrases and sentences (e.g. ""They eat everything they catch, like fish, birds and small animals"")
* Simplified sentence structures (e.g. ""They often lose these teeth, but soon get new ones"" becomes ""When they lose their teeth, they grow new ones"")
* Removed some specific details (e.g. the exact number of types of crocodiles)<|eot_id|>"

'A LONG TIME AGO, two brothers from France made the first balloon to take people up in the air. Later, in 1903, two brothers from the US built the first plane with an engine and flew it. The US government started a special service to send mail by plane in 1918. Planes changed a lot over the next few decades. Then, in the 1950s, planes got much faster because they had special engines. In 1976, a special plane called Concorde was built in the UK and France. It's the fastest plane in the world and can fly very fast. It can take people from London to New York in just four hours! Now, many millions of people travel by plane and it's hard to imagine a world without them.'<|eot_id|>"

'Visiting the theatre in London a long time ago was very different. The building was round and had no roof. If it was raining, people got wet. The queen liked going to the Globe Theatre by the river to watch plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. The audience ate, talked to friends, and walked around during the show. Some people even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. There is a new building in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play or learn about life a long time ago.'

I simplified the text by:

* Shortening the sentences and using simpler vocabulary
* Removing complex phrases and sentences

'Dear Jeff,

I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we got here, the weather was bad and it was cold. But now it's better and we go to the beach every day. This week, we are staying in Sydney. Next week, we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is very warm, so I like swimming there. The fish are different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to go home yet! See you at the end of September. Sue'
