Many countries have a system where people throw away their trash and it gets collected by the government. But this system is not perfect. If people don't have to pay for throwing away their trash, they might throw away more than they need to. This can cause problems because it costs money to collect and get rid of the trash.
Some cities have tried to solve this problem by making people pay for each bag of trash they throw away. This is called a ""pay-as-you-throw"" system. The idea is that if people have to pay for their trash, they will throw away less and recycle more.
Researchers in the United States studied a city called Charlottesville, Virginia, which started a pay-as-you-throw system. They found that people did throw away less trash, but not as much as they thought they would. Some people even started throwing away more trash because they were trying to fit more into each bag. This made the problem worse.
The researchers also found that some people started dumping their trash in other places instead of paying for it to be taken away. This is not good for the environment.
The only good thing that happened was that people started recycling more. But the researchers think that this was because they were already recycling a lot before the pay-as-you-throw system started, not because of the system itself.
Overall, the results of the pay-as-you-throw system were not as good as expected. It's clear that making people pay for their trash can work, but it's not a simple solution."

Work is important, but it's not just about being good at your job. Many people feel unhappy and unfulfilled at work. They feel like they're just doing a job, not enjoying it. This is because work is often about making money, not about being happy or fulfilled.
The author, Theodore Zeldin, wants to change this. He thinks that work should be a way to make us happy and fulfilled, not just a way to make money. He wants to know how work can be changed to make people feel good about themselves, their minds, and their relationships.
The author looks at different jobs and sees that many people are unhappy, even in well-paid jobs. Doctors are stressed, accountants worry about ethics, and architects are not allowed to use their imagination. The author thinks that work should be a way to use our talents and skills, not just a way to earn money.
The author also looks at hotels and sees that many hotel workers are unhappy. They have low salaries and long hours, and are not treated as individuals. The author thinks that hotels could be more than just places to sleep - they could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other.
The author believes that work is a relationship between people, not just a job. He thinks that people should be able to design their own jobs, choose their own colleagues, and have conversations with people from different backgrounds. This would make work more enjoyable and fulfilling.
The author concludes that we need to rethink what work means and how it makes us feel. We need to focus on being happy and fulfilled, not just making money."

""BROADCASTING: How Technology Was Shaped by Society
The word 'broadcasting' comes from an old idea of sowing seeds widely. It's not just an agricultural metaphor, but also a symbol of optimism and growth. It means spreading something to many people, with the hope of getting a good result. The idea of broadcasting assumes that there is a central place where things are sent out from, like a big seed bank. This idea is surprising because a new technology that sends words and pictures through the air was set up in a way that fit with this idea. This technology, called television, was meant to be a big medium that sends information to many people at the same time.
Television is related to other two-way communication technologies like the telephone and telegraph. It's strange that television was designed to be a centralised medium from the start. This is because it fit with the way society and economy were organized at the time. There were some experiments with different ways of organizing television, but they didn't work out.
In the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to make television a two-way communication tool, like a phone. They built their own TV transmitters and receivers, and many people joined in. However, big businesses and the government didn't want this to happen, so they created rules that stopped it.
Television was also used as a way to show movies and plays in public places, especially in the United States. This was seen as a way to compete with the film industry. In many countries, people watched TV in public places, not at home. This was especially true in Germany.
There were some ideas about making TV a more democratic and equal medium, but these ideas didn't work out. The main goal was to make TV a way to reach many people at home, and this is what happened. As people's living standards improved, they started to buy TVs for their homes. This is now happening all over the world.
There is a connection between how society changes and how TV is organized. As society becomes more modern and centralized, TV becomes more centralized too. TV is also a way for governments to reach many people with important information. It's also a way to create a sense of community and national identity. The way TV is organized is closely tied to the way society is organized.""

Sometimes, having many things doesn't make us feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets our needs, but sometimes we start buying too much. Advertising tries to make us feel like we need things to be happy. It says that if we don't have something, we're not good enough. But this is not true.
Advertising is everywhere - on billboards, TV, radio, newspapers, and the internet. It tries to make us buy things we don't need. But we can try to be aware of it and not let it control us.
Caves are interesting and mysterious, so scientists study them. They want to know how they were made and what lives in them. People have been studying caves for a long time, and some people even visit them for fun. Because it's hard to get to some caves, scientists and hobbyists work together to learn about them.
Weather forecasting used to be simple, but now it's a complicated science. We have satellites and computers that give us weather information quickly. But even with all the technology, human observation is still important. People can notice things that computers can't, and this helps scientists make better weather forecasts.

'Music and Theatre: A New Perspective
I used to think that opera is mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually more important. This makes sense, but as someone who comes from a theatre background, I find it hard to adjust.
When I go to a concert or opera, I notice that some people don't know much about music. They might feel embarrassed or overwhelmed by the complexity of the music. Others are amazed by the skill of the performers. Even a good musician has spent years practicing to get to that level.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't always understand how actors learn their lines or appreciate the hard work that goes into a performance. But this doesn't mean they are less appreciative. In fact, audiences and performers connect on a more equal level in the theatre.
I think music could learn from theatre about this connection. Music performances can be very formal, with strict rules and a big gap between the performers and the audience. This can make the experience feel hierarchical and uncomfortable. Sometimes, people applaud between movements or after a difficult piece, which can disrupt the flow of the performance.
There are many efforts to make music more accessible and break down barriers. I remember a special event where a community opera was performed in a cathedral and then in the town. It was amazing, and the audience was involved and engaged.
What I would like to see in music is more experimentation and creativity, like in theatre. Sometimes, this means performing in unusual locations or taking risks. This can be challenging, but it can also be very rewarding.
As someone who loves both theatre and music, I want to see both thrive and for more people to enjoy them. I believe that music can learn from theatre and become more engaging and enjoyable for everyone.'"

I don't like sand when it's not being used to make things like glass or concrete. When it's on the beach, it gets everywhere and is a nuisance. It blows in your face, gets in your food, and can even swallow small things like keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to get off. But when you sit down or step on a towel, it falls off. Sand can stay with you for a long time, even after you've cleaned it off.
Finding a safe and secure home is important. People have been doing this since the beginning of time. Even with modern technology, people still like to use physical keys to lock their doors. A new electronic lock was invented, but it still has a metal key. This is because people feel safer with a physical key.
I was nervous about visiting a modern art museum because I don't understand modern art. I like some of it, like pictures with fur and bright lights. But I don't know much about it. The museum tried to help visitors understand the art by giving them information about each piece. This helped me understand what the art was trying to say.

Making movies is like telling a story. You need to make some changes to the story to make it work for the screen. This can be hard for writers, but it can also be interesting. I worked on a script and I was surprised by how much of the dialogue and description I could leave out and still get the same message across. This doesn't mean that the original dialogue and description were not important. It's just that different media need different things. In a book, you can use more words to help the reader understand. In a movie, you need to show and not tell.
Watching movies is a special experience. You can get lost in the story and forget about your everyday life. But when the movie is over, you go back to reality. Some people don't think movies are a real art form. They just see them as entertainment. But movies can be a way to tell important stories and make people think.
The film studios are like a big building with many rooms. It's hard to find your way around. But people who work there know where everything is. They make movies that take people on adventures and make them forget their problems.
Many people want to make movies. They buy books about how to do it and take classes. Some people even make movies with small cameras and make a lot of money. But it's not always easy. In the past, movie makers had to work for a long time before they could make their own movies. Now, with the help of technology, anyone can make a movie.

In the past, the houses in our neighborhood were all lined up. They were made of orange bricks or white stucco and looked a bit dirty. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from a nearby factory would spread and make the air smell bad. Many mornings, I would see a boy delivering newspapers wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked down the street.
I don't remember much from my early childhood, but I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses going away into the distance. Later, I remember seeing my mother doing laundry in the back room of a house that wasn't ours. My mother was a small, strict woman who was often angry. I never understood why she was angry, and I couldn't make her happy.
My mother was very particular about how we behaved. She would tell me to behave properly and not to touch other people's flowers or gardens. She would also make me sit quietly for a long time, listening to the radio, with my hands folded across my chest. There were many things she didn't want me to do.
As I grew older, I met some of my mother's friends. They were not very friendly and would talk about boring things like the weather and how mean some people were. I felt like I didn't fit in with them.
Growing up in our neighborhood was predictable. Until I was five, I would stay at home and play with toys. Then, I would go to school, which was a short walk away. My mother would sometimes take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk around and look at paintings. My mother wasn't always happy, but sometimes she would make a joke.

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for an A2 level learner:
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. It was getting dark, and the air was thick with mist. I knew this street from when I was a child. My friends and I used to play here. The houses on this street were special to me, just like the little channels on the sidewalk that carried rainwater away from the houses. As I walked, the street got a bit quieter and the houses got smaller. Some things had changed over the years. The wooden porch railings and pillars had been replaced with iron ones, like those you might see in the South or Spain. Some houses that used to be homes had become shops, and some shops had become homes again. I wondered how people lived in those big, empty spaces.
I visited a friend who lived in a big, old warehouse. He was a furniture designer. He wanted his home to be cozy and separate from his work area. He put up a big, wavy sheet of plastic to divide the space. This created a hallway and guided my eye to the kitchen. He wanted the kitchen to be a calm, neutral place where he could cook for friends or work on his designs.
I also read about a writer named Bruce Chatwin. He loved to travel and write about his adventures. His book, In Patagonia, is a famous travel book that is full of imagination and excitement. But Chatwin sometimes mixed fact and fiction, so it's hard to know what's true and what's not.
One summer, I took shelter in my pool during a heavy rainstorm. I swam and played in the water, watching the raindrops create bubbles and fountains. It was a magical moment. As I swam, I thought about swimming all the way from my house to the sea. I wanted to break free from my usual routine and explore the world in a new way.
Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But sometimes we need to get off the beaten path and break free from what's expected. Swimming, walking, or cycling can be a way to do this. It helps us connect with the natural world and discover things we might have missed otherwise."

Charles Darwin thought that people cry for no good reason. But scientists have found that crying is important for people's social relationships. A scientist named John Bowlby said that crying helps babies and their mothers become close. Many people think that children cry because they are helpless. But why do adults still cry? It's not just the sound of crying that matters, but also how it looks. Crying might have helped our ancestors in the past to feel safe and connected with others. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. We might also cry when we hear something sad or beautiful, like music or a speech. We might cry when we watch a sad movie, especially when we're with someone else. It seems that crying helps us connect with others, but scientists are still studying why we cry.

The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. We know it's happening, but we're not sure how much warmer it will get or how it will affect our lives. A warmer climate means changes to the weather all over the world. This will have big effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
We use natural resources to live, like food, cities, and homes. If these resources change, it will affect us. We don't know exactly how the world will change or what's causing it. We know that human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air, which are related to temperature. These gases are building up and might already be affecting the climate.
Scientists use computers to predict what will happen when the Earth gets warmer. They use laws of physics and chemistry to analyze the interaction of temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, these predictions are not exact and are slow and expensive to make.
Most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we've experienced before. The predictions suggest that the Earth will get warmer by 1-3.5°C by 2100, and sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm. There will be more extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts.
Climate change can affect where plants and animals live, the mix of species, and the benefits they provide to humans. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some areas will be affected negatively, while others might benefit. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have led to increased wheat production.
However, many predicted effects of climate change will be negative. Small changes can affect water availability, leading to droughts and water shortages. This will be a problem in arid and semi-arid regions and areas with already high demand or pollution.
The Mediterranean Basin is an example of this, with decreasing precipitation and changes in seasonality. Another effect will be changes to glaciers, which will impact vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures.
The most dramatic effect will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the expansion of the ocean and melting ice. Half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, which will be affected by flooding and inundation. This could lead to millions of environmental refugees.
The consequences will be severe, especially for small, low-lying island states, which could cease to exist if worst-case scenarios are realized."

Art is often difficult to understand because people think about it in the wrong way. They think of art as just the painting, book, or statue itself, rather than what it does to people. This makes it hard to understand why people like certain art. 
Art is often seen as something special and separate from everyday life. But art is actually a part of our everyday experiences. It's like a mountain - it's not just a big rock, it's a part of the earth. 
To understand art, we need to think about how it affects us and how it is connected to our daily lives. We can't just look at a painting and say it's beautiful without thinking about why it makes us feel a certain way. 
Many people enjoy things that they don't think of as art, like movies, music, and comics. This is because they find enjoyment in the everyday things they do. But some people think that art should only be in museums and galleries, and that's not true. Art can be found in many things we do every day.
The key is to understand that art is a part of our daily lives and to think about how it affects us. This will help us appreciate art more and understand why we like certain things."

When I was a child, I liked hearing stories about wise women who could predict the future. One story I heard was about a woman who sold books to a king. The king didn't want to buy the books, so the woman burned some of them. The king eventually bought the remaining books. I learned that sometimes you need to be clever and patient to get what you want.
When I was a child, I didn't have many friends. My mother taught me to do something interesting so that others would want to play with me. This worked, and I learned that being different can be good.
When I grew up, I wanted to write a book about travel. I didn't want to write about just any place. I wanted to write about old ruins because I like to learn about the past.
**Writing a Book**
When you write a book, you send it to a publisher. The publisher has a big pile of books to read. If they like your book, they will show it to someone else. The person who decides whether to publish your book will think about whether your book is good and if you are a good writer. They will also think about how easy it will be to sell your book.

Advertising is a tough business. In the early 1990s, it was especially difficult. Many companies were struggling financially, and this made it hard for advertising agencies to do their jobs. People who work in advertising felt under a lot of pressure. They had to come up with good ideas for advertisements with smaller budgets. They also had to work closely with their bosses and colleagues to make sure the advertisements were successful.
At the same time, companies were starting to realize the importance of marketing. They wanted to make sure they were producing products that people wanted to buy, not just things they could easily sell. This made marketing people more important, but it also added to their workload.
The economic situation was not the only challenge. There were other factors that made it difficult to create effective advertisements. For example, there were changes in the way people lived and shopped, and new rules about what could be advertised.
Many people in the advertising industry were struggling to make their advertisements work. They had to find new ways to do more with less. Some companies were successful, but they didn't always share their secrets. This meant that there was not much information available to help people who wanted to improve their advertising skills.

Summer is a great time to go on holiday and read books. We can escape from our daily routine and feel more connected to the world. Books help us understand that we are not alone in our thoughts and feelings. They can make us feel happy, sad, or excited, just like we do when we travel.
When we travel, we meet new people and see new things. Our eyes are open to the world in a way that we don't experience at home. We notice the little things, like the colors of the sky, the way people smile, or the beauty of nature. Reading a great book can have a similar effect. It can make us see the world in a new way and help us understand things we didn't notice before.

Music in the Future
Music is an important part of our lives. We can listen to music on the radio, TV, and on our phones. We can also play music ourselves. In the past, people used to listen to music more often, but now they don't listen as much. This is because we have many ways to listen to music now.
Music is important for many reasons. It makes us happy, and it helps us to express ourselves. We can listen to music with our friends and family, or we can play music with a group. Music is a big part of our culture and society.
Some people think that music will change in the future. They think that we will listen to different kinds of music and that we will use technology to make music. This means that we might not need to learn how to play an instrument as much. But, music is still important, and we will still need people who can play instruments.
To make music education better, we need to change the way we teach music. We need to make music education more accessible to everyone, not just to a few people who are good at music. We also need to teach people how to work together and how to communicate with each other.

Actors often get criticized. Sometimes they talk about their work in interviews and say silly things. But it's hard to talk about acting without giving away secrets. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, said that an actor's work is only interesting when they do it. Talking about it makes it boring. 
A good actor starts from scratch with each new play. They learn and grow with the characters and the writer. When the play is over, they feel empty until the next one. 
Adrian Lester played Hamlet well. He was good at controlling his emotions and using his voice. He made the audience feel like he was a real person. 
Acting is about bringing characters to life. It's not just about imitating them. It's about finding the right emotions and movements. 
One director has a special way of rehearsing. They call it ""dropping in"". The actors sit quietly and listen to the script. When it's their turn to speak, they think about what it means and find the reason to say the words. 
The perfect theatre makes you feel like you're part of the performance. The staff should feel like they're part of it too. The theatre should be designed so that the audience can feel connected to the performers.

**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website warned people about sharing their location online. The website said that even if you think you're just telling your friends where you are, you're also telling many other people, not all of whom you might want to meet. This shows that there can be a downside to sharing everything online.
We love sharing our lives on the internet. We can share our thoughts, photos, and stories with anyone in the world. But sometimes we forget that our online life is connected to our real life. What we say online can affect our real life, sometimes in bad ways.
A long time ago, some brave people started sharing their lives online. They were the first bloggers. They wrote about their lives, good and bad, and shared photos and art. They showed us that it's possible to be honest and open online.
One blogger, Justin Hall, started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his thoughts, feelings, and experiences. He even shared photos and art. People loved reading about him, but sometimes his honesty got him into trouble.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, wrote about her job and her life. But one day, her boss found out about her blog and she lost her job. This happened because people often feel like they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person. But our online life is connected to our real life, and what we say online can affect our real life.
Heather learned an important lesson. She realized that just because we can share anything online doesn't mean we should. She started writing about her new family and became a successful blogger. She learned to be careful about what she shares online.
We can learn from Heather's story. We should be careful about what we share online and think about how it might affect our real life."

Here is a simplified version of the reading passage for an A2 level learner:
Sleep is a big problem for many people. In the past, people didn't get enough sleep because they had to work long hours. Now, with more free time, people have more time to sleep, but many still don't get enough. In fact, research shows that 40 million Americans have trouble sleeping.
Some scientists are studying sleep to find out why we need it. They think that sleep helps our bodies repair themselves and helps us think clearly. They also think that women sleep for longer than men and that older people need less sleep.
But what is sleep for? Some scientists think that sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt. Others think that sleep is just a way to rest our bodies and minds.
In the past, people slept differently. They would sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. This was because they had to work during the day and didn't have much time to sleep. Now, most people sleep all night and wake up in the morning.
Some cultures still sleep differently. In some places, people go to bed for a few hours and then wake up to watch the fire or protect themselves from animals. In other places, people don't have a fixed bedtime and sleep when they feel tired.
Overall, sleep is important for our bodies and minds. We need to make sure we get enough sleep to stay healthy and happy."

I wore big, expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wanted to be a cowboy, but I wasn't. I didn't know how to be one. I looked at the mountains and felt out of place. I used to be a racing driver, but I don't do it anymore. I'm not sure what to do now. I thought about being a commentator at a racing event, but that didn't work out. I also thought about selling old cars, but nobody was buying them. Being an ""ex""-anything is hard. People don't want to hear about my old racing days. I miss driving fast cars and being famous. But now, I have a lot of free time. I looked up at the sky and saw some birds in a cactus. They were telling me to leave them alone. I realized that I have a lot to learn about being a cowboy.

Vancouver is a city in western Canada that has become popular with people from all over the world. Many people come to Vancouver because it has a good climate, a beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, and a safe and clean environment. It's also a great place to find a job and go to school.
The city has changed a lot in the past ten years. Many new buildings have been built, and this has made the city more lively and exciting. People from different countries come to Vancouver, and you can hear many different languages being spoken on the streets.
Some people used to call Vancouver ""Terminal City"" because it was a big stopover for people traveling to other places. Although this name is not used as much anymore, Vancouver is still a popular place for people to pass through.
Journalists often have trouble writing letters. This is because they are used to writing articles that need to be edited and rewritten. They are not used to writing letters that are not meant to be published.
When a famous artist writes something, they don't usually think about how it will be received. They just write from the heart. This is what makes their work special.
In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. Famous people would come to cut the ribbon. But now, supermarkets are opening all the time, and famous people are not needed. Last week, a new supermarket called Superbuy opened, and the first five people to enter the store got a prize. This made the people who got there early feel happy and proud, and the people who arrived later felt a little jealous."

Here is a simplified version of the passage for an A2 learner:
""Citizen Kane"" is a famous film that came out in 1941. When it was first released, it got a lot of attention, but it wasn't a big commercial success. It wasn't until television came along that people started talking about it again. This film is special because it inspired many people to become filmmakers. It's amazing because it was Orson Welles's first film! Welles said that he didn't know what he was allowed to do or not do, so he just went ahead and made the film. He had a great team working with him, including a camera man, a screenwriter, and a special effects expert.
The story is about a newspaper owner who is similar to a famous man named William Randolph Hearst. Welles thought this was a great idea because he could play the main character and direct the film at the same time. He was very excited to make this film.
There is also a story about a man named Dermot and his wife Carmel. They are talking about what Dermot might do that day. Carmel is going to go shopping and Dermot might be late because he wants to talk to someone at the golf club.
Now, there is a study that says job titles can cause problems at work. Many people are jealous of their colleagues' job titles. Some people would rather have a better job title than a pay rise. This shows that people are very concerned about their status at work.

I went to Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. They are a big part of my life. I like how light falls on things and how one picture can show what a place or person is like. One day, I might take the perfect picture. I always have a camera with me, so I can take a picture at any moment.
I used to take pictures for a living. But then something special happened. One of my pictures became very famous, and people all over the world wanted to use it. It was just luck, but people say you make your own luck.
After that, I started working on my own. I took pictures of cities in different seasons. One of my favorite projects was ""Four Cities in Four Seasons"" - London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I took pictures of London in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I also took pictures of Vienna, but the person who was supposed to take the pictures in Vienna didn't show up. So, I got the job instead.
I was happy to go to Vienna because things weren't going well at home. I stayed at a hotel in the old city and started taking pictures. The first day, I just walked around and got a feel for the city. The weather was cold and grey, like the old buildings. I didn't take any pictures that day.
The next morning, I went out early to take pictures of Stephansplatz. The snow had fallen overnight, and the square was quiet and white. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to do. It's a big building, and I couldn't fit it all in one picture. But it was still beautiful, and I was happy to be there.
I love taking pictures because it's like magic. You can make something special happen with a camera and some film. It's like watching a blank piece of paper turn into a picture. It's a mystery, and it's something that never gets old."

""London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a magical place. Not by a big, expensive, and flashy show, but by an interesting exhibition about a special kind of art called kinetic art. Kinetic art is about movement. The exhibition shows how many artists have made artworks that move or think about movement over the past 60 years. It's a surprise to see how many famous artists have worked on this theme.
The exhibition doesn't have many words to explain the art. Visitors can look at the paintings, drawings, and videos and make their own connections and discoveries. This way, people can enjoy the art without someone telling them what it means.
Some people like the art of David Hockney because it's easy to understand and looks like something they know. Others might like him because he's a famous person and writes interesting things in the newspapers. But does this mean his art is not important? Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist, but he knows he's not perfect and doesn't care.
I recently saw many art exhibitions and noticed that some shows try to tell us what to think. This can be good or bad. Sometimes it helps us understand new ideas, but sometimes it feels forced. So, I decided to create an exhibition that is the opposite. I worked with seven artists to create a show where each artist did their own thing, without any theme or idea in mind. The result was a fun and interesting show that people could enjoy without needing to understand a big concept.
Some people think that art is just about looking at something and enjoying it. Others think that understanding the art is important. But both are true. We can enjoy art without knowing all about it, but knowing more can make it even more enjoyable. What we find pleasing in art can also change over time and is influenced by the society we live in.""

Metals
A long time ago, people might have started to use metals because they liked the way they looked. Imagine someone sitting by a river, waiting for fish to come close. They might have picked up a shiny yellow stone and thought it was pretty. This is how people might have discovered gold. Because gold is soft, people soon wanted to use it a lot.
Copper might have been found by accident too. When people found out how useful copper tools were, they started to look for more copper and find ways to get it out of the ground. This is how people started to work with metals.
St Ives
We walked down a narrow street in St Ives, trying to stay away from the strong wind and the big waves on the beach. There were no people around, and all the houses had their shutters closed. We had taken a small train to get there and saw the weather getting worse. I had promised my friend that we would have nice walks and cozy evenings by the fire. But now, visiting without a car didn't seem like such a good idea.
Computer Modelling
It's hard to learn about the past because it's already happened. The people who lived a long time ago are gone, and we can't ask them questions. Archaeologists find clues, but we can't test our ideas by doing experiments on people who are already dead. We can't rewind time and watch what happened again. But maybe we can. With computers, we can create virtual worlds and put virtual people in them. We can make rules for how they live and see how they react when things change.

**Vervet Monkeys**
One day, a strange male monkey came to a group of vervet monkeys. The dominant male was worried that the stranger might join the group and take his place. So, he came up with a clever idea. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the dominant male made a loud noise, like the sound a leopard makes. The stranger got scared and went back to his own group.
This happened several times, and the stranger got tired of trying to join the group. But then, the dominant male made a mistake. He made the leopard noise while walking across the open ground. The stranger thought it was really a leopard and ran away. The dominant male was safe again.
**Cats and Birds**
In a small village in England, people collected their cats' catches over a year. They found that 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor thought this meant that all the cats in Britain catch 100 million animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and don't catch as many animals as the cats in the village. The important question is: are the cats' catches harming the bird population? The answer is no. Many people feed birds, and there are many places for them to live, so the bird population is okay.
**Buffaloes**
Buffaloes are very important to the people who take care of them. They sleep near the fire or on a platform. In the morning, they slowly get up and go to the reeds by the water. They spend the day eating and resting. They are very slow and quiet, and it's hard to notice them.
**Picasso's Painting**
Pablo Picasso was an artist who liked to paint what he saw around him. He painted a picture of a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some fish. The fish look like they are still alive. The painting is special because Picasso used a special way of painting, with thin brushstrokes and cool colors. It looks like an underwater world, but there is also a sense of danger and tension. The fish and crab look like they might fight."

Here is a simplified version of the passage for an A2 level learner:
Photography has been around for over 150 years. During this time, it has helped us record many things about human life and the world. Photography has improved a lot, allowing us to see things that are very small or very far away. It has also shown us the beauty of nature, the struggles of people, and the problems of the world.
People have always used pictures to tell stories and remember important events. The earliest pictures were made over 35,000 years ago. These pictures were found in caves and were probably used to tell stories about hunting and daily life.
When photography was invented, it was seen as a way to capture reality. People thought that photographs were a true representation of what they saw. This made photography very important and influential.
Some people thought that photography was a universal language, meaning that anyone could understand a picture, no matter where they came from. However, this is not always true. Photography can be influenced by culture and can be understood differently by different people.
Over time, photography has changed and evolved. It is no longer just a way to record memories, but also a way to tell stories and bring about change. Photography has helped shape our culture and has shown us the importance of social and political issues.
For example, the development of perspective in art helped change the way people saw the world during the Italian Renaissance. Similarly, photography has played a big role in shaping our media culture today."

Writing Poetry
Writing poetry is like taking a walk in a field. You need to be careful not to step on any hidden stones. Some people like to write poetry without thinking too much, while others like to plan it out. Both ways are okay, as long as you don't copy someone else's style.
The most important thing is to find your own way of writing. Listen to your own voice and let it speak. Don't worry too much about what others think. With time, your writing will grow stronger and more confident.
Short Stories
When writing a short story, it's important to keep it simple. Don't try to put too many characters or long stories in it. Use flashbacks only if they help to explain something. You can also use dialogue to show different points of view.
The key is to make every word count. You need to be careful with your words, like a chef with ingredients. You can't just throw everything in, or it will be too much.
Screenplays
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves. But, like chess, you don't know exactly what will happen next. You just need to keep moving and see what happens.
The more you write, the better you will become at it. You'll start to see patterns and understand how to make it work.
Writing
Writing is like speaking, but not everyone can do it. We all have an instinct to speak, but writing is something we need to learn. It's like a special tool that we need to use.
We need to understand how writing works and how our brains work to make it work. It's not easy, but with practice, we can get better at it.

I'm writing a book about a person I knew, but I'm not sure what to call it. It's not a big story, and it doesn't have a happy ending or a wedding. I just want to write down what I remember about this person.
I've changed the names of the people in the story to protect them, and I've tried to make it clear that it's not a famous person. Maybe no one will ever know who this person was. But maybe, long after they're gone, people will read my book and learn about their life.
I didn't keep notes of our conversations, but I have a good memory. I've written down what I think we said, but it's not word for word. I've also added some things that I didn't hear, but that might make the story more interesting.
I'm worried about writing about someone from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone who is from a different place. They are shaped by their home, their family, and their friends. You can't know all of that just by talking to them. You have to live it yourself.
I've never written about someone from another country before, so I'm a bit nervous. But I think it's okay to try. I'll just write what I know, and you can use your imagination to fill in the rest.

POETRY RECITALS
At any time in history, the world of poetry can seem confusing. But looking back, we can see that some poets are more famous than others. Today, there are many different kinds of poetry and many ways to perform it. Some poets write for the page, while others prefer to read their work aloud.
Some people think that the two groups are very different. The ""literary"" poets write for an audience that reads their work on paper. The ""popular"" poets like to perform their work in front of a live audience. But this is not always true. Many small groups and schools invite poets to read their work. Some festivals even have poetry readings.
This has some good and bad effects. For the ""pop"" poets, performing live is the best way to share their work. Their poetry is often simple and easy to understand. But for poets who care about their craft, it can be hard to connect with an audience that may not understand their work.
Attending a poetry reading can be fun and helpful, but it's not the same as reading poetry on the page. It's good to have the text in front of you or know the poems beforehand. The main reason for popular poetry readings is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for a special group of people.

**Oral History**
When historians talk to people to learn about the past, they have to be careful. The person telling the story might not always tell the truth because they are influenced by the historian asking the questions. The historian's questions and the way they ask them can also affect what the person says. Even the person telling the story might not remember things correctly because they have learned things from others or have strong feelings about the past.
**Animal Science**
There are two ways to study animals: by looking at how their bodies work and by studying how they behave in their natural environment. Some scientists study how animals behave in a lab, while others study animals in their natural habitats. Both ways are important because they help us understand animals better.
**The Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you have to do two things at the same time: learn about the subject and learn how to study it. Social sciences are not just about common sense; they use special methods and ideas to understand people and society.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was an art that included things like order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and propriety. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that architecture was important for its beauty and artistic value, not just for its function. The history of classical architecture is complex, and it has roots in simple, early buildings that were not very artistic."

I was dazed, scared, and relieved. I was also angry at you for not letting me down and afraid of what my parents would say.
You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I tried to answer, but you called again, and I stopped talking. I lay there, looking at you through my eyelashes. You left and called for help. I waited a bit, then pulled myself up and got out of the well.
I heard my parents and you coming. I ran away and hid in the shadows. My mother was very upset, and my father told Arthur to pull me up. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows, feeling happy and scared at the same time.
I looked at the spots of water on the ground and saw that nobody had seen them. My mother was screaming loudly, and I felt guilty. I didn't know what to do. I had gotten myself into trouble.
I came out of my hiding place, crying and holding my head. I yelled for help, but nobody came. I stumbled a bit and fell down. My mother came to me and held me. I said I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled and swam through it to get out. But my father didn't believe me.
He asked me to tell him again, and I said the tunnel fell down after me. He looked at me with a serious face and said I was lying. I felt bad, and my father walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad face, shaking his head. He was disappointed in me for lying.

The house is a beautiful four-story building with a tiny harbour view. She has many happy memories of her children growing up there. 
Her son Robert, who is now a grown man, is helping with the move. He reminds her of when they first bought the house and he asked how they would get it home. Susan's daughter Francesca is also helping, but she's being a bit bossy. The removal man, Fred, says that people often cry when they're moving because it's hard to leave their old home.

The Internet makes it easy for people to share their opinions about books. Amazon, a big online bookshop, lets anyone write a review about a book. This is a good thing because it helps people decide if they want to buy a book or not. However, it also means that some people might write fake reviews. Some authors even wrote fake reviews about their own books to make them look better.
Amazon has rules to stop this from happening. They don't allow reviews that are too short or too mean. But it's hard for them to check all the reviews, so sometimes fake ones get through. Some authors even wrote fake reviews about other books to make them look bad.
Despite this, most people who write reviews are serious and honest. They help others decide if a book is good or not. This is a good thing because it helps people find books they will enjoy. The writer George Orwell thought that writing reviews was hard because you have to think about what you really think about a book. But with Amazon, anyone can share their opinion.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, adapted for an A2 level learner:
Art has changed a lot over the past two hundred years. People used to think that artists had to be different and special to create good art. We like to admire artists who were ahead of their time and did something new and exciting. But when it comes to art from our own time, we often don't understand it and think it's not good art. The media can also influence our opinions, and we often agree with what they say.
We expect artists to be special and talented, and we think they should create something new and exciting. In the past, people would commission artists to create art for specific purposes, like a portrait or a decoration. But now, artists are more free to create whatever they want, and we often get upset if they don't follow the rules.
Let me tell you about a strange situation. An artist chose a text from an art book that talks about different kinds of pictures. The text says that there are many different kinds of pictures, and the artist likes this idea. The artist then asks someone else to paint a canvas with the text on it, but the artist doesn't want the text to be fancy or decorative. The question is: is this a painting?
Some artists have a hard time trying new things and creating different kinds of art. People expect them to keep doing what they're good at, and they get upset if they try something new. But some artists are brave and try new things, like Picasso and Hockney.
One artist, Eric Rimmington, is doing something new and exciting. He's painting pictures of the London Underground, which is a unique and interesting place. He's been drawing pictures of the Underground for a long time, and now he's showing his work in an exhibition.
I'd like to share a passage from a novel with you. The main character has escaped to a remote island and is trying to heal. He's alone except for a villager who comes to clean the house.

Art can help us find meaning and solace in our lives, even when things are difficult.

Simon Costello knew that buying a house in Pembroke Square was a mistake. They had moved in a year ago, and it was too expensive. They had to be very careful with their money. At the time, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had a lot of successful cases, and his wife Lois was back to work at her advertising job after having twins. She got a raise and now earned £35,000 a year.
Lois wanted to move because their flat was not suitable for a family. They needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for their au pair. They could have found a bigger place in a suburb or a less expensive part of London, but Lois wanted something better. She wanted to live in a nice area, like Mornington Mansions.
Lois thought that one of them should take the bus to work instead of the tube. Simon's office is on the other side of London, so he would have to take the bus. The long bus ride made Simon think about all the things that were bothering him. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he felt happy and relaxed.
Simon's wife Lois was ambitious and wanted to succeed in her career. She and Simon agreed that their careers were important. They needed two salaries to live the way they did. Now, their whole life could be ruined by someone named Venetia.
Venetia came to their office and was very angry. She said some things that upset Simon.

Writing Reviews: A Practitioner's View
Frank Kermode talks about the art of writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and have a short life. They are often short, and readers only read them for a short time. People think that reviews are not important because they are temporary. However, writing reviews is a skill that requires a lot of knowledge and good writing skills.
A good reviewer needs to think about who they are writing for. They might write for people who just want to get a quick idea of a book, or for people who want to learn more. The reviewer also needs to know a lot about different subjects and write in a way that is easy to understand.
Some reviewers, like the American author John Updike, write reviews in their free time. They might not want their reviews to disappear, so they collect them and publish them in books. Other reviewers, like professors, might write reviews as part of their job. This is good because it helps readers understand what they are reading, and it reminds professors to write clearly and simply.
In the end, writing reviews is not the main job of a reviewer. They need to be doing something else well, like writing a novel or teaching."

Ralph came home to his flat, feeling a mix of emotions. When he first bought the flat, he was excited to come home and see what had happened during the day. He used to come home early, eager to see if anything had changed. The flat was his own space, where he could relax and be himself. Over time, he started to see the flat as a part of himself, like an extension of his own home.
Sometimes, he would find a pile of letters by the door and the answering machine would be blinking. He was grateful that the windows weren't broken and the flat wasn't messy. Ralph looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the busy office. He would sit alone, surrounded by his things, and feel a sense of relief.
But as the night went on, he would start to feel lonely and empty. He would read or listen to music, but even those things didn't seem to bring him joy anymore. He felt lost and unsure of who he was or what he wanted. He had once had a plan for his life, but it didn't seem to be working out.
Ralph had applied for a job at a local newspaper and got it. He thought it was a good opportunity, but now he wasn't so sure. He was stuck in a job that didn't make him happy, and he didn't know how to change it.

I'm going to tell you about three different things I experienced.
First, I went to a place called Buccoo Village on Easter Monday. There was a goat racing competition. I had to push my way through a lot of people, food stalls, and loud music to get a good spot to watch. The goats were running on a special track, and it was hard to keep them in order because they like to eat anything they can find.
After the goat racing, I went on a canoe trip with my friend Lesley. We were worried because the canoe was wet, we didn't know where to sleep, and we hadn't seen any villages or houses since morning. We used a flashlight to see where we were going, but the batteries were running out. We couldn't find a place to camp.
Later, Lesley saw a light in the distance, and we thought it might be a village. But it was just the moon shining on the water. We heard the sound of fast-moving water, but we couldn't see what was happening. We kept moving.
The third thing I want to tell you about is how to make a good presentation. I'm not good at making presentations, but my job requires me to do it sometimes. To make a good presentation, you need to be confident and convinced about what you're saying. You should do your homework and practice what you're going to say. Ask your colleagues for help and try to think about the questions they might ask. Start your presentation by talking about something everyone can agree on, and then build up to your main point."

There are some things that cannot be rushed. For example, if you mix mayonnaise too quickly, it will curdle. If you try to force a knot in a fishing line, it will get tighter. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can speed up some tasks, like solving a puzzle or doing math in our heads. But other tasks need time and cannot be rushed.
Some people think that we should always think quickly and make decisions fast. But this is not always the best approach. We need to think slowly and carefully in some situations. This is especially true when we are trying to understand something complex or make a big decision.
Our minds have three different ways of thinking. One is fast and automatic, like when we react to a sudden situation. Another is slower and more thoughtful, like when we solve a problem or make a decision. The third is slower and more relaxed, like when we daydream or think deeply about something.
This slower way of thinking is important because it helps us come up with new ideas and find creative solutions. It's like being a poet or a philosopher, who often think deeply and slowly to come up with new ideas.
Recently, scientists have discovered that our slower way of thinking can also help us learn and understand things that are difficult to grasp. They call this ""cognitive science."" It's like giving our minds permission to wander and explore new ideas, which can lead to new discoveries and insights.

I am in a special place where I live with other people who are scientists, students, and weather forecasters. It's a friendly and comfortable place, but it's also very far from other people. I can communicate with them using my school French, but it's not easy to have a conversation. I miss being able to talk freely and use idioms.
I was worried about eating with the others because I didn't know what to do. I was afraid of making mistakes and being silent. But I'm not the only one who feels this way. I think I'm just missing my usual confidence because I'm not used to not being the center of attention.
I met a man named Elliot who didn't notice me at first, but later he became friendly and we started talking more often. He liked my work as a writer and wanted to know me better.
There was another man named Alfred Hitchcock who was a famous film director. He believed that the most important thing in a movie is not the story or the acting, but the way it looks and sounds. He thought that people can be moved by a movie, no matter where they come from. He was very good at making movies that people loved, and he liked to see people get scared.

'Astronomy has changed a lot in the past 50 years. Until 30 years ago, there were not many books or tools for amateur astronomers. Now, you can buy many different telescopes and tools easily. Computers and calculators have made it easier to study the stars and share our findings. This should make it a great time for amateur astronomy. But, many things have changed for the worse too. It's harder to find a clear sky because of airplanes and clouds. This makes it hard to see the stars at night.
Now, we have too many choices in life. We have many things to do and buy, and it's hard to make decisions. We're always looking for something new and exciting. But, having too many choices can be stressful and make our lives more complicated. Some people are looking for simpler things in life.

Scientists
I heard an interesting talk on the radio about scientists and why they do their work. Some scientists are asking why we want to learn more about the world and why we can't just be happy with what we know. I think it's more important to focus on what we're doing and how we can use our knowledge to make the world a better place.'

Food is an important part of our lives. We enjoy eating and cooking because it makes us feel happy and satisfied. We don't need to make complicated dishes to be happy. Simple food, like a soup made with carrots, leek, and celery, can be delicious. We can also make sweet treats, like chocolate mousse, without using preservatives and additives.
Cooking is a way to show love and care for others. When we cook for someone, we are saying that we care about them. Sharing food with others is a special way to connect with them.

Joanna MacGregor is a famous pianist who plays the piano very well. She also writes books for children who want to learn how to play the piano. Many people are surprised that she writes books because she is very busy with her concerts and other work. But Joanna thinks that it's very important for children to learn how to play the piano from the very beginning.
Joanna used to teach piano to children when she was younger. She saw that some children loved playing the piano, while others gave up because it was too hard. She wants to help children enjoy playing the piano, even if they are not very good at it. She thinks that everyone should be able to play the piano a little bit, just like everyone should be able to swim or speak a little French.
Joanna's new book, ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"", is special because it has stories and fun music to help children learn. She wants children to enjoy playing the piano and not get frustrated. She also wants parents to remember that it's okay if their children don't become professional pianists. The most important thing is for children to have fun playing the piano.
Joanna thinks that practice is very important. She used to practice for a long time every day when she was learning to play the piano. She says that it's important to set goals and practice regularly, even if it's just for a short time each day. She also thinks that it's important to make mistakes and not be too hard on yourself.
Overall, Joanna wants to help children enjoy playing the piano and make it fun for them. She hopes that her book will help children learn to play the piano and have fun doing it."

Dr. Johnson said that writing takes effort. If you don't put effort into writing, you won't enjoy reading it. Good writing is hard to do. When I look back at my old school essays, I see that I didn't make many mistakes. This is because writing by hand is slow and makes you think carefully. If you make a mistake, it's hard to correct. With computers, it's easy to write and correct, but it's also easy to make mistakes.
People often send emails and text messages, but they don't take the time to think about what they're writing. This can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings. On the other hand, handwritten letters are special and take more effort. This makes them more meaningful.

Breakfast in England: A New Tradition
Experts say that breakfast is very important for our health. But in the past, breakfast was not a common meal in England. In medieval times, people didn't often eat breakfast. Only kings and nobles ate breakfast. 
However, this changed in the 1500s. More people started eating breakfast. Some people think this was because there was more food available. But others think that other big changes in society also played a role. For example, as people started working at set times, they needed to eat breakfast to give them energy for their jobs. This was especially important because many people had to start work very early in the morning. So, eating breakfast became a necessity, not just a luxury for the rich."

Photography When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show and how to show it. This is based on their skills, what they think is important, and what others think is important too. In this book, we will see how these things affect the pictures and how people react to them. For example, when we look at a picture in a newspaper, we might wonder if it really shows what happened or if it's just what the photographer wanted us to see.

Birds have been important in human culture for a long time. People have loved, feared, and worshiped them. But what does this say about us? 
In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in could predict their luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British culture. We often see pictures and ceramics of wrens in our homes. This shows that wrens have a special place in our hearts.
People have always been fascinated by birds. In the past, people relied on nature for their survival, so they developed a special language to understand the world around them. This language helped them communicate the importance of other creatures. 
For example, the red kite was once a common sight in London, where people would feed it bread. But later, people started to see it as a pest, and it almost disappeared. Now, it's a symbol of conservation and is being reintroduced.
Our relationship with birds is not just cultural. It's also part of our human nature. We're fascinated by birds because they can fly, sing, and are free. This is a reflection of our own desires and aspirations.
Some people might think that our feelings about birds are just old habits that are no longer important. But they're still a part of us. That's why birds are now seen as indicators of environmental change.
Birds carry a lot of cultural significance. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are symbols of love, romance, and magic. Losing these birds is not just a loss for nature, but also a loss for our culture.
Folklore is important because it helps us connect with the natural world and understand its significance. The stories and legends we tell about birds are a way of interpreting what they're trying to tell us. The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of the connection between the present and the past, and the importance of preserving our relationship with nature."

Maps are used to show the relationships between places and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, like ""a day's journey"" or ""a few hours' walk"". However, this method didn't give accurate information about the actual distance.
Direction is also important, but for most people, knowing ""where am I going?"" and ""how far is it?"" is more important than knowing the exact direction. That's why written itineraries were often used instead of maps.
On maps, important landmarks are shown, and their size can indicate their importance. The way maps are made can vary depending on the purpose and the place. To understand old maps, it's essential to know the conventions used.
The history of map-making is about making these elements of distance and direction more accurate and including more information on maps. Cartographers have used other sciences, like astronomy and magnetism, to improve their work.
Maps have become more accurate and detailed over time. They are now used by many people, including soldiers, archaeologists, and geographers, each with their own needs. To meet these needs, cartographers have developed new methods for mapping different things, like climate and land use.
Today, we recognize the importance of maps in many sciences, which has led to a ""renaissance"" in cartography. However, it's essential to be critical when looking at old maps and to remember that they are a record of the past.

I visited Andrew Lloyd Webber's home, a cozy room filled with nice things. His family had other rooms that were a bit messy. Andrew was a talented musician who had won a scholarship to study at Oxford University. He wanted to be a famous composer, just like Richard Rodgers. I had similar dreams, but my goals were not as important to me. Andrew asked me to help him write a musical about a kind man named Dr. Barnardo who helped orphans. I agreed because Andrew was very talented and had a good idea. He showed me some of his songs and I liked them. We decided to work together and write a musical. I was excited to write the words for the songs. Andrew gave me some ideas and I came up with some lyrics. I even skipped a day of work to write more lyrics.

Language
We humans have a special ability to use language to communicate with each other. We can talk to each other with great precision. Language is an important part of our daily lives. We use it to talk to each other, even when we're alone. Sometimes we talk to ourselves, our pets, or even plants!
I think of language as an instinct, like how spiders spin webs. We don't need to learn how to talk, it just comes naturally to us.
Climate and Weather
The weather and climate have a big impact on the world around us. The air around us affects the lives of animals and plants. Different climates can make different landscapes. For example, warm and wet weather creates tropical jungles with many different kinds of plants and animals. Cold and windy areas have fewer living things.
The weather is always changing because of the movement of air. The air is not still, and it moves because of the sun's heat.

Why do TV shows about art often fail? Painting and sculpture should be easy to show on TV because the camera can zoom in and out to show details. But few TV shows can make art enjoyable and interesting. One example of a show that didn't work is ""American Visions"" by Robert Hughes. He is a well-known art critic, but his show was not about great works of art. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are reflected in its art and buildings.

Some American managers are using Shackleton as an example of a good leader. They think he was a great communicator and a brave person who made tough decisions. Shackleton was a good leader because he had a clear plan, was honest with his team, and was willing to listen to others.
Shackleton's story is being told through books, films, and exhibitions. One manager, Jim MacGregor, thinks Shackleton's leadership skills are very useful for modern business. He says Shackleton was good at communicating with his team, even in difficult times. Shackleton's team was stuck in the ice for nine months, but he kept them safe and motivated.

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special primate called the aye-aye. It eats insects that live inside wood, just like woodpeckers. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes in the wood and its long finger to find the insects. Scientists have been studying how the aye-aye finds its food. They wanted to know if it uses its eyes, nose, or ears to find the insects. They did some experiments and found that the aye-aye can't see, smell, or hear the insects. So, how does it find them? The scientists think that the aye-aye taps the wood with its finger and listens for the sound of the hollow space inside. It might also hear the insects moving when it taps the wood. The aye-aye is special because it can do things that woodpeckers do, like eating insects from wood. It's also like a squirrel because its teeth grow continuously and it eats nuts.

Most people have pictures of their grandparents, but few know what their lives were like when they were young. We often want to write down our memories, but we never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a solution. She writes books about ordinary people's lives. Each book is at least 20,000 words long and has pictures. She talks to people from her family and friends and writes down their stories.
Hannah realized that many people didn't want to talk about their past because they were worried about what others would think. So, she promised them that their stories would be kept secret. This made them feel comfortable and honest. One man she wrote about was 62 years old and had made and lost a lot of money. He was surprised by what he remembered. He talked about his divorce and the pain it still caused him.
Hannah found that many people's childhoods had a big impact on their lives. They often repeated the same mistakes or made the same choices as their parents. She also found that people still regretted or resented things that happened to them when they were young, even when they were old.
Hannah doesn't ask too many questions. She just listens and writes down what people tell her. She helps them make sense of their lives and stories. She thinks that people want to remember their past and leave a legacy for their families. She uses modern technology to make the books look nice and professional.
The books are expensive, but the people who buy them are happy with the result. Hannah gets many requests, but she can't make the books cheap because it takes a lot of time. She thinks that people who are interested in their family history will pay for a good-quality book.

E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is a unique tourist attraction. You can create your own wall hanging by rubbing brass plates from medieval tombs. The centre has over 100 different plates to choose from. By making resin copies, we can preserve the originals and still let people enjoy rubbing the brass. This was a common way to remember people in medieval times. Most of the brass plates were destroyed, but we have many remaining ones in Britain, and you can see the best examples at the Cambridge Centre."

I. The theatre director
I have been a father for 35 years and I love every minute of it. I've been lucky to have such great kids. We all like the same things, like opera, theatre, books, and music. This has made us close, especially now that they're grown up and I'm more like a friend to them. I'm not perfect, but I've always tried to be there for them.
II. The advertising executive
I became a father when I was young, and it changed my life. I had to grow up quickly, but it also kept me young. My kids introduced me to new things, like music and fashion, which helped me in my work. I missed some special moments, like school events, but I've made up for it by taking them on holidays.
III. The politician
I became a father when I was busy with my job, but I made sure to spend time with my kids. I only accept meetings on weekends if they can come with me. This way, they know what I do and don't feel left out.
IV. The writer
I became a father after my first marriage ended. I made an effort to stay close to my kids, but I think I was too lenient with them. I regret that now. I still worry about my kids, even when they're grown up.
V. The TV presenter
I always wanted to have kids. Having my daughter has made me realize who I am and what I want. Being a parent is a big responsibility, but it's also very special. Seeing my daughter smile makes all my worries go away.

A special plane took 13 students on a very unusual flight. The plane was an old Boeing KC-135, but it was modified to make it look like a long, white tunnel. There were no windows, but it was bright inside. The students were excited because they had won a competition to be part of this special flight. They had to come up with ideas for experiments to do in weightless conditions.
The plane flew up, up, up, and then down, down, down. This made the students feel weightless for a few seconds. During this time, they could move around freely and do their experiments. Some students studied how cats move in space, while others looked at how metal joins work in zero gravity. Another group tried to make special sails that could use the sun's rays to move.
The flight was over after two hours. The students felt happy and excited. They had never experienced anything like this before. One student said, ""I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want to even more."""

I had a special time in my life when I didn't have a summer for nine years. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is their winter. My parents wanted to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. They said, ""If you can take the time and effort to plant trees, you can have it."" The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, because my father grew up there.
I was very excited to plant trees. I had worked on farms in Australia before, so I knew it would be hard work. But I liked it. My family and I planted the 70 acres of land over four years. It was a lot of work, especially because it rained a lot. But it was also very happy times. We would get ready for the next planting session every morning, getting wet and cold. It was a special feeling.
I had a friend who helped me plant trees, which was very helpful because I had never done it before. We would fill our bags with as many trees as we could and then plant them along a line. It was hard to get the lines straight, but once we did, it was easy. I enjoyed the physical work and got very fit.
As I planted trees, I started to think about the natural world and our place in it. This thinking has continued to influence my life. I've gone back to New Zealand four times to see how the trees are growing, and it's been very satisfying. I'm proud of what we accomplished.
Sometimes I worry about the news stories about bad weather in New Zealand, but so far, the trees are doing well. I even wrote a book about my experience, called Seeing Green. I spent three months on the tree farm, writing in the mornings, pruning trees in the afternoons, and doing research in the evenings. The connection I have with that place is very strong. It's a special bond between people and the earth."

**Taking Care of Baby Badgers**
My husband and I run a farm in Somerset where we take care of orphaned animals. One day, some helpers brought us three baby badgers. They were very small, about 8 inches long, and had soft, grey fur and white and black stripes on their heads. We had never seen baby badgers before, as they usually live underground and die if they are orphaned.
The mother badger had been killed, and the babies were cold and hungry. We fed them with a special bottle and kept them warm by the stove. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow. At first, we had to help them go to the bathroom by wiping them with a warm cloth, just like a mother badger would do. After a few days, they started eating and drinking on their own.
Willow, one of the cubs, got sick and died. We were very sad. But then, a local farmer brought us another baby badger, and we named him Willow II. He was a bit smaller and harder to feed than the others. It took some time, but eventually, he learned to eat solid food.
As the cubs grew, they started to play and explore. They loved to chase each other and play in the long grass. We would join in and play with them too. But we had to be careful not to get too close, or they would nip us.
As the summer got hotter and it was harder to find food, the cubs started to go out at night to hunt for worms and other insects. We would go with them and watch them play. They would curl up together in their new home, a special underground sett we built for them.
Now, the cubs are grown and have their own territory. We still see them sometimes, but they are mostly nocturnal, so we don't see them as often during the day. We are happy that we could give them a good home and help them grow up strong and healthy."

Dr. Toby Clark is a scientist who wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer. Halley is best known for a comet, but he also helped sailors by measuring how the compass works. He did this by sailing to different parts of the world and taking notes. This was very important because it helped sailors know where they were going.
Halley's work was very important, but it was also very difficult. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Rio de Janeiro, and even to the frozen land of Antarctica. He wrote a book about his findings, which helped sailors for many years.
Now, Dr. Clark wants to do the same thing. He wants to sail the same route that Halley took and measure the compass again. This will help us understand the Earth's magnetic field better. The Earth's magnetic field is always changing, so we need to update our knowledge.
Dr. Clark is a sailor and a scientist. He has already sailed a long way and has experience working in the Antarctic. He plans to sail with a team of people and use special instruments to measure the compass. He hopes to raise £70,000 to make this trip happen.
Dr. Clark is very excited about this project. He thinks that Halley's work is important and that he deserves to be remembered. He also hopes that his own journey will help us understand the Earth better.

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their beautiful tails to the hens. But how did they get such a fancy feature? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are trying to find out. They think that peacocks' tails might be a sign of good health or a good mate. A long time ago, a scientist named Charles Darwin thought that peacocks' tails were a waste of space. He believed that animals evolved to survive and reproduce, and that the ones with the best features would have more babies. But another scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that peacocks' tails might be important for something else. He believed that hens chose the males with the most impressive tails because they knew something that humans didn't.
To solve this mystery, Petrie and her team are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade. They want to know if hens really do prefer the males with the most impressive tails and if these males have any other good qualities. They have been watching the peacocks for a long time and taking pictures. They found that hens do like the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. But they still don't know if these males are also healthier or better in other ways.
One scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that showy birds are often healthier than others. Petrie and her team are trying to find out if this is true for peacocks. They are comparing the babies of the males that hens like with the babies of the males that hens don't like. If the babies of the liked males are healthier, then it means that hens are choosing the right males.
There is one more interesting idea. A mathematician named R A Fisher thought that maybe hens started liking the males with longer tails because they saw something good in them. The sons of these males would inherit their fathers' long tails, and the daughters would like long tails too. This would create a cycle where the males with the longest tails would have more babies, and the hens would keep liking them. This could be why peacocks have such long tails.

'MY DREAM BOAT
I think a good boat should combine old and new ideas. My boat, ""The Westerman"", is an example of this. It's not a new boat, but it looks like it's from another time. People might think I'm a romantic, but I'm not. This boat has the best of both worlds - old-fashioned design and modern technology.
Many modern boats have lots of new technology, but it can make sailing too easy. Sometimes, sailors forget what it's like to be at sea. My boat is different. It has a coal stove for warmth and a comfortable place to sleep. I like it that way.
I used to have another boat, Hirta, which was very comfortable, but not luxurious. She taught me that a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I had to stop sailing with Hirta because of an injury, I built a new boat, The Westerman. The designer, Nigel Irens, used a computer to help design it, but he also drew it on a napkin and made a model by hand.
The Westerman is a great boat. She's sailed across the Atlantic and has won many races. She looks old-fashioned, but she's very comfortable and peaceful inside. She's a reminder that sometimes, it's good to go back to old ways and listen to the lessons of the past.'

They also give you a special diet to follow. I felt a bit hungry at first, but the food was nice and healthy. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. The staff are very nice and the atmosphere is very relaxing.
**Careys Manor**
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it's a nice old manor house with a cozy lounge. The food is delicious, but if you're counting calories, you might want to eat in the main dining hall. They have a gym and a pool, so you can exercise to burn off the calories. They also have a spa bath, steam room, and treatment rooms. I got help for an old shoulder injury from a physiotherapist.
**Cliveden**
Cliveden is a big country house with lots of things to do. You can have health and beauty treatments, go for walks in the woods, and ride horses. The food is amazing, and the gym is very nice. I had a facial and an aromatherapy massage, and it was very relaxing. They also have a great restaurant with lots of delicious food.

We are very similar to chimpanzees, and we haven't changed much in the past seven million years. We are almost 98% identical to them. This means that any differences between humans and animals must be very recent. Scientists think that our ability to make art and other things that make us unique must come from a small number of genes.
But, surprisingly, animals are also able to do things that we thought were unique to humans. For example, chimpanzees use sticks to eat and to defend themselves, and sea otters use rocks to open shells. Some animals even have their own language, like monkeys who make different sounds to warn each other about dangers.
We used to think that art was something that only humans could do, but now we know that animals can create art too. For example, chimpanzees have been known to paint and make music. They do it for their own pleasure, not for a practical reason.
We used to think that human art was different because it is not useful, but animals also create art that is not useful. We also thought that human art was different because it is made for aesthetic pleasure, but animals may also enjoy the way their art looks or sounds. Finally, we thought that human art was different because it is learned, but animals can also learn to make art.
In fact, there is a famous story about two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy who created paintings that were shown in an art museum. People bought some of their paintings, and they were very good at making art.
So, it seems that the differences between human art and animal art are not as big as we thought. Both humans and animals can create art for pleasure, and both can learn to make art."

People sleep for about a third of their lives. It's clear that sleep is important, but what it's for is still a mystery. Scientists don't agree on why we sleep so much. There are three main ideas about this. One idea is that our body needs sleep to stay healthy. It's like our body is fixing any damage we did during the day while we sleep. Another idea is that sleep helps us learn new things. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to remember what we learned during the day. The third idea is that sleep helps us have energy for the next day. It's like our body is recharging its batteries while we sleep.
I made the following changes to simplify the text for an A2 learner:
* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary
* Removed complex phrases and sentences
* Used more concrete and relatable examples (e.g. ""fixing damage"" instead of ""repair any damage done during the day"")
* Reduced the use of abstract concepts (e.g. ""energy"" is now explained as ""recharging batteries"")
* Removed technical terms (e.g. ""biological processes"", ""efficient"") and replaced with simpler language"

What is an eccentric? An eccentric is someone who does things differently from what is normal. But what is normal? We all have our own quirks and things that make us unique. Maybe you like to collect stamps or write letters to the newspaper. Being eccentric is about being yourself and doing what you want, even if others don't understand.
Most of us have two sides to our personality. One side wants to fit in and be like everyone else, and the other side wants to be different and stand out. It's like two trains going in opposite directions. In most people, the side that wants to fit in is stronger. We all want to be accepted and liked by others.
People who are different often find each other and join groups or clubs to talk about their interests. They want to be with others who understand them. A crowd can be comforting, even if it's just a small group.
We all have a balance between being ourselves and fitting in. We might feel like we're being like everyone else, but deep down, we want to be different. We might even pretend to be different to feel special. But true eccentrics are not trying to be different, they just are.
For example, a famous singer like Bob Dylan is known for being himself and doing what he wants. He didn't try to be different, he just is. Real eccentrics are not trying to get attention or make a point, they just do what feels natural to them.
In contrast, some people do things to get attention or to rebel against society. They are aware of what others think and do things to make a statement. Eccentrics are not like this. They are not thinking about what others think, they just do what they want because it's who they are."

DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS? We asked five big book publishers in the UK about how book reviews affect the success of a book. Here's what they said.
Publisher A Reviews are very important for publishers. People often read reviews before buying a book. In fact, a survey found that many people choose a book because of a good review. Authors like reviews too, but they might not be as happy with a bad review. Publishers think that a mix of good and bad reviews can actually help sell more books.
Publisher B Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to sell books. Book reviews are better now than they used to be, but there's still a problem. Some books, especially paperbacks, don't get reviewed enough.
Publisher C Reviews are essential for publishers. Without them, we wouldn't know how to promote our books. Good reviews can help sell books, especially if they're written by well-known authors.
Publisher D The relationship between publishers and reviewers in the UK is complicated. In the US, one good review in a big newspaper can make or break a book. In the UK, it's harder to predict how well a book will sell.
Publisher E All publishers and authors want great reviews, but do they really help sell books? I once published a biography that got amazing reviews, but it didn't sell well. Some people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book.

In the beginning of the year, Nicholas Evans had a problem. A film project he was working on fell through. This was a big worry for him because he hadn't earned any money in two years. He could have gotten a job or started a new project, but instead, he decided to go to America for three months to research his first novel. He wanted to write about a special kind of person who can calm down angry horses. He met a farrier (a person who takes care of horses) on Dartmoor who told him about a horse that became calm after someone talked to it. This idea stuck with him.
Nicholas Evans went to America and visited many horse ranches. He learned about horses and the people who take care of them. He was alone and felt like his life was falling apart. He was worried about how he would feed his family and wondered if his dream of becoming a writer was foolish.
After six months of writing, he showed his book to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was good and said he could get $30,000 for it. Nicholas needed more money to pay off his debts, so he was happy. He sent the book to seven publishers and they all wanted to buy it. One publisher offered him $75,000 and another offered $1.5 million. This was a record-breaking amount for a first book.
The book was a huge success and many people wanted to make a film based on it. Nicholas was offered a lot of money to write the screenplay, but he didn't want to sell his rights. He wanted to keep writing his own books. He also got an offer to make the film, but he wasn't sure if he wanted to do it. He thought it would be better to write another book instead.

Fischer won the first game, but it's clear that he is not as strong as he used to be. He is out of practice and not as fit as he was in the past.
Chess has changed a lot since Fischer was last playing. Now, there are many professional chess players who compete in tournaments all around the world. The game is not just about being clever and strategic, but also about being strong and able to play for a long time.
Young players are doing very well in chess. In fact, most of the top players are under 30 years old. This is because the game has become more physical and demanding. Players need to be able to think quickly and make decisions fast.
Computers have also changed the way chess is played. Players can use computers to study their opponents' games and find weaknesses. This makes it harder for older players to compete.
Fischer is facing a tough challenge. He needs to be in top physical and mental shape to compete against the younger players. He will also need to be very prepared and study his opponents' games carefully.
It's not just about winning or losing, it's also about the mental and physical toll of playing chess. Players need to be able to handle the pressure and stress of competition. If Fischer can overcome these challenges, he might be able to prove that he is still a great chess player. But if he can't, he might find it difficult to accept defeat."

Volunteer Tourism
Some people travel to other countries to help with projects, like building homes or schools. But is this really helping? The people who organize these trips often charge a lot of money for the experience. This means that the money could be used to pay for more workers to do the same work. This is especially true for ""gap year"" travelers who don't have special skills or experience.
Some people think that these trips might not be truly helping others. Instead, they might be just a way for young people to gain ""cultural capital"" that will help them in their future careers. However, these projects can also help people develop good values and a sense of responsibility.
Volunteer tourism can also bring people together and help them understand each other better. This can lead to more peaceful and democratic societies. It can also create networks of people who care about global issues.
But there are also problems with volunteer tourism. It can be like colonialism, where wealthy people from rich countries try to help poor countries without really understanding their problems. It can also be just a way for wealthy people to feel good about themselves, without really making a difference.
Volunteer tourism can be a good thing if it's done the right way. It can help people learn new skills and understand different cultures. But it's important to remember that it's not just about individual acts of charity. We need to think about the bigger issues that cause poverty and inequality in the world.

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. Some people also need something to wake them up. That's where the clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? We tested five different clock radios. 
The first one we tested had a ""dual alarm function"". This means you can set two different wake-up times - one for weekdays and one for weekends. But this model is quite expensive. The second model is cheaper and has a cassette player. You can fall asleep listening to your favorite music and wake up without the news.
We all thought the radio sound was excellent. But the clock radio is quite big. Paul Bridges said he wants a clock radio that fits on his bedside table with his keys, wallet, and phone.
We tested five clock radios and chose the best one. The winner had a digital display with nice, easy-to-read numbers. The snooze button is easy to press with your eyes closed. The clock also has a special feature that keeps working even if the power goes out.
However, we found it hard to set up the clock radio. It took us a while to figure it out. Tom Granger thought the design was a bit tacky. He didn't like the extra light that came with it. Paul Bridges thought the lamp was a good idea, but the radio was hard to tune.
The last model we tested was the simplest and cheapest. It has an old-fashioned dial to tune the radio. Tom Granger liked it because it was easy to use and took up little space. The radio quality was good, and the buzzer worked well.

'Hedgehogs are small animals with sharp spines all over their bodies. They live in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can curl up into a ball when they feel scared or threatened. This helps protect them because their spines stick out. The more spines a hedgehog has, the better it can defend itself. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines and might try to run away instead of curling up. Hedgehogs usually sleep during the day and hide under bushes or in holes in the ground. They can sleep a lot, but some stay awake all year round if it's warm enough.'

It's not easy to be a great athlete, but women have to work even harder. They have to train a lot and make sacrifices in their personal life. But many women are achieving their goals and breaking records. We talked to six amazing British women who are doing just that.
A. Jill, 27, skier: ""I love the feeling of flying down the mountain, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don't feel well or it's windy and hard to see. But I keep going. It's not easy to have a life outside of skiing because I train for most of the year. But it was my choice.

C. Annabel, 26, rower: ""It's hard for girls to start rowing because not many schools offer it. So most girls start later and it's harder to be good at it. But I love rowing and the social life is great.
D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker: ""I've always loved walking. I walked across Australia and set a record! It was hard, but I had to do it to keep my sponsorship money.
E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer: ""Some men are mean to me when I'm racing. They think I'm not as good as them. But I'm competitive and aggressive, so I try to beat them. It's hard to make money in racing, but I love it.
F. Alison, 28, triathlete: ""I have to train a lot, but I love being fit. I also love the social side of racing. We women are working together to get more recognition and better prizes.""

I met Picasso when I was 18 years old. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco with a friend. We didn't have much money, so I got a job painting boats on the waterfront in Cannes. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant near the water. He was with his wife and some friends. I was surprised because Picasso was known to be a private person who liked to stay away from people.
I was carrying a sketchbook and decided to go over and ask for his autograph. He agreed, and then he drew a line on the paper. It was an unusual drawing, but it might have been inspired by the sea or the clouds.
After that, I started talking to Picasso, and we used a translator to communicate because he didn't speak much English. I told him about my love for art and my admiration for his work. He was very kind and friendly.
My friend told me to go back and draw a portrait of Picasso. I was a bit nervous, but I decided to try. Picasso started acting silly, making funny faces and poses. He was like a clown! I tried to draw him, but it was difficult because he was being so playful.
Finally, he stopped acting and let me draw him for a few minutes. I noticed that he was still very energetic and strong, even though he was 84 years old. His eyes were very intense and interesting.
After I finished drawing, Picasso wanted to see my portrait. I was a bit embarrassed, but he said it was okay. Then he took the crayon and drew a portrait of me. It was very different from mine, and I was surprised. He moved his eye to my nose and drew a line to represent my smile.
I thanked Picasso and asked him to sign the drawing. He said I already had his signature, so he wouldn't sign it again. I was grateful for the experience and felt lucky to have met Picasso."

**Selling Tricks in Shops**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more things than you planned? Shops use different tricks to make us spend money. Here are some of them:
**Fresh and Nice Smells**
Supermarkets put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance to make the store look nice and fresh. They also use a bakery to make the smell of freshly baked bread fill the store.
**Where to Put Things**
Shops put important products in easy-to-see places. They use computers to see which products sell the most and put them in those areas. They also put special offers in places where people are likely to see them.
**Making You Buy More**
Some shops put low-priced items far away from the entrance. This makes you walk past other products that are more expensive. They also put products they want to sell quickly in places that are easy to see.
**Making Things Look Good**
Some shops make their products look special by using nice packaging or displays. They also use green or other colors that make things look fresh and healthy.
**Pricing and Lighting**
Shops care about the prices of their products and how they look under the lighting. They want to make sure you can see the colors of the products clearly.
**Making You Walk Around**
Some shops divide their stores into different areas with different carpets. This makes you walk along a certain path and see other products along the way.
**Advertising**
Some shops use big pictures or videos to advertise their products. They also use special trolleys with screens to show you ads as you shop.
These are just a few tricks that shops use to make us spend more money. Next time you go shopping, see if you can spot any of these tricks!"

Chris Bonnington is a famous mountain climber. He climbed Mount Everest in 1985. Robin Knox-Johnston is a sailor. He sailed around the world alone in 1968-1969. They became friends and decided to work together on a project. They wrote a book about their adventure called ""Sea, Ice and Rock"".
I met Robin while I was working on a book about adventure. He invited me to join him on his yacht. I showed him some climbing skills, and he taught me about sailing. We sailed to a place called Skye and climbed a mountain. Robin was very good at climbing, even though he had never done it before. I was impressed.
Robin is a good leader. He always asked for our opinions and listened to what we had to say. I found sailing a bit boring, but Robin enjoyed it. He was good at fixing things on the boat. I felt a bit useless sometimes, but Robin was always helpful.
When we went to Greenland, we climbed a big mountain called the Cathedral. It was very difficult. Robin wasn't a good climber, but he tried very hard. I was worried about him falling, but he trusted me to keep him safe. We had to turn back because it was too hard. Robin was okay with it.
On the way back to the boat, we had a little argument. Robin didn't wake me up for my shift, and I felt like he didn't trust me. But he apologized and said I was wrong. After our Greenland adventure, I realized that Robin is a kind and sensitive person."

Apples have been around for thousands of years. People have eaten them since ancient times. They even grew apples in prehistoric times! 
In the past, people didn't have many varieties of apples like we do today. They mostly ate wild apples, which were small and not very sweet. 
The Romans taught the French how to grow apples. They brought apples to Britain and introduced new varieties. The British monks experimented with apples and created new types. 
In the Middle Ages, people in Britain grew many different kinds of apples. One popular apple was called the Pearmain, which was shaped like a pear. Another was the Costard, which was used for cooking. 
In the 16th century, Henry VIII wanted to learn about apple cultivation from the French. He sent a man named Richard Harris to France, and Harris brought back new apple varieties, including the famous Pippins. 
People took apples with them when they traveled to new countries. For example, the Pilgrim Fathers took apples to America. 
In the 19th century, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted apple seeds in North America. He was very kind and loved animals. 
In the 20th century, people discovered new apple varieties, like the Delicious and the Granny Smith. 
Now, apples are grown all over the world. But many apple varieties are disappearing because people prefer a few popular types. We need to protect the diversity of apples and other foods."

Richard Nerurkar, a good runner from Britain, visited the high-altitude training camp of Kenyan runners. The camp is located 10 miles south of Nairobi, near Mount Kenya, the highest mountain in Kenya. Richard had never trained with Kenyan runners before, but this time he got the chance. He even competed in a race in Kenya and stayed at the national team's training camp.
The camp is a simple place where the Kenyan runners live and train. They wake up early, have a simple breakfast, and then go for a run. They run three times a day, with a total distance of about 40 kilometers. On Sundays, they only have one run, which is a welcome break. The runners also eat simple meals, like ugali (a type of cornmeal), stew, and tea.
Richard was surprised by how hard the Kenyan runners work. They don't have many comforts, but they are very passionate about running. Richard thinks that this passion, along with their simple lifestyle and hard work, might be the reason why Kenyan runners are so good.

Advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic crisis. The problem is that advertising hasn't kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers think in terms of big groups of people and big media, but now there are many smaller groups and many different media. As a result, advertisements often don't reach the right people.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30-50 things. But most of these won't be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. In a year, you might buy around 400 different brands. Compare this to the 32,500 brands that are advertised. Most people don't buy most of these brands.
When you watch TV, you might see 1 in 16 commercials that are for brands you buy or might buy. The other 15 commercials are wasted. You might think you're special and immune to advertising, but you're not. Most people think the same, but it's not true. Most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised.
Advertising has to reach a lot of people to reach the right people. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Even with direct mail, which is more targeted, not everyone will respond. With media advertising, you can't know exactly who will respond.
The best way to make advertising more effective is to target the right people more closely. This is true for all kinds of advertising, not just products. Any campaign that can win over 2% of the population is very successful. The most effective way to reach this 2% might be through mass media, but advertising needs to be more targeted than ever before."

""Meet Charles Clover, a man who lives in a very special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This house is called the 'autonomous house' and it's very good for the environment. The house was designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale, who are experts in architecture. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and they recycle their sewage to make compost for their garden. They even heat their house with the warmth from their bodies, as well as from electrical appliances and their two cats, Edison and Faraday.
The house looks like a normal house from the outside, but it's very special inside. It's very quiet because it's super-insulated, with special windows that keep the noise out. When you enter the house, you have to take off your shoes because it's very quiet. The house is designed to be very efficient, with special ventilation systems that keep the air fresh and warm.
The Vales are very serious about the environment and have been designing green buildings for a long time. They wrote a book about it in the 1970s. They wanted to show that it's possible to build a house that doesn't harm the environment. They didn't use mains water or carbon dioxide, and they even designed special toilets that turn waste into compost.
The house is very energy-efficient and uses very little electricity. It's so efficient that it will soon be able to generate its own electricity and even charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, which they don't use very much.
The house is very comfortable, even in the winter. The temperature is around 18°C, which is lower than usual, but it's still comfortable because the house is so well-insulated. The Vales think that people should go back to living like they did in the past, before modern buildings were built. They think it's a good idea to build houses that are low-tech and easy to maintain, like the one they built."""

They cut out fairy pictures from a book and put them in the garden. The pictures are very nice, but the trick shows that the camera is not always honest.

Blacksmiths have always been important people. They work with iron and have made many useful things like tools and weapons. In the past, blacksmiths were like doctors and astrologers because they were so important. They made beautiful things too, like the ironwork in St Paul's Cathedral.
But in the past, blacksmiths became less important because factories didn't need them anymore. Now, people are interested in beautiful architecture and design again, and blacksmiths are becoming popular again.
There is a group called the British Artist Blacksmiths Association that wants to promote the craft of blacksmithing. They are having an exhibition of their work at a gallery in Surrey. The blacksmiths can make many different things, from small objects like bookends to big things like staircases.
The blacksmiths use special tools to shape the iron and steel. They like working with iron because it is soft when it is hot, but hard when it cools down. Some blacksmiths make things that look like they are from old castles, while others make things that are more modern.
Iron is a special metal that can be used in many different ways. It can make people feel safe and happy. The blacksmiths are happy to be able to make beautiful things with iron again."

I had been a heavy smoker for a long time, but then I went to a stop-smoking group. It was a strange feeling. I didn't want to stop smoking, but something changed that day. I think it was because the group leader talked to us about the dangers of smoking. It made sense, but I didn't want to listen. Then I started to feel good about not smoking. It was like I was in control. I didn't feel any strong cravings for cigarettes. The only time I struggled was when I was at home on weekends, doing nothing.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won a Nobel prize. She is not well-known in the UK, even though she was the only British woman to win a Nobel prize in science. I think people should know more about her.

Dorothy Hodgkin studied crystals and was very good at it. She lived through many big changes in the world, including the growth of women's education and the globalisation of science. She was a pioneer for women in science.
Some people think that scientists' lives are not interesting to read about. They think that only famous artists and writers are interesting. But this is not true. Scientists can have very interesting lives, just like anyone else.
In the past, it was hard to find books about scientists. Now, more and more books about scientists are being written. These books show that scientists are people too, with families and personal lives. They are not just about science.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a devoted mother and wife. She was also a very good scientist who solved many important problems. She won the Nobel prize for her work on penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin. Her life is an inspiration to many people.
It is important to learn about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin because they have made many important discoveries. Science is not just about complicated ideas; it is also about the people who do the work.

Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a special stick. She holds the stick above the ground and can feel when there is water below. This skill is very useful for farmers who have dry wells. Margaret and her husband run a business drilling wells, but they use her special skill to find the water first.
Many people don't understand how Margaret does it, but she says it's like a special feeling in her body. She thinks that everything on Earth vibrates, and she can feel these vibrations. Some people think she can smell the water, but Margaret says it's not that.
Margaret's customers are mostly farmers who need water for their farms. She tries to find the water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She has to be careful not to find water that might be dirty or have bad things in it. She also needs to find a place where it's easy to get electricity to run the pump.
To find the water, Margaret uses a map and a special tool called a pendulum. She moves the pendulum over the map to find where the water might be. Then, she walks over the fields with her special stick and feels when she is above the water. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill the well.
Margaret's husband also uses the stick, and they usually agree on where to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they do. Margaret's special skill is not just her, and many people have studied it. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment"". It's what helps her find water so accurately."

**Motivate Yourself to Lead**
What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires others and helps them to achieve their goals. It's not about being tall or smart, but about being enthusiastic and motivating others.
A good leader should be able to speak clearly and confidently. They should also be able to make things happen by working with others who are enthusiastic and interested.
Many people have the potential to be leaders, but they may not realize it. To become a leader, you need to recognize your talents, develop them, and use them.
A good leader is someone who motivates and supports their team. They help their team members to feel important and give them the information they need to succeed.
Leaders and managers are different. Managers follow rules, while leaders create their own path. A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can make a big difference and transform an organization.
Whether you're the boss or a team leader, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
* Find what you're passionate about and lead with enthusiasm.
* Think of yourself as a leader and recognize your abilities.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from your mistakes.
* Learn how to delegate and motivate others.
* Practice your communication skills and be open to feedback.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but also know when to step back and let others lead.
Remember, leadership is not just about being in charge, it's about making a positive impact on others."

I'm 34 years old and I've decided to leave my job and go backpacking. I'm a bit nervous because I've never done it before, but I want to see the world and have an adventure. I've been working for a long time and I feel like I've been stuck in a routine. I want to break free and do something new.
I'm not the only one who's feeling this way. Many people in their 30s are leaving their jobs and traveling. They're doing it for different reasons, but they all want to have an adventure and experience new things.
I'm a bit worried about leaving my home and my job behind. I'm not sure if I'll be able to adjust to a new way of living. But I'm also excited to see new places and meet new people. I'm taking a chance and doing something new, and I'm hoping it will be a great experience.

I took a break from my job as a journalist and felt out of touch with the latest technology. I was 37 years old and realized I needed to get back to work. My CV showed that I was stuck in the 1980s, when we used typewriters and paper. I didn't know how to use a computer, and most job ads asked for experience with desktop publishing. I thought I had no chance of getting a job.
I entered a competition and won a computer package for my family. This included a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for us all. We started learning about the Internet and how to use it. The children were already familiar with computers from school, but I was hesitant and worried about making mistakes. However, I learned the basics quickly and started working from home.
I set up a small office in our kitchen with a phone, fax machine, and modem. I could work while taking care of my children and still have time for other things. I started writing articles for a magazine and enjoyed the freedom of working from home.
Computers have changed my life. I used to work in a messy office and lose important papers. Now, I'm organized and can keep track of my work and finances easily. I can research stories and connect with other journalists from all over the world.
However, working from home can also be challenging. Sometimes I feel isolated, and there are distractions at home. But many people are now working from home, and it's becoming more common.
According to a report, most people who use computers at home are 38 years old and well-educated. I'm ahead of schedule because I've learned to use a computer and work from home. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be writing for a newspaper in Melbourne or publishing my own magazine. The possibilities are endless!"

The National Museum of Scotland is a new museum in Edinburgh. It has a modern and unusual building with a big tower and a garden on top. Some people like the building, but others don't. The museum is almost ready to open, and people are curious about what's inside.
The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history, using special objects and pictures. The stories are not just about important events, but also about everyday life. The museum doesn't try to make visitors feel proud of Scotland, but rather wants to show them the truth.
The museum's director, Dr. Clarke, wants visitors to have a good time and learn something new. He believes that objects can tell us more about the past than words or pictures. The museum has many interactive exhibits, including a special area for children.
The museum also has a special gallery on the top floor that changes every three years. The current exhibit is about important things that happened in Scotland during the 20th century. Some people think it's a fun idea, but others think it's not serious enough.
The museum's building is modern and interesting, but some people think it's not in the right place. However, the inside of the museum is very nice, and visitors can enjoy the exhibits and learn a lot.

The end of print newspapers might take some time. Change can be scary for some and exciting for others. But transition means moving from one place to another, and this can happen slowly and smoothly. However, the transition of newspapers from print to online is different. It's a difficult and uncertain process.
Many people think that print newspapers are dying because their sales are going down, but at the same time, more and more people are visiting their websites. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and other newspapers are losing readers, but their websites are getting more visitors. This might be true, but it's not the whole story.
Some experts say that the crisis is only affecting newspapers, but the numbers don't agree. The World Association of Newspapers says that global newspaper sales actually went up last year. In some countries, like Asia, newspaper sales increased. News and current affairs magazines even saw a 5.4% increase in sales.
The same thing is happening with books. Many people are buying e-readers, but book sales haven't dropped much. It's not a question of either print or digital, it's both. Some people still like to read newspapers and books in print.
Some people think that young people are giving up reading newspapers, but that's not true. Many young people still read newspapers. In the UK, for example, nearly 5 million people aged 15-35 read the main national dailies.
Different countries have different stories. In the UK, newspaper sales have gone down, but in Germany and France, the decline has been smaller. This shows that the situation is more complicated than people think.
Some experts thought that online advertising would make it easy for newspapers to switch to digital, but that's not happening. Many newspapers have put up paywalls, and the best way to attract paying readers is to offer both print and digital subscriptions together. Print advertising is also much more valuable than online advertising.
This means that newspaper companies have to keep both their print and online editions, which is expensive and difficult. But newspaper brands still have a strong reputation in print, and it's harder to be noticed online."

**Photographing People**
Taking pictures of people is the most interesting thing to do. A photo with someone in it is usually more exciting than a photo without a person. But taking good photos of people is hard. You need to think about their actions, gestures, and expressions. And sometimes the camera can make them feel uncomfortable.
**Taking Group Photos**
When taking a group photo, try not to line everyone up in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front to make it easier to see everyone's faces.
**Posing for Photos**
People often don't act naturally when taking a photo. They might look stiff and unnatural. To relax them, suggest they find a comfortable position. You can ask them to fold their arms or put their hands in their pockets.
**Getting Good Shots**
Don't pretend you're not taking a photo when you are. This can make people feel uncomfortable. Most people are happy to have their photo taken and might even be flattered. But they might feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them.
**Eye Contact**
A photo is more interesting if the person is looking directly at the camera. Ask them to look at the lens, not just smile. This can be hard for them to do for a long time, so remind them just before you take the photo.
**Candid Shots**
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the person can focus on something in the photo. This can be a good way to get a more natural shot. The viewer will follow their attention to another part of the photo.
**Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures can tell us a lot about the person in the photo. A happy child can make us smile, while a sad expression can make us feel sorry for them. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or anger.
**Background and Situation**
The background or situation can add interest to a photo. Try to exclude things that are not important to the subject. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
**Interaction**
Photos of people interacting with each other can be interesting. This can be couples, friends, family, or people working or playing together. Look for contact between them, like eye contact or physical touch.
**People and Places**
Many photos are taken on holiday or during an outing. To make these photos better, use a standard or wide-angle lens and stand back to get the whole scene in the frame. Ask the people to come close to the camera and compose the photo so the group is in the foreground and the background is visible.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Think about why you want to take the photo. If you want a good clear photo to remember someone, it's okay to ask them to pose. But if you're taking a photo of family or friends, candid shots are often better. They can be more lively and natural."

**Emotional Intelligence is Important for Success**
In today's world, it's not just about being smart or having the right skills. Employers also look for people who can work well with others and handle themselves in different situations. This is called emotional intelligence. It's not just about being nice, but about being able to manage your own and others' feelings to get things done.
In the past, being good at school was important, but now it's not enough. Employers want people who can work together, communicate well, and be flexible. Emotional intelligence is about being able to understand and control your own emotions, as well as being able to understand and help others.
Many companies are now realizing that emotional intelligence is important for success. In fact, it's more important than ever, especially in jobs that require teamwork and customer service. Emotional intelligence can be learned and developed over time, and it's an important part of growing up and becoming a mature person.
It's not a magic formula for success, but it's an important part of being a good employee and a successful person."

Acupuncture is an old Chinese treatment that is over 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help with many different health problems, but it is most commonly used to relieve pain.
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the body, mind, and spirit are in balance. It says that there is a special energy called Qi that flows through the body along special lines called meridians. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, the body can become unbalanced and people may feel sick.
When a traditional acupuncturist sees a patient, they will feel the patient's pulse, look at their tongue, and ask about their medical history, eating habits, and how they feel. They will then insert fine needles into the skin to help restore the flow of Qi. The needles may also be warmed with herbs or pressed to help stimulate the flow of Qi.
There are over 300 points on the body where acupuncture can be used. People often feel a mild ache or tingling sensation when the needle is inserted, which shows that the needle has reached the Qi.
Doctors in the West have studied acupuncture and found that it can be effective for pain relief. They have also found that it may work by blocking pain signals to the brain or releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals.
Acupuncture can be used to treat many types of pain, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is often used by people who have chronic pain that does not go away.
In China, acupuncture is used during surgery to help patients feel less pain. It is also used to treat people who are terminally ill. Acupuncturists claim that acupuncture can be used to eliminate pain during surgery, but this can vary from person to person.
Many people find acupuncture helpful, but it may not work for everyone. Acupuncturists say that it usually takes several visits to feel real relief from chronic pain.
Acupuncture is different from Western medicine because it looks at the whole person, not just the symptoms. Acupuncturists want to know what is causing the pain and how it is affecting the person's life.
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others do not believe in traditional Chinese theory. It is important to choose an acupuncturist who is qualified and experienced."

Here is a simplified version of the passage for an A2 learner:
Handwriting can tell us a lot about a person. In some countries, people use handwriting analysis, or graphology, to learn about someone's character and even their health. Graphologists say that handwriting can show if someone has certain illnesses, like heart disease or cancer. It can also reveal their personality, like if they are honest or not.
Some big companies use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want to work for them. The graphologist can tell if the person is a good fit for the job. Patricia Marne is a professional graphologist who says that handwriting can be very useful. She believes that it can show if someone is smart, if they are good at art or science, and even if they are a good or bad person.
Graphology can also be used to find out if someone might be a criminal. Patricia Marne says that criminals often have poor handwriting and that it can show up in their letters being messy or childish. She also says that graphology can predict if someone is going to get sick or if they are under a lot of stress.
Some doctors and psychiatrists are not sure if graphology is a good way to learn about people. They say that handwriting is just a product of how we are taught to write and has no special meaning. But Patricia Marne believes that graphology can be a useful tool and that it can even be more accurate than talking to a psychoanalyst. She thinks that more research is needed to make graphology a real science.

Is your office happy and healthy? A new survey says that fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace. We visited four different offices to see how happy and healthy they were. We had a team of experts to help us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist.
Office A: This office is very simple. There is no central heating or air conditioning, and the windows open straight onto the street. But the people who work here are very happy. They make sure the office is comfortable by opening doors and windows or using electric heaters. This might be because they are a small team and they like working together.
Ergonomist: The furniture is not very good. Most of it is old and not adjustable. But the people who work here have different jobs and work schedules, which helps them stay healthy.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff like the variety of their work and the office space. They think it's the right size - not too big or too small.

Ergonomist: The office is well-designed, but it's a bit impersonal.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff are happy and have good relationships. The office could be improved by making it more interesting and showing more information on the walls.
Office C: This office is a bit strange. It feels like a glass case with many offices. The air is good, even near the smokers. The desks and chairs are okay, but not great.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and boring. The chairs are not very good for computer users.

Chewing gum is very popular in the United States. People chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. But did you know that chewing gum has a long history? 
A long time ago, people in Greece and Turkey chewed a sticky substance from a special tree. They used it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. Later, people in America started chewing a sticky substance from spruce trees. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
In the 1800s, people in Central America discovered a special milky substance called chicle. They used it to make chewing gum. This gum was softer and more fun to chew than before. Many companies started making gum with chicle, but it was hard to get the chicle from the trees. 
Today, most gum is made with synthetic materials. This means that it is not made from natural things like trees. Some companies still use chicle, but it is hard to find. The people who collect chicle have a difficult job. They have to climb trees and deal with insects and snakes. 
Gum is good for your teeth. It helps to clean them and prevent cavities. Gum manufacturers say that chewing gum for 20 minutes can help to clean your teeth. They are always looking for new ways to make gum taste better and look nicer. Some gum is flavored with natural ingredients, but most is flavored with artificial things.
The United States has a lot of land dedicated to growing mint, which is used in many popular chewing gums."

Artist Susan Shepherd loves painting flowers. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, like tulips and poppies. Some of the plants grow wild and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path are very beautiful because of the previous owners who took good care of the garden. Susan also inherited a gardener named Danny. He helped her with the garden and understood what she wanted to do.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. She picks a flower, paints it, and then brings in another one to add to the painting. It can take a few days or even years to finish a painting. In the spring and summer, Susan is very busy painting the tulips and poppies. She also likes the way flowers change shape and color over time.
Susan has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers when she was a child. Now, she has many plants from all around the world in her garden. She doesn't worry too much about the garden, as long as it doesn't get damaged. With two upcoming exhibitions, Susan has been busy painting and hasn't had much time to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener to help her, but she knows it's important to get her hands dirty to stay connected to her art.

Many trees were knocked down in a big storm in March. The town's main square lost two big lime trees. This changed the way the town looked. The people who live there were not happy about it. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the police, was not happy either. But he was too sick to notice. He had bronchitis and couldn't leave his bed.
His wife, Molly, wanted him to go to the doctor, but he didn't listen. He thought the police needed him. He got worse and worse and finally went to the doctor. He got medicine and went home to rest.
When he woke up on Thursday morning, his wife told him that a big tree in their garden had fallen down. He was too weak to care. On Saturday, he started to feel better. He got out of bed and saw that the tree was gone. He was surprised and unhappy. The tree had made their living room look nice. Without it, the room looked bare and the old furniture looked old and worn out.
The house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It was an ugly house with purple bricks and pipes. It had many windows that looked into the Pelhams' garden. Chief Inspector Pelham didn't like the way it looked. His wife, Molly, thought they should buy a new sofa to make the room look better.

We had been living in our valley for 16 months. We thought we were safe and protected from any dangers. But then the weather changed. The snow came early, and it was deep. It blocked our path and made it slippery and difficult to walk. The wind was strong, but we were safe in our valley.
But then we worried about the river. It was usually calm, but now it was getting bigger and wilder. We remembered that many years ago, someone built a dam to control the river's flow. The dam was filling up, and we were worried that it might overflow. And then it happened - the dam overflowed, and the river became very powerful. The water was rushing down the stream, just below our home. It was deeper than we had ever seen it before. We were worried for three days, but luckily, the dam held, and the water went back down.
In the past, the river would flood the nearby villages, but now the dam helps to control it. We can enjoy the big clouds and the power of the river without being scared. Thanks to the dam, we feel safe in our valley.

I, Mark Adams, have been a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. Before this job, I did some small writing jobs for other newspapers, magazines, and the radio. I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also worked in radio and TV. He hired me, but he wasn't a good journalist. He thought that a team of critics should review books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would meet once a week to discuss what to write about. It was a new newspaper, and I was excited to be part of the team.
However, Tom's plan didn't work out. We didn't work well together, and everything was done over the phone. People preferred to read reviews from one person, so I focused on film reviews. I like my job now because I can write longer reviews and make my own choices. I don't have to watch every film that comes out, which is good because I wouldn't enjoy it.
Some people might think that a film review is like a guide to help them choose what movie to watch. But I don't think that's my job. I just have to give my opinion. I'm not a judge, and I don't think there should be a certain number of ""good"" or ""bad"" movies each year. My job is to explain why I like or dislike a movie.

A 17-year-old girl named Melanie loves sports and is very good at triathlons. A triathlon is a competition where you swim, cycle, and run. Melanie wants to find a training partner who is also good at these sports. She likes to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. She started doing triathlons when she was 14 and won the junior section. But she didn't give up even when she made a mistake and had to cycle 20 kilometers extra. She is very determined to keep training and wants to be an Olympic champion.
Melanie trains very hard and sometimes feels tired and wants to stop. But she knows that if she stops, she might not want to train again. She is very focused on her training and doesn't have much time for social activities. She talks to her friends on the phone and writes to them about their training times. She wants to enter even tougher events and has tried the ""sprint"" triathlon, which is shorter than the regular one.
Melanie's parents will have to pay £1,300 for her to go to the World Championships in New Zealand. She wants them to buy her a new bike, which costs £2,000, so she can train even better."

I like collecting things and I'm not alone. Many people collect things too. Some people collect stones, seashells, or even toys. I've been collecting things my whole life. I started when I was six years old. My parents took me to a museum and I saw lots of old things that people had collected. I was fascinated.
Some people collect things because it's the only thing they can control in their life. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing. There are many famous collectors, like the Duc de Berry in France and Catherine the Great in Russia. They collected all sorts of things, like cups and paintings.
You don't have to be rich to start a collection. I've collected things like tulip bulbs and china cups. I even found a rare American rag doll and added it to my collection. But one day, my house caught fire and my collection was destroyed. It was very sad.
What I find interesting is how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a famous person can be very valuable. This is why some old things are worth a lot of money now. Even toys from the 1950s are valuable if you still have the original boxes.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**
I help plan and prepare exhibitions at the science museum. This includes choosing what to show and how to explain it to visitors. I need to learn about the topic before the exhibition and talk to experts. I also make sure that visitors can understand the exhibition by planning interactive activities and displays. Before the exhibition opens, I help design the brochures and leaflets.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**
I teach people how to become London taxi drivers. I check the accounts and prepare materials for the students. They learn how to navigate the city by finding the shortest route to a destination. I help them solve problems and make decisions about which route to take. When they're close to the test, I give them a new route to try.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**
I work to protect the sea and its creatures. I respond to phone calls, create educational materials, and organize training courses. Sometimes I go to the office, but often I work from home near the coast. I also work with schools and organizations to teach people about the importance of marine conservation. I take people on boat trips to help them understand the sea better.

I work with maps and atlases. I make sure that the books we publish are accurate and useful. I also respond to letters from readers who have questions or concerns. I discuss new projects and sales with other publishers. I work with a friendly team, which makes the job more enjoyable. The only downside is that there is a lot of paperwork, which takes time away from more interesting tasks.

We always go to Ireland in June. For many years, we have spent the first two weeks of the month at a big house by the sea called Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. The house belongs to an English couple, the Malseeds. They made some changes to the house, but they did it quietly.
Our friend Strafe found Glencorn Lodge for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still looking for guests. We didn't like our holiday the year before because the food was bad. We have been friends for a long time, and we like to spend our holidays together.
When we arrived at Glencorn Lodge, Mrs Malseed was waiting for us in the big hall. She always knows when we are coming. She showed us to our rooms, which have names like Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mr Malseed greeted us with a big smile and said ""A hundred thousand welcomes!"" He was happy to see us.
We played cards for a bit, but then we were tired from our journey. In the lounge, there were other people, including a man and a French couple. We could see people walking around the garden and going down to the beach. In the morning, we will walk to the nearby village and have coffee. In the afternoon, we will go on a trip somewhere.
We have been coming to Glencorn Lodge for many years, and we love the beautiful landscape."

Miss Rita Cohen, a young woman who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter Marie, came to his factory one day. She was wearing overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. She was very small and looked like a child, but she was actually doing research at the University of Pennsylvania for her Master's degree. Seymour's daughter Marie loved learning new things, and Rita seemed to be the same.
Seymour had helped students from his factory before, answering their questions over the phone or giving them a tour. Rita was interested in the leather industry and asked many questions about the factory. She wanted to know how many gloves were made in a shipment and how they were shipped. Seymour was happy to help her.
Rita asked to see the tannery where the leather was made. Seymour said it was a good idea, but it was a dirty and old-fashioned place. He offered to take her there and show her how the leather was made. Rita was excited to learn and said she had never seen anything being made before.
Seymour noticed that Rita was similar to his daughter Marie - she was curious and loved learning new things. He decided to show her the whole process of making gloves from start to finish. He asked her what size she wore, and she said she didn't know. He offered to make her a pair of gloves and she could watch them being made.

His friends were scared, but they eventually followed him. They all lay in the sawdust, laughing and telling jokes.
Later, one of Michael's friends said, 'Let's go up the roof again and jump down.' They all went up, but Michael was hesitant. He wanted to join his friends, but he was scared.

'Chocolate is a very popular food around the world. In the UK, people spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter. In fact, eight percent of all chocolate is bought at this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. Chocolate has a long history. It was first grown by the Aztecs and Mayans over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a special plant that grows in many warm places. The fruit of the tree is big and has 20-40 seeds. When the seeds are dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate.
The Aztecs used cacao beans as money and to make a special drink called xocoatl. This drink was bitter and was used for special occasions. The Spanish people liked it with cinnamon and sugar, but it didn't become popular in Europe until much later.
In the 17th century, people started to drink chocolate in special houses in Europe. Until the 19th century, chocolate was made by melting solid blocks of chocolate in hot water. But then a man invented chocolate powder, and this made it easier to make chocolate. In 1847, a company in Bristol made the first chocolate bar that you could eat.
Over time, chocolate companies have come up with new ways to make chocolate. They added milk to make milk chocolate, and now they are trying to make new products like ice cream and soft drinks. But some farmers who grow the cacao beans are still having trouble because of a big drop in prices many years ago. So, next time you eat a chocolate bar, think about the people who grew the beans.'"

When you travel to a new country, it's frustrating when your luggage is left behind. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your bag. This can happen even if you're in a different climate and have no suitable clothes. Airlines don't usually tell us how often this happens, but it's a common problem.
Even good airlines make mistakes sometimes. They can't guarantee that your luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have a layover. Here's how it works: airlines ask you to arrive at the airport early so that your bag can get to the plane on time. They also have minimum connecting times, which are the shortest time it takes to switch planes. But sometimes flights are delayed, and this can cause problems.
There are also human mistakes or accidents that can happen. For example, someone might take off the destination label. This can happen more often at big airports where many people are changing planes. London's Heathrow airport is one of the busiest, and many people have trouble with their luggage there.
To avoid problems, try to take direct flights whenever you can. Check in early, and make sure your luggage is clearly labeled with your home and holiday addresses. If you have a layover, try to fly with the same airline and give yourself extra time to get to your next flight. If your luggage still goes missing, go to the baggage hall and fill out a report before you leave the airport.

The park is good for little children, so our three-year-old had a lot of fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Big Wheel. There's a special ride for little kids that was very popular. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! We were tired after five hours, but the children didn't want to leave.

Wonderland - The McMillan family None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. Our little boy, Oscar, loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and the little buildings that were his size. The older kids liked the Ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a special road. We spent six hours there and were happy to have places to rest. The park is very nice and the staff are friendly.
Adventure World - The Jeffree family After seven hours, we still had a lot to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus and the trapeze act. They also liked the Running River ride, which was very exciting. For little kids, Toy Land is a lot of fun. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small to go on it. The park is well-designed, so waiting in line isn't boring. The park is very clean and the staff are great.
The Great Park - The Langridge family We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at five. This park is good for little kids because the rides aren't too scary. Even I, who is a bit scared, enjoyed myself. We all loved the Exotic Travels boat ride. We waited for half an hour for the Lightning River ride, and it was over before we knew it! If the kids were a bit older, they might have found it boring, but they were the right age and loved it.
Fantasy World - The Break-all family According to the park's advertising, there is ""No Limit to the Fun"", and we felt that was true. The park has many big rides, including Europe's tallest roller-coaster. The kids went on some rides several times. Sarah was too small for a few rides, but enjoyed the Long Slide. Some staff were very helpful, but not all were friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have told the kids we were going home early.

**Running a business in the countryside**
Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside. 
**A. Christine Hogan**
Christine runs a computer business from her home. She and her husband moved to the countryside for a quieter life. She used to work with computers before she got married, so her husband suggested she start her own business. It was hard at first, but she was careful with money and worked hard. Now she has a small business with four employees. She likes being able to work from home and can work in the evenings if she wants.
**B. Maggy Sasanow**
Maggy is a designer who works from home. She used to work in art and wanted to stay in the art world. She started her own business making greeting cards. She sells them to museums and people send work to her from London because she is cheaper than other artists. She works in a big room upstairs and sometimes has to do chores like mowing the lawn. She likes being independent and working for herself.
**C. Delia Turner**
Delia started a curtain-making business eight years ago. It was successful at first, but then the economy got bad and she had to lay off her employees. Now she works with her husband and some women who work from home. She has to be careful with money and look for new opportunities. She likes being able to work from home, but sometimes it's hard to find new customers.
**D. Tessa Strickland**
Tessa runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside because it was cheaper and she loves the country. She works with authors and artists from all over the world and has to take calls at odd hours. She likes being able to work when she wants, but sometimes it's hard to shut the office door and focus.
**E. Meg Rivers**
Meg runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She started making cakes at home and soon got requests from friends and relatives. She now employs six people and has a shop where everything is made. She used to make the cakes herself, but now she runs the commercial side of the business. Her biggest problem was getting enough money to start the business.

Meet the Amazing Watkins Family
The Watkins family is special because they are all musicians. The father, John, makes instruments. He even made a cello for his son, Paul, when Paul was a boy. Paul is a talented musician and has won many awards. His brother, Huw, is also a musician and is starting to make a name for himself.
John Watkins used to be a school teacher. He decided to make instruments because he wanted to save money for his son's cello. He learned how to make instruments at a school in Wales. He made Paul's first cello, and it turned out well. Paul used it until recently.
Paul and Huw both started playing music when they were young. Paul started with the piano, but then he loved playing the cello. Huw started with the piano too, but then he wanted to play something different. He liked the sound of the cello and started taking lessons.
John Watkins is very proud of his sons. He is happy to see them succeed in their music careers. Paul is now playing in a big orchestra and has even won a big competition. Huw is starting to make his own music and is going to perform at a famous concert hall.
The family is very busy with music. Paul and Huw have concerts and performances coming up, and John is working on making new instruments. The family is happy to be together and support each other in their music careers."

The National Trust helps to take care of the countryside in the UK. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talked to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust. He told me what it takes to be a good warden.
""You need to be sensible and able to deal with different people,"" Gareth said. ""You work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders, so you need to be good at communicating.""
Gareth grew up on a farm on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked there until he got married. When the Trust advertised for a warden for the area, Gareth applied. He didn't have special training, but he knew the area well and had experience working on his parents' farm.
""I think it's helpful that I still work on the farm with my parents,"" Gareth said. ""I can understand farmers' problems and they know they can trust me.""
As a warden, Gareth's job is to take care of the land, including planting trees, building fences, and helping farmers. He also works with conservationists to protect the natural environment.
Gareth used to love picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was a child. But now he sees that farming has changed the countryside. He thinks that farmers were just doing what they were told by the government, but now he is working to help farmers and conservationists work together.
Gareth's job is to make sure things get done quickly and efficiently. He enjoys seeing projects finished and meeting the public. But sometimes he has to deal with people who are not very nice.
""If you like the outdoors and are sensible, you might like to be a warden like me,"" Gareth said. ""But you'll have to be patient because it's a competitive job!"""

Meet England's Netball Captain
We are talking to Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. She is very busy getting ready for the World Championships next month. She teaches at a local school and then does a training session in a parking lot. 
I asked her if she gets strange looks from people. She said she is too focused on her movements and feet to notice. She is very focused on being the best for the Championships.
Kendra is playing in her fourth World Championships. This time, 27 countries will be participating. She thinks it will be very exciting to have the support of the home crowd. 
Their first game is against Barbados. Kendra says they usually beat them, but it will be a tough game. The England team is ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows it will be hard to win. 
Netball has become a faster and more aggressive sport over the years. Players need to be very fit and strong. As captain, Kendra wants to be a good example for her team and help them work together. 
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She wants to finish playing at the World Championships and then maybe become a coach. She is very focused on this last big event. When she leads her team out onto the court, she might even have a tear in her eye.

'SPECIAL MUSIC SCHOOLS
What to do with a child who is very good at music? It's not always easy to help them develop their talent. Many parents don't recognize their child's gift until the child becomes frustrated and behaves badly. Schools are good at helping children who are good at other subjects, but they might not be able to help musically gifted children as much. This is where specialist music schools come in.
There are five music schools in Britain that are especially for children who are very good at music. These schools are new and aim to give children a supportive environment to learn and practice music with professional musicians. Children at these schools spend a lot of time learning music, like playing instruments, singing, and playing in groups. They also have some time for other subjects like English, maths, and science.
The schools are small and have a lot of teachers, so the children get a lot of attention. Most children who go to these schools live at the school, which means they can focus on their music all the time. This can be good for them, but it's not for everyone.
There are some problems with these schools. They are expensive, with fees of £12,000 to £17,000 per year. However, the schools try to help parents who can't afford it. Some parents might not want their children to live away from home, especially when they're young. The schools think it's best to wait until children are a bit older before sending them to a specialist school.
It's important to remember that setting children apart from others can cause stress. Some children might lose their musical talent as they get older, and the pressure to be good at music can be too much. The schools try to help children who are struggling and make sure they are happy and healthy. Some people who went to these schools think it was a great experience, but others think the academic programme was too limited.
It might be better to wait until children are older before sending them to a specialist school. They might do well in a normal school with a good music department or by taking music lessons on Saturdays. This is not an option for everyone, but it's something to consider.'"

Susan Shepherd is a famous artist who paints flowers. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, like tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wild and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path are very beautiful, with a mix of colors, shapes, and sizes. This is because the previous owners of the house loved gardening and left many plants that Susan likes. She also inherited a gardener named Danny.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers, not the whole garden. She picks a flower, paints it, and then brings in another one to add to the painting. It can take a few days or even a few years to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times when the tulips and poppies bloom.
Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from the countryside. She likes how they grow in unexpected places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops. Now, her garden has plants from all over the world, but they look like they belong here. Susan doesn't worry too much about the garden; she just wants to make sure it's not too damaged. With two exhibitions coming up, she's been too busy painting to spend much time in the garden lately. She now has an extra gardener to help, but she knows that to stay inspired, ""you have to get your hands dirty""."

Want to get your writing published? Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many people write to us asking, ""Where can I send my story?"" The first thing they need to know is that they should research the market and learn about publishers. It's like learning a new game. You need to know what kind of writing is popular and what publishers are looking for.
One way to do this is to read a lot. Go to your local library and bookstore and read different types of books and magazines. This will help you understand what kind of writing is popular and what publishers are looking for. You should also update your knowledge as new books and magazines come out.
If you want to write love stories, for example, you should find out which magazines publish them and read recent copies. Then, you can see what kind of stories they like and who their readers are. You need to write what readers want.
Some people send me their stories and ask if they are good enough. I always try to be honest, but I also try to be positive. Most new writers send their work too soon. They need to write more and practice. When you send your work, keep writing more. Each story will be better than the last, and you will become a better writer.
Don't show your work to others until you are sure it's good. Every successful writer has had many rejections before they became successful. To improve, you can take a creative writing course or join a writers' group. Think of yourself as a writer and write every day if you can.

I was waiting for a train at the Baltimore railway station. It was a busy day and there were many people waiting. An older man was walking around, talking to strangers. He was well-dressed and seemed friendly. He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said no. Then he asked another woman, but she said she was going to New York. He didn't ask me, even though I was going to Philadelphia. He looked stressed and worried.
He found a woman reading a book and asked her if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes, and he asked her for a favor. He told her that his daughter was flying to Philadelphia and had forgotten her passport. He had left his wife at home and couldn't go back to get the passport himself because she is in a wheelchair. The woman was kind and sympathetic, but I thought the man's story was suspicious. He was holding a big, padded envelope that looked like it might be important. I thought he might be trying to trick the woman.

My son Gary is a famous TV chef. I, John Moore, am his father and the owner of a restaurant. I believe everyone gets a chance in life. Gary got his chance with cooking, and I got my chance to run a restaurant. When I saw the restaurant, it was in bad shape, but I knew it was perfect for me. It reminded me of my childhood when my mother worked and I was left alone. I wanted to make sure my family had time together. My wife helped with the children and the accounts, and I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped our children, Gary and Joe, become confident.
Gary was a lively child. He used to play in the bath like it was a swimming pool. He started working for pocket money when he was older. He would help in the kitchen on weekends and earn a lot of money. He was very responsible and would wake up early. I was happy to see him helping out in the family business.
Gary wasn't very good at school, but he loved cooking. By the time he was 15, he was as good as the other cooks in the kitchen. He even got to be in charge sometimes. He would cook over 100 meals by himself. I knew then that he would go into the catering business.
Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I told him to focus on one thing at a time, or he might not achieve anything. He went to catering college at 17 and was very good at it. He even helped other students on his first day. Now, his TV cookery show is very popular. I'm very proud of him.

People love dolphins. They are very smart and can understand human emotions. We often see them in movies and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in trouble. Dolphins live in the ocean and we need to take care of them.
There are many different types of dolphins. Some live far out in the ocean, and we don't know much about them. Others, like the bottlenose dolphin, used to live near European coastlines. Now, they are very rare. They are stressed and have injuries on their skin.
Dolphins have a hard time finding food because of overfishing. Fishermen use big nets that can catch dolphins too. Sometimes, dolphins get stuck in these nets and die. They can also eat food that has bad things in it, like pesticides. These bad things can make them sick and even kill them.
The worst part is that humans are disturbing the dolphins' homes. The noise from ships and other things can bother them. We don't know exactly how it affects them, but it might be very bad.
We need to take care of dolphins. We should protect their homes and make sure they have enough food. We should also stop polluting the ocean and making too much noise."

EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOU Exercise is important for your body and mind. It helps you stay healthy and strong. There are many reasons why you should exercise. Exercise makes your muscles stronger and helps you look good. It also helps you feel better and sleep better. Exercise can even help with stress and depression. 
There are many types of exercise you can do. You can try aerobics, jogging, or working out with weights. But remember to start slowly and carefully. It's also a good idea to talk to a doctor before you start a new exercise routine.
Good posture is important too. If you slouch, you might look and feel tired. Imagine a balloon pulling your head up to help you stand up straight. This will make your body look slimmer and feel more energetic.
Stretching is also important. It helps you move easily and prevents injuries. You should stretch four or five times a week. A good exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, a workout, and a cool-down.

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves the ocean. She works at a university in Southampton and teaches about the ocean. She also does research on the chemicals in the sea. When she's not teaching, Rachel goes on special underwater trips to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a special vehicle that's like a small car to dive down to the ocean floor.
The vehicle is very small, so Rachel has to stay inside. She can reach out and touch the pilots who drive the vehicle. It takes three hours to get to the bottom of the ocean, then they collect samples for 10 hours, and then it takes three hours to get back up. If something goes wrong, Rachel can press a button and a small escape vessel will take her to the surface quickly.
Rachel has made six dives so far. She's even dived with a Russian team to a place where there are many underwater volcanoes. The volcanoes are very hot and make black smoke. Rachel loves her job and loves teaching, but she also loves doing research on the underwater volcanoes.

First impressions are very important. People usually make judgments about us within a few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak. Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She was proud of her degree and felt confident when she applied for a job at a school.

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who take care of themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. He thinks it's important to look good for an interview. Many people forget about this and don't make a good impression.
Facial expressions and body language are also important. A psychologist found that most of what we communicate comes from our facial expressions, not what we say. So, make sure your words and body language match.
It's also important not to be too excited or eager for a job. Sheila Rice got a job offer, but she was too happy and the boss offered her a lower salary. Finally, it's a good idea to learn about the company before an interview and ask questions. This will show that you're interested and can help you get the job.

**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
A Darius (runner) - I like sports. When I was young, I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on running instead. My biggest achievement was running for my country's youth team and getting a medal. I wish more people had noticed, because it would have been great to get some help with my training. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun - there are good running tracks and nice nightlife. But I have to be disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before a training session, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but it's worth it. My goal is to go to the next Olympics.
B Gabriel (surfer) - The surfing community is small, so you see the same people everywhere you compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are early in the morning. If you want to be good, you have to give up late nights. I don't mind that much, but I do like sleeping in. But it's worth it because without that dedication, I might not have won the National Championships. After a win, I like to celebrate with a big night out. And if there's money involved, I might go somewhere nice. It's worth it because winning that championship helped me get a job presenting a surfing show on TV. Now, people know who I am.
C Dieter (yacht racer) - When we're on a boat with five friends, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and like to celebrate our wins. People say we act a bit silly when we're out, but we don't try to get attention from the media. Sometimes reporters are more interested in where we go out and what we do there than in our racing results. I'm away from home for eight months a year, so it's great to come back and do normal things with my friends. You can't live only for the sport - it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I don't get recognized often. I'm happy about that.
D Tomas (tennis player) - It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd supporting me. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. But I still get a thrill when fans recognize me when I'm out shopping or something. However, it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players have to travel a lot, and that's why we split up. You have to make sacrifices in any sport. I'm okay with that. I'm focused on my game now and will catch up on other things when I retire, because that will happen soon in this sport."

Shopping with kids can be very difficult. One mother says that her children always want everything they see. She can't afford it all and feels guilty if she buys them things she doesn't think are good for them. But if she says no, she feels bad too. She tries to avoid taking them shopping, but then she worries that she's not letting them learn how to make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they're shopping with their parents. Companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. This can make it hard for parents to say no to their children's requests. Children often don't understand why they can't have something, and the advertising makes it hard for parents to explain.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says that parents are worried about what their children eat and want to make healthy choices. But it's hard to know what's healthy and what's not. She thinks it's good that parents and children talk about food and products, but it's hard for parents to compete with advertising.
Some parents feel stressed when shopping with their kids because they have to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says that she talks to her son about products and labels, and he's learned to be critical of advertisements. They don't have many arguments when shopping now.
Parents also admit that they're not always consistent in what they buy for their kids. Mike, a father, says that he and his wife say no to certain treats, but they still buy unhealthy foods for themselves. It's hard to be consistent.
Supermarkets could make it easier for parents and kids to shop together by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for kids. This might even attract more customers who want to shop without the stress of dealing with their children's demands."

""Ice Skating
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. People used to make skates from animal bones. Later, they made skates from iron. In the old days, skating was a special skill for rich people in Scandinavia. 
In the past, skating was only for rich people and was considered stylish. But in the 1920s, a young girl named Sonja Henie showed that skating could be fun and exciting. Now, skating combines art and sport. 
To start skating, you need to learn how to balance and control your body. You should keep your knees slightly bent and your body weight centered. It's also important to relax and have fun. 
When you start skating, keep your feet close together and push off with one foot while moving the other foot a little bit. As you get better, you can try longer movements. 
It's also important to learn how to fall safely. Even good skaters fall sometimes! To get up, get on your knees and then stand up. 
There are different types of skating, like figure skating and speed skating. To start, you should learn figure skating and then try freestyle. Most ice rinks have coaches who can help you learn. 
To improve, you should practice regularly and do exercises to loosen up your body. This will help you move smoothly and safely on the ice. Skating can also help you get healthier and stronger. You can even combine it with swimming or jogging for a great workout.""

Some people get very happy when they win a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young people who won medals to talk about their lives. 
A. Annika Reeder is 15 and won a gold medal for gymnastics. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the Olympics. 'I have to work very hard. I don't have time to watch TV or play with friends. I try to do my training every day. Sometimes I get very tired, but my coach gives me a day off sometimes.'
B. Annika's mother 'Annika was very good at gymnastics from a young age. She loves it and it has helped her become more confident. Before she started gymnastics, she was shy and hid behind me. Now she knows people from all over the world.'
C. Sarah Stokes is 12 and loves show-jumping. She has won a big competition and wants to win a gold medal at the Olympics. 'My parents help me and take me to shows. I don't get tired of it because it's fun. I love competing and I'm very determined.'
D. Sarah's mother 'Sarah loves horses and has been riding since she was one year old. She's very good at it and has to travel all over England to compete. We sleep in our horse box to save money.'
E. Jane McShane is 10 and is very good at chess. 'I like playing chess because it's fun. I know everyone and it's not scary. I don't talk about my wins at school because I don't like being embarrassed.'
F. Jane's mother 'Jane started playing chess when she was five. She loved it and got better very quickly. I'm happy when she wins, but I wouldn't stop her if she wanted to give up. I just want her to be happy and use her talent.'

Chris Greener is a very tall man. He is 228 cm tall, which is the tallest in Britain. Many people are getting taller because we are eating better food. A long time ago, our ancestors ate many different foods like fruits, berries, and plants. They were healthy and strong. But then people started farming, and this changed everything. They grew only a few foods like wheat, rice, and maize. This food was not good for our health, and we became shorter and weaker.
Now, some countries like the US, Holland, and Japan are eating a variety of foods again, and people are getting taller. In fact, the average height in these countries is 179-180 cm. But, this is causing problems. For example, beds and planes are not designed for tall people. We don't know how tall we can get. Some scientists think we might reach 193 cm, but others think we might even get smaller because of global warming.

Do you ever wonder what it's like to watch a TV show being made? I went to a TV studio to find out. I thought that people who go to TV shows were silly and just wanted to be on TV. But I was wrong. People from all walks of life come to TV shows. They come from different jobs, families, and places. TV tries to get people with different backgrounds to watch different types of shows.
I thought it would be boring to sit in a studio and watch TV. But people go because they might get on TV, or because they're curious to see how TV shows are made. Some people just got tickets from friends. I talked to some people who went to a TV show. They said it was exciting and fun.
I went to a TV show and saw that it wasn't like watching TV at home. The actors were far away, and I had to watch on a small screen. But for most people, it was just a fun night out. They didn't care about the technical things; they just enjoyed the show.

I don't like empty, wild places. I like places with people and things that people have made. When I travel, I like to visit villages with old buildings and temples. When I was a child, I went to school in England and on weekends, I would ride my bike to a village called Lastingham. I loved exploring the hills and valleys and old villages. I even wrote about my adventures in a diary. Now, I still go back to England and visit that place.
I also like a special train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It's a small train and the people who run it are volunteers. The scenery is not very exciting, but I like looking at the people's gardens and homes as we pass by. I like seeing what people do in their daily lives.
My friends like to go to a place called the Hartland Peninsula. It's a remote and beautiful coast with no crowds. They like to walk along the beach and look at the sea. There are also walks you can take inland to see the woods and flowers.
I like a place called the Trough of Bowland. It's a big, open area with no people and not many visitors. I discovered it when I was a student and I go back every year. Now, I take my son with me and it's special because he's growing up in a city.
I also have a special house in England that I love. It's called Glenthorne and it's a quiet, romantic place where I can relax. I grew up in a different country, but I went to school in England and I love this place.

We love animals. One day, my daughter found a nice snake. She asked if we could keep it. I said yes, but only for one night. We have a special tank for animals that come to visit. I was late coming home. When I arrived, my sons were screaming. Domino, our cat, had caught a white mouse. The mouse was waving its feet in the air. I rushed to help. But then I tripped and fell down. As I got up, I saw the snake. It had escaped from its tank and was crawling around the room. The cat, mouse, and kids were all running around, making a lot of noise. The snake was hissing and trying to bite. I had to be careful not to get hurt.
I finally managed to catch the cat and get the mouse out of its mouth. Then I looked for the snake. It was very big and strong. I sat down on the floor and slowly moved my hands under the snake. It was very slow and careful, but I was able to pick it up and carry it outside. I pointed to a tree and let the snake go. It slid up the wall and disappeared over the roof. My youngest son said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!"""

'Drop me a line! In today's world of phones and computers, writing letters is becoming less popular. But I think it's special to receive a letter. There's the excitement of getting it, seeing who it's from, and reading what's inside. I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember. When I was a child, I would write notes to my mother. My mother always wanted me to write thank-you letters for presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I left home to study medicine in London, I would write to my mother every week, and so would she. Sometimes my father would write too, and it was always fun to receive his letters. Most of the letters from home were about everyday things that happened to my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters more.
I also received letters from my boyfriends when I was young. I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away from home, so we kept in touch by writing. Writing helped our relationships. I found it easier to express myself in writing than talking.
I love getting letters with birthday or Christmas cards. It's nice to have a year's worth of news! And it's even better when the envelope has nice stamps. I get letters from friends in different countries, like Sri Lanka and Australia. I also have a penfriend in France. We met in a restaurant and became friends. We write to each other regularly and have visited each other's homes.
I'm happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I want them to write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little notes, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I think it's important to keep writing letters, so I encourage you to do the same.'

Tens of thousands of old pictures are being destroyed on a mountain in France. The pictures are on the rocks and are very old - 4,000 years old! They show cows, fields, and gods and goddesses. But many tourists are damaging the pictures by writing on them or taking pieces of the rock as souvenirs.
The people in charge of the site are worried. They think that if the damage continues, the pictures will not be there for future generations. They say that some tourists are not careful and are damaging the pictures. They even take pictures of the drawings and then rub them to make them look better.
Some experts think that the best way to save the pictures is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, so that only guided tours can go there. But others think that this is not the best solution. They think that it would be better to let people visit the site, but with guides who can help them not to damage the pictures.
The problem is that it is difficult to find the money to employ guards to protect the site. Some people think that the government should provide the money to save the pictures. If we don't take action, the drawings will be lost forever.

Shopping with children can be very difficult. One mother says that her children always want everything they see. They want the latest cereal, a Disney video, or a comic. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty when she buys them something they don't need. She also feels bad when she says no to their requests. 
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are with their parents at the supermarket. Companies spend a lot of money on advertising to children, especially on TV. This can be confusing for children because they don't understand why their parents can't buy them everything they want.
Many parents worry about what their children eat and want to teach them about healthy food. However, children often don't understand why they can't have certain foods. They just see the fun and colorful advertisements.
A expert says that parents are unhappy because they feel they are competing with the advertising industry. They feel like they are always saying no to their children and it's hard to be consistent. Some parents are even hypocritical, saying no to their children's requests for sweets while buying unhealthy foods for themselves.
Supermarkets could make shopping easier for parents by removing sweets from the checkout area or providing a play area for children. This would make parents happy and might even attract more customers.

Climbing is a popular sport. Climbers used to go to mountains to climb, but now they can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The World Cup Climbing Championships are being held at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. The arena is famous for hosting TV shows, including Gladiators. The climbing competition is taking place on ""The Wall"", which is a special climbing wall.
In the past, climbers would climb on cliffs, but this was only possible when the weather was good. In the winter, they would climb on snow and ice in Scotland or go for a walk instead. Climbers needed to stay fit, so they would climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped keep their fingers strong and stopped them getting bored.
Sports centres started building climbing walls for climbers to practice on. These walls were made of bricks with special edges for climbers to grip. A teacher named Don Robinson built the first climbing wall in a university corridor. He had an idea to set natural rock into concrete, which could be used to build walls. Many climbing walls were built in sports halls across the country.
However, these walls had some problems. They were only straight and didn't have the same features as real cliffs, like overhangs and angled rocks. Climbers would get bored with the same old holds and combinations. A Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a special material that could be shaped like cliff holds. These holds could be attached to any wall and taken off when climbers got bored. French manufacturers also created panels that could be attached to a steel frame. This made it possible to build walls with overhangs and change the holds easily.

Do you want to be an actor? If you say this, people will often say it's a risky job. And it's true, there are more actors than there are acting jobs. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might think you're crazy, but others might be very supportive. Everyone has different advice. It's a personal choice, and only you can decide if it's right for you.
There's no easy way to become an actor. There are no exams to pass or a guarantee of success. It's a mix of luck and talent. But there are always new opportunities and the chance to be famous. People often ask what makes someone talented. I think it's a combination of natural ability and imagination. It's hard to know for sure, but it's also about being brave and believing in yourself.
Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain, but one important thing is the moment when an actor connects with the audience. This is what makes acting special, whether it's on stage or screen. Actors don't always know what makes them good at their job. They just know what works for them and what they've learned from others. But they never take anything for granted, because they know they can lose their job at any time. The biggest challenge for an actor is disappointment.
Actors often don't talk about their chances of getting a job. They find ways to deal with the stress of auditioning and the possibility of being rejected. Nobody likes being rejected. As soon as you start looking for acting jobs, you have to be ready for the possibility of rejection. You have to show that you're willing to take risks and care about your work. If you don't care, nobody else will either."

Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain. He is 228 cm tall. This is because people are getting taller every year. In fact, every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows by 1 cm.
In the past, people used to eat a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. This made them strong and healthy. But then people started to farm and grow crops like wheat, rice, and maize. This changed their diet and made them shorter and less healthy.
For a long time, people ate foods that were not good for them. They ate soups, porridges, and breads that did not give them enough nutrients. This made them weak and sick. In one study, scientists found that when people started eating corn, they became unhealthy and underweight.
Now, some countries are changing their diets and eating more of the foods that their ancestors used to eat. This has made people taller and healthier. In the US, the average man is now 179 cm tall. In Holland, it's 180 cm, and in Japan, it's 177 cm.
But there are some problems with this trend. For example, beds and clothes are not getting bigger to fit the taller people. Scientists are not sure how tall people will get or if they will ever stop growing.
Some scientists think that people might get as tall as 193 cm, but others think that the Earth's climate might make people shrink instead. The Earth is getting warmer, and this might make people smaller again.

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are very good at a game they played as children. They are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and playing the game with their wooden board. The game is called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, where it was very popular.
The family played the game every weekend and holiday. When they moved to New Mexico, they continued to play. The game was new to the people in the area, and they were curious about it. One day, Dave made a new board, and people started to ask about the game. They wanted to play it.

Welcome to the Model Village! This place used to be a piece of wasteland, covered in brambles. But a man named Colin Sims and his wife worked hard to make it into what you see today. They moved a lot of soil and clay to create the hills and valleys. It took a lot of hard work and help from machines to make it look like this.
Colin planted many trees and flowers around the village. He chose plants that can survive in the salty air near the sea and strong winds. Some plants came from local gardens, while others came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.
The models in the village were made by Colin over nine years. He used different materials like stone, concrete, and wood to make them strong. He had to learn how to make them from experts, but soon became an expert himself.
You will notice that everything is the same size and that even the smallest details are correct. This took a lot of patience and special techniques. The village is very popular and people come from all over to see it. The way the models are made has even been used in other model villages and in schools.
The buildings in the village are like the ones you would find in England, but they are not exact copies of any one place. You will see a big house called the Manor House, a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models. You can take photos from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are allowed on a short lead.
We hope you enjoy your visit and would like to hear your thoughts. We are always making new models and want to know what you think of them. If you have any ideas, please let us know!"

Many newspapers in the UK print pictures that show famous people in private moments. This is against the rules of journalism. Most people who are famous don't want to be in these pictures, but some do. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) is an organization that helps with problems like this. However, it rarely gets involved.
The PCC should look into cases where pictures are taken without permission. These pictures are not important for the public to know. They don't help us learn anything new or keep us safe. 
The PCC should take action when a famous person's private moment is shown in a newspaper. They should also look into stories that are not true. Many famous people are afraid to complain because they think the newspaper will make fun of them. 
It's hard to find a solution to this problem. The PCC has a big job to do, but it's hard for them to keep track of all the newspapers in the UK. Famous people might not want to complain because they don't want more attention.

Many people get advice on what to do after college. This article is about moving to a new job. We're not talking about people who are looking for a temporary job while they find a permanent one, or those who leave a job after a few weeks because they're not happy. Instead, we're talking about people who have already learned and gained some skills, and are now looking for a job that fits with their long-term plans.
What kind of job should you look for? It depends on what you want to achieve. Do you want to specialize in a certain field, work your way up to more responsibility, or move into a new area? Whatever you decide, you should choose your new job carefully. You should stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job, as it shows you're serious about your career.
It's also a good time to travel if you want to. You can do temporary work when you get back and then find a new job. Employers will be happy to see that you've had an adventure and won't be likely to leave again.

E Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and was too afraid to speak up in meetings. But I learned to speak my mind.

If a kite breaks, the person who finds it gets to keep it. Adnan had many more kites at his feet. We sat down with the kites under some trees and watched the festival.

Little Chefs is a cooking class for kids between 10 and 15 years old. They learn how to cook in small groups on Saturdays. Many kids want to join the class, so there's a waiting list. Parents pay £280 for the course. The kids have fun and learn how to make good food.
One of the students, Bill, is 10 years old. He loves his mom's cooking and now he can make it better than her. The teachers make the class fun and everyone laughs together when they eat the food they made.
Flora is 12 years old and loves cooking. She made a meal for her friends and they all liked it. Her mom suggested she take up cooking as a hobby instead of staying at home all the time. Flora was a bit hesitant at first, but she's glad she joined the class.
Their teacher, Philippe, says it's a great class. Kids pay attention and remember things better than adults. Sometimes the kitchen gets messy when they're cooking, but that's okay. Philippe thinks it's important for kids to learn how to cook when they're young so they can make their own food when they grow up.

What is money? Money is like a special ticket that you can use to buy things. It's like a ticket to a show or a bus ticket. The difference is that you can use money to buy many different things, like a book, some candy, or a movie ticket. But the money itself is just a piece of paper or a coin, and it doesn't cost much to make.
A long time ago, people didn't have money like we do now. They didn't have banks or stores. Instead, people would trade things with each other. For example, a farmer might give some food to a beekeeper in exchange for some honey. This was a special agreement between two people, where each person had something the other wanted.
Later, many societies created their own special money so that people could trade more easily. This is why we have different kinds of money, like dollars or pounds. And now, most countries have their own special money that people use."

Hypatia was a very important scientist who lived a long time ago, in 370 AD. She was the only woman scientist to be remembered in history books for a long time. Her father was the head of a big school in Alexandria, Egypt. He made sure she had a good education, which was unusual because most women didn't have the chance to study back then. Hypatia went to school in Athens and Rome and then came back to Alexandria to teach mathematics. She became famous for knowing new ideas and wrote some important books about math. She was also good at inventing things to help her work. At that time, some rulers were scared of science and people who worked with it were in danger. Sadly, one day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.

'Grass is very good at surviving. There are many different kinds of grass, over 9,000! You can find grass everywhere on Earth. Grass can even grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctica. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to live. Grass is very good at growing back quickly. It's special because new leaves grow from the roots, not from the top of the plant. This means that many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, there's always more growing back soon.'

Kal has always loved drawing and designing clothes. When she was a child, she would draw clothes and patterns. But she didn't tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make a career out of it. She thought they wanted her to work in a big company, so she went to university to study business. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She liked attending fashion events, but she couldn't afford the expensive clothes she liked. So, she started making her own clothes. Her friends liked them, and they asked her to make more. She found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs. They were very popular, and nothing came back. This made her decide to leave her job and start her own fashion label. Her parents were surprised but supportive, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes over £500,000 a year. She designs clothes for famous people and has even been featured in fashion magazines.

'The Ghan Train: A Journey Across Australia
I took a train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train goes from the warm north to the cold south, crossing the Australian continent. It's a long journey, but not a fast one. The train is famous for being late, but it's still a great way to see Australia.
A long time ago, people wanted to build a train line from Adelaide to Darwin. They finished building it a few months before I took the trip. The train can go up to 115 kilometers per hour, but it's not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most people on the train are on holiday.
The train was originally built to carry goods, not people. It was thought to be a faster and cheaper way to send goods from Europe to Australia's southern cities. The Ghan is the first train to go from north to south across a continent. I was excited to take the trip with other travelers, including many Australian pensioners.
We stopped at Katherine, where some people got off to take a boat trip. I stayed on the train and went to Alice Springs with a group of passengers. We took a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, some people got off the train and others continued their journey to Adelaide.
The view from the train after Alice Springs was not very exciting - just flat land with cows. But on the third day, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean, and my journey was over. Although the train didn't always live up to its promises, it took me to some amazing places in Australia.'"

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis, a big mountain in Scotland. It's very cold there because it's in the north. Climber Keith Hewitt went on a big winter climb to the top of Ben Nevis. They went up the north side of the mountain to a place called Tower Ridge. It's a long way up - 600 metres. They planned to stay in special places called 'Carries' halfway up the mountain. They brought tents, sleeping bags, and special spikes for their boots because the snow was very hard.
The weather was good, but some people were a little nervous. Ben Nevis is always a big challenge in winter. The path went up quickly and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest one in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others would stop and wait for me, but then they would start moving again. I promised myself to train better before climbing next time.
After 200 metres, we reached the beginning of Tower Ridge. It's very narrow - only 1.5 metres wide. The mountain drops down very steeply on both sides. We had to be very careful and take our time. It took us 7 hours to reach the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and even a distant island. But it was misty when we were there.
Going down the mountain can be just as hard as going up. We had to use a map to find our way back to camp. One wrong turn could be dangerous in the winter. I was glad we took turns doing this job. When I was safe in my tent, I finally felt happy about the experience. But I was relieved to have made it to the top.'"

Now we have five big classrooms. We also have a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. We're waiting for our new sports field to be ready. When you enter the school, you'll notice it's warm inside because our body heat keeps it warm. The building is designed to keep the sound inside too. If we sing in class, it sounds like a concert hall! You'll also see a tree on the roof. The builders put it there because it's a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The school gets its electricity from a big wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher and took pictures. There are still some things to add to the school, like a new stage for our play. We're very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn faster now that we're here!"""

THE ICEHOTEL
For a long time, people went to the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. In the winter, it was very cold and dark, and only a few people lived there. But in the 1980s, people thought, ""Why not use the cold and dark winter to do something special?"" In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit built an igloo in a small town called Jukkasjarvi. Many people came to visit and saw his art. One night, some guests had the idea to sleep in the igloo. They were very happy and thought, ""Why not build a hotel made of ice and snow?"" Now, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world.
Every year, a team of builders, architects, and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They work on different parts of the hotel, and each part is finished and opened to visitors and guests. The hotel is built outside, so it depends on the weather. In the spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, it is always between -5°C and -8°C, but you don't need to worry about it being too cold. You can wear warm clothes, like a hat, gloves, and a scarf. You can even buy these things on the ICEHOTEL website when you book your visit.
The hotel is in a village called Jukkasjarvi, near the Arctic Circle. You can get there by bus from the airport or train station."

Tanya Streeter is a world champion free-diver. She can swim deep into the ocean without breathing and then come back up to the surface. In 2003, she became the first person to dive 120 meters deep without breathing and come back up without help. She had tried it before, but that time she used a balloon to help her come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which is a record.
Tanya thinks that safety is very important in free-diving. She trains hard and has a team of safety divers watching her when she dives. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya says it's worth it.
Tanya trains in different ways. She goes to the gym, swims in the pool, and exercises on a bike to make her heart strong. She doesn't run because she doesn't want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks quickly to get fit.
When Tanya is getting ready for a big event, she goes away for a few weeks and does 14 dives. She needs to be careful not to get tired. When she's not training, she travels around to talk about sports and help environmental organizations. She loves her job.
Tanya grew up on a Caribbean island and loved swimming and exploring the ocean. She says her life is like her childhood dreams. She wants to keep breaking her own records and is not planning to stop free-diving for many years.

""Honey is a sweet liquid that bees make. It's made from water and sugar. Bees fly a long way - as far as 75,000 kilometers - and visit many flowers to make just a little honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower it comes from. There are over 300 kinds of honey. Light honey is usually milder than dark honey.
A long time ago, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians loved honey and used it as money. Today, people make and eat honey all around the world. Honey is good for you too - it can help you feel less tired and do better in sports. But honey is not just for eating - it can also help with sore throats and is used in some beauty products.""

Norwich is a city in the east of England. It has been a place where people live for over 2,000 years. A long time ago, it was a small village near a river. In 1066, when the Normans came to England, Norwich became a big town. Today, it's a city with two big churches and a mosque. People from different religions come to visit and live here.
A long time ago, Norwich was a very important city. In the 16th century, it was the second biggest city in England. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but Norwich is still a great place to live. The city has a university and many shops, restaurants, and entertainment places. There's even a football team called 'The Canaries', but nobody knows why they're called that!
In recent years, Norwich has built a new shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. The city centre was dug up to make a big park with water and trees. People are happy that the old market is still here, right in the middle of the city. The market and the new shopping centre work well together, showing that Norwich can mix old and new things.

The Albuquerque Balloon Festival
Every year, the city of Albuquerque in the United States has a big festival with many colorful hot-air balloons. The festival started in 1972 and has grown bigger and bigger. This year, over 1,000 balloons from many countries will come to the festival.
What to see and do
You can see the balloons at night when they light up their burners at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow"" and is a great time to take pictures. But you need to arrive early or late to see this.
During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots. The balloons come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even shaped like animals or cartoon characters. Kids will love it!
You can also take a balloon ride over the desert or ride a cable car to the top of the nearby mountains for a great view of the festival. There are also balloon races and fireworks on some evenings.
Tips
Buy your tickets online to avoid waiting in line. Wear layers of clothing because it can be cool at night and hot during the day. Bring a flashlight for night events, a camera, and sunscreen. If you're not digital, bring high-speed film for night pictures.

Most of the book is fiction, like parts of novels and short stories. There are some good pieces by famous writers. It's interesting that some writers who are not very well-known wrote about food. I recommend reading Jane Harris' story 'Those Nails' before you eat, because it has some unpleasant scenes that might make you feel sick. There are also good poems by 19 poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. The book also includes parts of novels that are still being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Additionally, there is a funny article about newspapers by Alan Rusbridger and a surprising piece about Ursula Owen. This book is very good, and I'm excited to see what next year's book will be like."""

""Starting to learn the violin is best when you're between three and six years old,"" says Margaret Porter, a violin teacher. ""This is a good age because you're still learning about the world."" Margaret likes teaching three- and four-year-olds, but she also teaches five-year-olds if they're very interested. When she started teaching in 1972, her first students were her friends' five-year-old kids.
Margaret's students have group lessons with about 10-12 other kids. Each lesson is one hour, and they meet every two weeks. They also have one special lesson with Margaret just for themselves, once a week. Parents need to come to the lessons too. It's important for parents to be involved and help their kids learn.
From the very beginning, students learn to play the violin by listening and imitating. They don't learn to read music until they've been playing for a few years. For a long time, there might be a big difference between how well they play and how well they read music. Margaret says her way of teaching isn't meant to make great violinists. If a student is very good, she suggests they leave and learn the traditional way."

'Moonshine's new CD is out! It's their third one, and it's called ""Here Again"". This is a follow-up to their previous CD, ""The Waves"". There are some new members in the band. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, and Tom Simpson is on drums. The first two songs on the CD are fast and fun to dance to. The rest of the CD is more like their usual style, slow and calm. These two new songs might surprise some fans, but they're really good and could be big hits! The singer, Rob Letchford, does a great job singing them. He had to record them before he got sick and had to cancel the band's next tour. Don't worry if you bought tickets, the concerts will be rescheduled when Rob is better. ""Here Again"" is a great CD that shows the band can make many different kinds of music. It's a mix of slow and fast songs that will make you want to dance or relax. The first and last songs are the best, but overall, this CD is sure to be a big success for Moonshine.'"

'History of Shoes
A long time ago, people didn't care about shoes being comfortable or fashionable. They wore animal skins around their ankles to keep warm. We still use leather today, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton. It's only been 150 years since people started wearing a different shoe on each foot. Before that, people wore the same kind of shoe on both feet. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now most shoes are made in big factories using machines. The invention of sewing machines helped the shoe industry make more shoes at a lower price for more people.'

I put up posters and 40 women joined. They were all interested in losing weight, but they didn't know much about running. They thought it would be hard and painful. But I wanted to show them that running can be fun! We run in nice places, like by a river, and we chat and smile. At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned about healthy eating and exercise from other runners.

'A LONG TIME AGO, PEOPLE CAME TO ALASKA TO FIND GOLD. They built a town called Iditarod. It grew very quickly and became the biggest city in Alaska. But in the winter, it was hard to get supplies to the town because the rivers and ocean were frozen. So, people used dog teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to the miners. The dogs pulled sleds along a special trail called the Iditarod Trail. It took them three weeks to travel across Alaska.
In the winter, the dog teams would stop at special houses where the drivers could rest and eat. The trail was used for many years until airplanes became popular. But in 1925, a big problem happened. A disease called diphtheria came to the town of Nome. The medicine to cure the disease was in Anchorage, but it was too far away. The only way to get it was by using dog teams. Twenty teams of dogs worked together to bring the medicine to Nome. They followed the Iditarod Trail and took only six days to complete the journey. A dog named Togo helped guide the team, and another dog named Balto saved the team from danger. Balto became a hero.
Now, every year, people hold a dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome, following the same route as the famous journey in 1925. It's called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth"".'"

Welcome to Antarctica Sightseeing Flights! We take tourists on a special trip over Antarctica in a big plane from Sydney, Australia. We don't know the exact dates for next year yet, but if you book now, your money is safe if we change the date.
Frequently Asked Questions:
How long is the flight? The flight is about 12 hours. We usually see ice and icebergs after four hours. We spend four hours over Antarctica and then fly back to Sydney.
What do I do on the flight? On the way to and from Antarctica, experts talk to us about the environment and history. You can also ask them questions. There's a special camera that shows us what the pilot sees from the cockpit.
Can I sit by the window? Everyone gets two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you switch seats to get a better view. Business and first class passengers sit by the window for half the flight, and economy passengers sit by the window or near the window for half the flight.
What if the weather is bad? Our captain looks at the weather forecast and chooses the best route for a clear view.
Can I see penguins and other animals? We don't see them from the plane because they live at sea level, which is too far down. We don't land on Antarctica for environmental reasons. To see animals, you need to go on a boat tour.
Can I take pictures? Yes, you can take all the photos you want! We even have fun activities where you can wear special cold-weather clothes like the ones Antarctic explorers wear.

'Winter driving can be very dangerous. It's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly, and ice can be hidden under the snow. Cars can also slide across the road. To stay safe, remember two important rules.
First, drive smoothly. Don't make sudden movements like turning the wheel, pressing the brakes, or speeding up. This will help you control your car. Imagine you have a cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive slowly and carefully so you don't spill it.
Second, be aware of what might happen. When there's a lot of ice, look far ahead on the road. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be going faster than you think. Always leave more space between you and the car in front, especially on wet, snowy, or icy roads. Try to stay in control of your car, and you will be safe.'

Craigie Aitchison was a Scottish painter. He went to art school in London instead of studying law. He didn't like the traditional drawing classes, but he kept painting. When he was in his late 20s, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. He does this by painting thin layers of color, one on top of the other, from light to dark. He doesn't know what the final result will be. He says, ""It's a secret because I don't know myself.""
Aitchison thinks that anyone can make good colors because you can buy them. He notices what colors look good together. He doesn't make sketches before he starts painting. He thinks if he does, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he prefers to paint people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting. If they get worried and want to look at the painting, he can't focus.
Aitchison moved to London many years ago and doesn't feel connected to the Scottish art scene. He doesn't care about following traditional art styles; he just paints the way he wants to. Despite this, his work still inspires young British artists.

He drove it for 1,500 kilometers and then sold it. He built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He made cars using strong but light steel, so they were cheap and easy for people to buy. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model T. It cost $825. Many people bought it. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Henry Ford's early cars were simple and cheap, but that meant there were fewer choices.
