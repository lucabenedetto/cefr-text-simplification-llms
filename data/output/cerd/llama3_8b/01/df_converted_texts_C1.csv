Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

Charging families for their trash seems like a good idea: it's environmentally friendly and economically sensible. But is it really? In many developed countries, people throw away a lot of rubbish without paying for it. This is a problem because the more rubbish we produce, the more it costs to collect and dispose of it. Economists think that if we have to pay for our trash, we'll produce less and recycle more. To test this idea, some towns in the US started charging households for their waste. In one town, Charlottesville, Virginia, residents were charged 80 cents for each bag of rubbish. The result? People threw away less rubbish, but not as much as expected. In fact, they just crammed more garbage into each bag, which isn't very efficient. The weight of the rubbish collected didn't change much, and some people even started dumping their trash illegally. The only positive outcome was that more people recycled, but this might have been because they were already doing it voluntarily. A more recent study found that increasing the price of rubbish bags only reduced the amount of waste by a small amount. So, is charging for rubbish a good idea? It's not that simple. The effects of such policies can be complex, and we need to consider many factors to understand them.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Many people are unhappy with their jobs. They feel undervalued and unappreciated. It's not enough to just be good at your job. You need to enjoy it and feel fulfilled. Work should be a way to develop as a person, not just a means to earn a living. 

In the past, people were happy with their jobs because they loved what they did. However, now people are looking for more. They want their work to bring them personal growth, wisdom, and a sense of purpose. 

Some jobs, like medicine and accounting, are often seen as prestigious, but even in these fields, people are unhappy. Doctors are stressed, and accountants question the ethics of their profession. Architects and administrators often feel trapped in their roles. 

The concept of ""work"" needs to be rethought. It's not just about earning a living; it's about being fulfilled as a person. We need to ask ourselves what our jobs do to us, to our minds, and to our relationships. 

For example, hotel workers are often underappreciated and overworked. They are intelligent and lively people who deserve better. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds come together. 

Work should be a relationship, not just a job. People should be given the chance to design their own jobs and choose their own colleagues and customers. This means learning to communicate across different boundaries and having meaningful conversations. 

These conversations are essential for building respect and equality. When we have conversations that go beyond just exchanging information, we can change the world in small but significant ways.<|eot_id|>"

""BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

The term 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds widely, by hand. It's not just an agricultural metaphor, but also a symbol of optimistic modernism. It implies planned growth, spreading information to a wide audience. The metaphor assumes a centralised source, like a bucket of seeds, which is intended to spread and reproduce. So, why did a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically adopt this metaphor? Since television is related to other two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, it's surprising that it was initially designed as a centralised medium.

In the early days of television, it was seen as a way to transmit information to private homes from a central location. This fits with the social and economic structures of modern societies. Experiments with alternative forms of organisation, like two-way television, were tried in the 1930s, but they didn't succeed.

In the UK, amateur radio enthusiasts experimented with television transmission, but big business and government intervened, setting standards and regulations that made it difficult for these grassroots initiatives to continue. Similarly, in the US, television was initially seen as a potential competitor to the film industry.

Television was often watched in public settings, especially in the UK and Germany. While there were alternative visions for television, like grass-roots, two-way communication, these ideas were ultimately unsuccessful. Manufacturers focused on selling domestic sets, and the idea of centralised broadcasting to a dispersed audience became the dominant model.

The rise of consumer society and improved living standards in the 1920s and 1930s made it possible for people to have TVs in their homes. This reinforced the idea of centralised broadcasting. The relationship between social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting is clear. As societies became more modern, broadcasting became a way for governments to reach citizens efficiently and for the media to shape the 'imagined community' of the nation-state.

However, the role of broadcasting in promoting democracy and equal access to information is often overlooked. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the wars, the importance of broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources for informed participation in politics, society, and culture was a key consideration. As television evolves, the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated, and this metaphor will be seen as a relic of a particular phase of social modernisation.""

It's natural to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes our desire for possessions gets out of control. Advertisers often use tactics that play on our insecurities, making us feel like we need certain products to be happy. To see how much advertising influences us, try avoiding billboards and advertisements next time you're out. These messages are designed to be persuasive and can affect us without us even realizing it. We're constantly bombarded with ads on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and online, all encouraging us to buy more.

Research on caves has been ongoing for years, with scientists studying their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a fascinating part of the natural world, and people have been interested in them for a long time.

Weather forecasting has a long history, dating back to the 17th century. Originally, people used their senses to observe the weather, and today we have advanced technology like satellites and computers to help us predict the weather.

'Music and Theatre: A New Perspective

I used to think that opera is primarily a form of theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first. This is as it should be. I come from a world where the spoken word and the actor are central, where the audience and performers share a common language. In contrast, music performances often have a significant minority of people who are not familiar with music theory or academic music. These people may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, but they are often impressed by the performers' skills. A good musician is the result of years of hard work, and it's easy to appreciate their talent.

Theatre audiences have different expectations than music audiences. They don't fully understand the skill involved in acting and are not necessarily impressed by an actor's ability to deliver a long and difficult speech. On the other hand, music audiences are often awestruck by the technical skills of the performers.

I believe that music can learn from theatre in terms of the relationship between the audience and the performers. In theatre, the audience and performers meet on more equal terms, regardless of the complexity of the material. This is not always the case in music, where the audience and performers are often separated by a hierarchical structure.

Music performances can be theatrical, with elements of passion, humor, and grandeur. However, the conventions that dominate music presentation, such as strict dress codes and deference to conductors and soloists, can create a sense of hierarchy between the performers and the audience. Additionally, the tendency to applaud between movements or after a virtuosic performance can disrupt the flow of the performance.

There are efforts underway to encourage new audiences to attend concerts and opera performances, and to break down barriers that make people feel that classical music is not for them. I have seen a remarkable community opera performance that was a life-changing experience for many in the audience. What I would like to see in music is a bit more of the risk-taking and radicalism that theatre can display. This can come from using unconventional locations, which can have a profound impact on both the performers and the audience.

As someone who loves and appreciates both theatre and music, I believe that both art forms can thrive and benefit from each other. I hope that music can learn from the theatre's ability to create a sense of community and connection between the audience and performers.'<|eot_id|>"

I'm not a fan of sand in its natural state. It's a barrier that gets in the way and makes a mess. When you're at the beach, it blows in your face, gets in your food, and even swallows small objects. When it's wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you leave the beach, it seems to disappear. However, it can still cause problems when you're indoors. Sand can be a real nuisance.

The need for a safe and secure home has been around since humans first built permanent homes. People want to feel safe and protected from outsiders. This is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have developed electronic locking systems, but people still prefer traditional locks with physical keys. One company even added a physical key to their electronic system.

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern art gallery because I don't always understand modern art. I like some pieces, such as sculptures and photographs, but I don't have a deep understanding of the art world. The gallery's approach is to let the art speak for itself, without trying to analyze it too much. However, this approach didn't work for me. The new gallery has taken a different approach, providing clear labels that explain the context and meaning behind each piece. This has helped me understand the art better.

Adapting novels into films often involves cutting out parts of the story, characters, and dialogue. This process can be frustrating for writers, but it's also an opportunity to see what's truly essential to the story. When working on a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and description without losing the main point. This doesn't mean the original dialogue and description were unnecessary, but rather that they served different purposes in the novel and film.

In novels, we need more information to understand characters and settings, so authors include more details. In films, the audience can infer some of this information from the visuals and action, so less is needed. Speech tags, like ""he said,"" are also used more in novels to help readers follow the conversation.

Films can transport us to another world, making us feel like we're part of the story. This can be a powerful experience, but it's temporary. Once the movie ends, we return to our everyday reality. Some people may not take films seriously, viewing them as mere entertainment rather than art.

The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing place, with many small rooms and no clear entrance. It was easy to get lost, but employees knew their way around. The studios were the hub of romance and adventure, where people could escape their daily worries for a few hours.

Many people want to make movies, and there are plenty of resources available to help them. Bookstores are filled with books on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Even with limited resources, some filmmakers have achieved success, like Robert Rodriguez, who made a film for just $7,000. His story is an inspiration to many aspiring filmmakers.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to work their way up the ranks, learning their craft behind the scenes. They might start by working on low-budget films or as editors. Now, with the decline of studios and television, aspiring filmmakers must be more independent and take risks.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

In the past, the council houses in the western part of the city were lined up row after row. They were small, drab houses made of orange brick or pale stucco. In the summer, the smell of chemicals from a nearby factory would waft through the air, making it difficult to breathe. Many people didn't like this smell.

I don't remember much about my childhood, but I do recall sitting on a windowsill, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. I also remember my mother, who was a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, and I couldn't do anything to make her happy.

As a child, I would accompany my mother to the local shops or on longer trips into the city. I think I understood that my mother was a bit strange, even back then. She was very solitary, and she liked things to be proper. This meant following strict rules, such as not walking in other people's gardens or disturbing their flowers.

My mother had a few friends, but they were all a bit strange too. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the royal family, Mrs. Winall, who barely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was a bit more lively but whom the others didn't really like. I later realized that these women were all unhappy and miserable, and they would often talk about their problems, including their health issues and their difficult children.

Looking back, it seems like a heavy burden was placed on my shoulders, with the council houses, my mother, and her friends all weighing me down. It was my job to grow up and break free from this weight. But it wasn't easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until I was five, I just stayed at home and got under my parents' feet. Then, when I turned five, I started going to school.

I remember the summer holidays, when I would catch glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man who lived next door to Mrs. Buddery and would tell stories about his time at sea. There was also a charity fair once, where a kind woman gave me lemonade and tried to get me interested in a charity for children. But my mother wouldn't let me join, saying the organizers were only after our money.

My mother didn't like politicians, and she thought they were all corrupt. If she thought about the House of Commons, she saw it as a place where rich people got richer by taking money from the government. I may be exaggerating, but I think that's how she saw it.

Despite all her flaws, my mother did try to educate me. On Sundays, she would take me on the bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through the rooms, looking at paintings by local artists. My mother wasn't completely against this, and eventually, she started to form opinions about the art. I remember one time when she stopped in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and said, ""I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was the only time I remember her trying to make a joke.<|eot_id|>"

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with humidity, making my walk feel more secretive. I knew this side of the street from my childhood. There were familiar houses, like the Matzes', the Pritchards', and Han Kieffer's grocery store. I used to play with my friends, all girls, at the houses with low porches and small front yards. Over time, some houses became stores, and some stores turned into homes. I wondered how people lived in those spaces, surrounded by the smells of old merchandise.

I visited Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer who lives in a former curtain warehouse. He wanted a cozy space, not an open-plan loft. He created a barrier with a corrugated plastic sheet to separate his office from the living area. He chose a light wood floor to balance the industrial look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen. His furniture is a mix of modern and sentimental pieces, given to him by his parents or bought from markets.

Bruce Chatwin was a famous writer known for his romantic and adventurous spirit. His book ""In Patagonia"" is a classic of travel writing. It's a mix of fact and fiction, with vivid descriptions of people and places. Chatwin's writing style was unique, and his books often explored the idea that travel can reveal hidden histories and secrets.

I used to swim in my backyard pool during heavy rainstorms. The rain would create a misty atmosphere, and I loved the feeling of swimming through the water, surrounded by the sounds of the storm. One summer, the idea of swimming through Britain from the sea to the sea began to form. I wanted to escape the routine of swimming laps and explore the country's hidden places.

Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But activities like walking, cycling, and swimming allow us to experience the world in a more authentic way, by leaving the beaten path and discovering the unknown. A long swim through Britain would give me a chance to explore the uncharted parts of our world, like the mystery of the unknown.<|eot_id|>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans crying had no purpose. However, scientists have found that crying plays a significant social role. For example, a psychiatrist named John Bowlby discovered that crying helps develop the bond between a mother and child. Many people believe that children cry because they feel helpless. But why do adults still cry? The sound of crying is less important than the visual signal it sends. It's possible that crying helped early human communities build trust and feel connected. We may cry to show sympathy for those who are suffering unfairly. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear beautiful music or a moving speech. We may also cry when watching a sad movie, but this is more likely to happen when we're with others. The social importance of crying is clear, but researchers are still studying this topic.

Global warming is a well-known issue, but we're still unsure about its consequences. A warmer climate will bring changes to the weather all over the world. Since the atmosphere affects every part of our planet, any changes will have significant effects on plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support our population. Any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.

We're not sure exactly how the world will change, but we do know that human actions have increased the concentration of certain gases in the atmosphere over the past 100 years. These gases are linked to global temperature, and it's likely that they're already affecting the climate. However, our understanding of the global heat balance is limited, making it difficult to predict the future.

Scientists use computer models to predict the effects of global warming. These models are based on physical and chemical laws, but they're simplifications of the real world and have limitations. Despite these limitations, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we've experienced before.

The predictions suggest that the average global temperature will rise by 1-3.5°C by 2100, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts will become more frequent in some areas.

Climate change will affect the natural environment and human societies. It could alter the locations of ecosystems, the mix of species, and their ability to provide benefits to humans. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some areas will be more affected than others, and some changes will be irreversible.

However, not all effects will be negative. In some regions, climate change has already led to beneficial trends, such as increased wheat production in Australia due to warmer temperatures. But many predicted effects will be unfavorable, including changes to water availability, which could lead to droughts and shortages in arid and semi-arid regions.

Climate change will also affect glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost, which will impact vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human infrastructure. The melting of Arctic ice could lead to increased danger from icebergs and make marine transport and oil exploration easier.

The most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels, caused by the expansion of warmer ocean water and the melting of ice. This will lead to increased flooding and inundation, affecting many coastal cities and displacing millions of people. The consequences will be severe, with entire countries potentially ceasing to exist if worst-case scenarios occur.<|eot_id|>"

The concept of aesthetics is often hindered by the very existence of works of art. This is because these works are physical objects that exist independently of human experience. As a result, people tend to focus on the object itself rather than its impact on human experience. Additionally, the perfection and prestige of some works of art can create conventions that make it difficult to gain new insights. When a work of art becomes a classic, it is often isolated from its original context and the experiences it evokes in people's lives. This isolation creates a barrier that makes it hard to understand the significance of the work.

Art should be connected to the everyday experiences and events that people encounter in their daily lives. Theorists and critics often separate art from these everyday experiences, which can lead to a misunderstanding of its significance. To truly understand art, we need to consider the conditions and forces that shape human experience, just like geographers and geologists study the earth.

To understand the meaning of artistic products, we need to step back and look at the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we usually don't associate with aesthetics. This requires a detour, but it's necessary to gain insight and understanding. We can enjoy art without knowing its theoretical background, but to truly understand it, we need to consider the interactions and conditions that shape it.

Many people enjoy activities like movies, jazz, and comic strips, which are often not considered ""art"" in the classical sense. However, these activities share the same qualities that make art enjoyable. The problem lies in the separation of art from everyday experience, which is often perpetuated by theorists and critics. When art is connected to everyday life, people tend to appreciate it more.

Observing Lions

Lions are often seen as amazing hunters. They work together to catch their prey, moving like a well-rehearsed team. However, after studying lions in the wild for many years, we have a more realistic view. We wanted to know why lions hunt together, care for their cubs, and scare off rivals. If an animal's success is measured by how many offspring it has, then cooperation doesn't always pay. So, why do lions still work together? We thought we would find the answer in just a few years, but lions are very good at doing nothing. It took us a long time to figure out their behavior because they can live up to 18 years in the wild.

The answer to our questions is only now becoming clear. Lions are not just hunting machines; they have a complex social structure. They have a hierarchy, and each lion has a specific role. They also have a strong sense of community and work together to protect their territory and family.

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends, as cooking wasn't considered a prestigious career. Chefs have a tough job, working long hours under pressure, and are often poorly paid. But I wasn't deterred. I was unhappy at university, finding the work hard and the social scene self-important. Cooking seemed like a refreshing change. It promised a sense of purpose and integrity that was lacking in my college life.

My interest in cooking wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It was also driven by an aesthetic ideal. I had a memorable meal at a famous London restaurant that left a lasting impression on me. The food was incredible, and I felt warm and content for days afterwards. After that, I became determined to learn the secrets of cooking. I stopped focusing on my history degree and instead spent my free time reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and preparing elaborate meals.

I also learned how to dive, which was a challenging but exhilarating experience. My instructor was strict and demanding, but I enjoyed the sense of freedom and accomplishment I felt when I finally mastered the technique.

Summer is a great time to escape and read. We can find books that help us feel more connected to the world. Reading can make us feel less alone because we can relate to the experiences and thoughts of others. Authors can express our own feelings and thoughts in a way that we can't. When we read, our minds become more open, and we start to notice things we wouldn't have noticed before. We feel grateful to authors for reminding us of who we are.

Reading and traveling can help us break free from routine. When we're in a new place, our senses are more alert, and we notice things we wouldn't have noticed before. When we're reading a great book, we're transported to a new world and become more aware of our surroundings.

Fashion has often been seen as a modern phenomenon, but it actually has a long history. Historians of fashion point out that fashion, in the sense of style and design, has been around for a long time. They often start their story with the development of the market and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies became more complex, people needed more clothes and ways to make them, so the meanings of clothes and accessories became more complicated. Today, it's hard to say exactly what an item of clothing means, as its meaning can change depending on the context and who is looking at it.

For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people in different situations. Similarly, the idea of what it's like to be a novelist is often exaggerated in the media. In reality, most writers have to work multiple jobs to make a living, and many have to teach, write articles, and do other odd jobs to support themselves. I've even heard of writers who work for chocolate companies! Despite the challenges, writers find ways to make ends meet and keep writing.

Sudden Fame

We were playing at small venues all over the country and they were selling out fast. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being mobbed by fans. When we weren't working, we couldn't even leave the house without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our movements were watched by our fans, and our needs were taken care of by our management and others. Although I was still shy, I felt a strange sense of confidence that only comes from being thrust into the spotlight. Overall, I was overwhelmed and out of my depth.<|eot_id|>"

Music in the 21st Century

The way we experience music is changing rapidly due to technological advancements. In the past, we had more opportunities to listen to music through various media such as radio, TV, records, and CDs. However, this has led to a decline in live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for professional musicians.

Despite this, music remains an essential part of our lives. It is often present at national events and provides individuals with various activities, both formal and informal. In fact, it is hard to imagine a society without music.

The music industry is a significant contributor to the UK's economy, and musical skills will continue to be valuable in various professions, particularly those related to the media. Research has also shown that playing a musical instrument can have a positive impact on cognitive development, particularly in spatial reasoning and social skills.

In the future, there may be a shift in the types of music we listen to, with new genres emerging that blend different styles. Technology will also play a larger role in music composition and performance, making it more accessible to people. However, this may lead to a decline in the need for live performances and musicians who specialize in this area.

To prepare for these changes, music education will need to adapt. Instrumental teaching will need to focus on teaching people of all ages to play a range of instruments, and the curriculum will need to encompass a broader range of musical skills. Music teachers will also need to develop new skills, such as communication, social, and entrepreneurial skills, to work with diverse groups and communities.

Ultimately, it is essential to promote the value of music in our lives and ensure that it is recognized as a vital part of our culture. Those involved in the music profession need to work together to raise the profile of music and demonstrate the high quality of music education available.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

Actors often face criticism and scorn. Sometimes, they themselves contribute to this by talking about their craft and themselves in interviews. They should remember the words of the famous dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, they often use clichés or get caught up in gossip. 

Paul Scofield, a renowned actor, once wrote that an actor's work has value only when it is being performed. Discussion and theory can make it seem empty and uninteresting. Every time an actor takes on a new role, they start from scratch, learning and growing with each character and playwright. 

Adrian Lester's performance in Hamlet is a great example of this. He skillfully navigates the character's emotional journey, moving seamlessly from youth to adulthood. His physical and emotional control are impressive, and he brings a sense of humor and wit to the role. 

So, what is acting? Is it an imitation or an evocation of real-life behavior? Who or what animates the actors' bodies? This is the central question of the theatre.

One director's approach to rehearsal is to focus on the emotions and impulses behind the words. He encourages actors to let their thoughts and feelings guide their performances, rather than planning and judging every detail. This way, they can discover new things and grow as actors.

The perfect theatre experience should make you feel like your presence matters. The staff should be passionate about their work, and the auditorium should be designed to bring the audience and performers together. The proportions of the auditorium are crucial, as they should respond to the human voice and body. A well-designed auditorium can create a sense of connection and intimacy between the audience and the stage.

Not every play can appeal to everyone, and it's impossible to predict what audiences will want to see. When we go to the theatre, we want to be surprised and delighted, otherwise, we might as well stay at home.<|eot_id|>"

Paul Simon and other young people in the 1950s were fascinated by rock and roll music. It wasn't just a youth movement, but it also changed the way the middle class and older people listened to music. Rock and roll paved the way for new generations of musicians, who were inspired by its unique sound. For Paul Simon, the opportunity to listen to this new music came from a popular radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, hosted by Alan Freed. This show was a must-listen for many young musicians, including John Lennon, who was listening to it from Liverpool. Paul Simon was captivated by the music and wanted to make his own. He didn't know how to get started, but he felt he could figure it out with some caution.

The next part of the text is about a personal experience of the author, which is not directly related to the topic of rock and roll or research. It can be removed or summarized to keep the text focused on the main topic.

As for the qualitative research passage, here is a simplified version:

Qualitative research is a type of research that involves collecting and analyzing non-numerical data. Many books have been written about collecting data, but there is less information available on how to analyze it. We invited experienced social scientists to share their approaches to data analysis, not to create a step-by-step guide, but to provide insight into the process. This involved making implicit procedures more explicit, which was not an easy task. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing.

Recently, I noticed my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur, just like he had seen on TV. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, and he didn't know much. This made me think about whether learning from screens is effective. One writer tried an interactive program with his son and found that it wasn't very effective. He said that if his son had spent the same time reading a book, he might have learned more.

Television is a suggestive medium that needs to be guided by teachers or parents. Research shows that learning happens best when there is dialogue and interaction. While technology can be a useful tool, it's still important for children to have formal education.

Hollywood is a famous place in the United States that has grown from a small town to a global center for the film industry. It's a place where people from all over the world come to work and make movies. The town has changed a lot over the years, but it's still a community where people talk about movies and the people who make them.

Photography was invented by artists who wanted to create a lasting record of their surroundings. They found that photography could produce images that were more realistic and detailed than paintings. Some people didn't think photography was an art form, but photographers knew that they had created something new and important.

Book illustration was an important part of children's books in the past. Many books had illustrations, and some were very famous. The illustrations were often done by well-known artists. Today, some of these illustrations are being rediscovered and reevaluated. They are considered important parts of art history and will be exhibited and reprinted in the future.

Blogging: Sharing Your Life with the World

Some people have warned about the dangers of sharing your location and activities online. They say that by telling the world where you are and what you're doing, you're also telling everyone, including people you may not want to meet. This is a reminder that the internet can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it offers many opportunities to share our lives with others and connect with people all over the world. On the other hand, it can also lead to problems and consequences that we may not have anticipated.

In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers, known as bloggers, explored these waters and discovered the potential risks and pitfalls. They shared their experiences, both good and bad, and learned valuable lessons that we can learn from today.

One of these pioneers is Justin Hall, who started blogging in 1994. He shared his life with the world, including his thoughts, feelings, and experiences. He even posted daily updates, which attracted many readers. Hall's approach was to be open and honest, but he also faced challenges and controversies along the way.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being mindful of what she shared online. She wrote about her job and personal life on her blog, but her anonymous colleagues discovered her blog and sent it to her bosses, which led to her being fired. Armstrong eventually restarted her blog and focused on her family, becoming a successful ""mommy blogger.""

These stories teach us that while the internet offers many benefits, we need to be careful about what we share and with whom we share it. We should remember that our online lives are connected to our real lives, and our actions online can have real-world consequences.<|eot_id|>"

Sleep: A Modern Epidemic?

Tiredness has become a common problem in many countries. As people work longer hours and have more responsibilities, they often don't get enough sleep. Research in the US has found that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep deprivation. This has led to a growing interest in sleep and its importance.

One sleep researcher believes that people need more sleep. He says that when people are busy, they tend to cut back on sleep and get up early to avoid rush hour. To test this, he conducted an experiment where he allowed his subjects to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. The results showed that it took them three weeks to adjust to sleeping eight hours a night, indicating a significant improvement in their sleep quality.

The University of Nottingham's sleep research laboratory has also studied sleep patterns. They have investigated how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the dangers of driving while tired. They recruit volunteers by advertising in student newspapers and pay them £5 an hour. The researchers use electrodes to monitor the volunteers' brain activity while they sleep and drive a simulated motorway.

The laboratory has found that people who are sleep-deprived are more likely to fall asleep while driving. In fact, even after just one night without sleep, people can become drowsy and make mistakes. However, drinking two cups of coffee can help keep them alert for at least half an hour.

Despite the importance of sleep, there is still much we don't know about it. We do know that humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle and switch between different stages of unconsciousness. However, the exact functions of sleep are still not fully understood. Some scientists believe that sleep helps to repair body tissue, restore muscles, or rest the brain, but these theories are still unproven.

Interestingly, women tend to sleep for about half an hour longer than men, and older people require less sleep. Some researchers believe that sleep is a way to travel through time without injury, but this is just a theory.

Historically, sleep patterns have varied across cultures. In the past, people in Britain used to have two periods of sleep, known as ""first sleep"" and ""morning sleep"". The poor would often use this time to reflect on their dreams or engage in night-time activities. However, with the introduction of artificial light and the industrial revolution, people began to adopt a more concentrated sleep pattern.

In some non-Western cultures, people still don't have a fixed bedtime and sleep pattern. Instead, they may sleep for a few hours and then wake up again. In some tribal societies, continuous sleep is not possible due to the presence of animals, noise, and the need to supervise the fire and watch out for predators.

Overall, it seems that people all over the world are struggling to get enough sleep.<|eot_id|>"

I'm standing in the Arizona desert, wearing expensive cowboy boots and a cowboy outfit. But I'm not a real cowboy. I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. However, I don't do it anymore because I'm retired. The question is, what do I do now? I thought I had a plan, but it didn't work out. I tried to be a commentator for racing events, but there were too many other retired drivers doing the same job. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't take off.

Being an ""ex"" anything can be depressing. Nobody wants to hear about my racing stories because they usually end in disappointment. I miss the thrill of racing, the speed, and the attention. I miss being famous, even if it was just a little bit. Now, I have too much free time on my hands.

Vancouver has become a popular city for people from all over the world to live in. In the past ten years, hundreds of thousands of people have moved there. The city is known for its mild climate, beautiful surroundings, and good environment. It's also a great place to find a job and continue your education. Many people come to Vancouver for these reasons.

In the evenings, people like to stroll around the city and enjoy the atmosphere. You might hear many different languages being spoken as you walk around. Some people have complained about the rapid growth of new buildings in the city, but it's clear that the influx of new residents and tourists has helped revitalize the city.

In the past, Vancouver was sometimes called ""Terminal City"" because it was a major hub for transportation. Although this name is not as commonly used today, Vancouver is still an important gateway to other places.

Journalists often struggle to write letters, not because they are motivated by money, but because their work requires them to carefully consider the impact of their words. This makes it difficult for them to write spontaneously, like artists who don't think about the effect of their work.

The opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain, with celebrities like soap stars and disc jockeys attending. However, with the rapid growth of supermarkets, it's no longer necessary to invite celebrities to cut the ribbon. Instead, the first customers to enter the store get a small gift, which creates excitement and a sense of competition among the crowd.

The film ""Citizen Kane"" was released in 1941 and received great reviews, but it was not a commercial success at first. It wasn't until it was shown on television that people started to talk about it again. This film is often credited with inspiring people to become filmmakers, and it's surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that he was able to make the film because he didn't know what was or wasn't allowed, so he just went ahead and did it. He had a great team behind him, including the cameraman Gregg Toland and the screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz.

Welles and Mankiewicz came up with the idea of making a film about a newspaper magnate who was similar to William Randolph Hearst. Welles thought this was a great opportunity for him to play the lead role and direct the film at the same time. He threw himself into the project with a lot of energy.

In another part of the text, we see a conversation between Dermot and his wife Carmel. Dermot is planning to go out and play golf, and Carmel is planning to go shopping. They discuss their plans and make sure they are okay with each other.

The second part of the text talks about job titles and how they can cause envy and unrest at work. A recent study found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees think that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Some people would even prefer to have a more ""motivational"" or ""professional"" job title instead of a pay rise. This shows that people are very concerned about their status at work. The truth is that people are not content with being subordinate and want to be recognized for their abilities.

I was in Vienna to take photographs. Photography is not just my job; it's a part of my life. I love capturing the way light falls on a surface and how a single picture can capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. One day, I might take the perfect shot, and that's what keeps me going. I've been lucky enough to have had some success in the past, but I know that you make your own luck - both good and bad.

After a brief period of success, I started working as a freelance photographer. I was in Vienna because I was hired by an Austrian publisher to take pictures for a coffee-table book about four European cities - London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had already done the London shots, and now I was in Vienna to capture the city's beauty in different seasons. I was given a free hand to take the pictures I wanted, and I enjoyed the freedom to explore the city.

The publisher had originally hired an Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, to do the job, but he quit unexpectedly. Instead of finding a new photographer, they offered me the job. I was happy to take it, as I was available and the other photographers were not. I was put up at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city, and I was excited to explore Vienna on my own.

The first day, I took a tram ride around the Ringstrasse to get a feel for the city. The weather was cold and grey, but I was determined to make the most of it. I didn't take any pictures that day, but I was looking forward to the next morning, when I planned to take some shots of the famous Stephansplatz. The snow had fallen overnight, and I knew it would be a great opportunity to capture some magical moments.

As a photographer, I know that a picture is a moment in time. You have to wait for that moment to arrive, and then you have to be ready to capture it. I took my time, looked around, and waited for the moment to reveal itself. And when it did, I was ready to take the shot.<|eot_id|>"

The Hayward Gallery in London has been transformed into a magical place. Instead of a big, flashy show, it's a charming and unique exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is about movement, and this exhibition explores how artists have used movement in their work over the past 60 years. The curator, Guy Brett, has brought together a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films that show how artists have experimented with movement in their work.

The exhibition doesn't have any big explanations or labels, so visitors can discover and make connections on their own. This allows them to appreciate the art without any distractions.

Some people might not be interested in art, but they might enjoy David Hockney's work because it's easy to understand and relatable. However, this doesn't mean his art is not serious or meaningful. Hockney knows his limitations and doesn't pretend to be a great artist. He's happy for others to judge his work in the future.

As a curator, I've seen many exhibitions that try to push a particular idea or trend. I wanted to do the opposite and create a show that celebrates individuality and creativity. I worked with seven artists to create a unique exhibition called ""Window-shopping"". Each artist had their own idea, and they didn't try to fit into a specific theme. The result was a fascinating and thought-provoking show.

When we look at art, we often forget to enjoy the experience because we're too busy analyzing it. Art historians might focus too much on theory and forget about the pleasure of looking at art. However, knowing more about an artwork can actually enhance our enjoyment of it. Pleasure is complex and influenced by our surroundings and values.

'Metals The discovery of metals may have started with a desire to decorate oneself. In the Stone Age, people might have found shiny yellow pebbles while fishing or walking along a river. They would have noticed that these pebbles were different from stones and attractive. This could be how gold was first used by early humans. Because metals are easy to shape, people soon wanted more of them. Copper might have been discovered by accident, and once people realized its value, they searched for ways to extract it from the earth. This led to the development of metalworking, which was an important innovation.

St Ives The weather was terrible as we walked down the cobblestone street to the center of town. The wind was strong, and the sea was crashing against the promenade. The streets were empty, and all the shutters on the houses were closed. We had taken the train to St Ives, but the weather was getting worse. I had promised my friend a nice walk along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire, but now it didn't seem like such a good idea.

Computer Modelling Studying the past is difficult because it's already happened. We can't ask the people who lived in the past what they did or why they did it. Archaeologists can find clues, but we can't test our ideas by experimenting with people who are alive or dead. However, we can use computer models to recreate the past. We can create virtual communities with people who have some of the same needs and abilities as real people. We can set rules for how they behave and see how they react to different situations.'<|eot_id|>"

Vervet Monkeys

In a group of vervet monkeys, a dominant male noticed a strange male approaching from a nearby grove of trees. The stranger was trying to join the group and take over the dominant male's position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the dominant male gave a warning call, similar to the one used to signal the presence of a leopard. The stranger would quickly retreat back to the safety of his own trees.

This tactic worked well until the dominant male made a mistake. He gave the warning call while walking across the open ground, revealing his own position. This made it clear that he was not really warning the group of a leopard.

Cats and Birds

A survey in an English village found that 70 cats caught over 1,000 small animals in a year. This led one professor to estimate that all the cats in Britain kill around 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this is an unrealistic calculation because most cats live in towns and have smaller territories, catching fewer animals than the cats in the survey.

The real question is whether the number of animals caught by cats is sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in the winter, and birds have plenty of places to nest in gardens and buildings. This means that the bird population is kept at a high level.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 level learner:

Photography has been used to capture various aspects of human life and activity for over a century and a half. During this time, photography has become more advanced in recording time and space, allowing us to see moments from the past and present, as well as the vast and the small. Photography has also shown us images from all over the world, including distant parts of the solar system, and has given us a glimpse into the complexities and crises of modern life.

The use of visual images to record events has a long history, dating back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. While we may not know the exact purpose of these early images, they seem to be closely linked to human culture. Throughout history, there have been questions about the accuracy of visual images and their status in society. The idea that'seeing is believing' has always given special importance to visual images.

When photography was invented, it had a significant impact on society. The technology was seen as a way to provide a truthful visual record, and the camera was considered a machine that could capture what we see. The chemical fixing of the image allowed us to capture a natural phenomenon, and the photographic image was seen as an achievement of sophisticated culture.

However, the assumption that everyone would understand photographs because of their perceived realism led to questions about whether photography is a universal language. While it is true that photographs can be understood across cultures, it is also important to consider the cultural differences that may affect our understanding of them.

Photography has undergone significant changes since its invention in 1839. The technology and attitudes towards photography have evolved, and the medium has moved from being a record-keeper to becoming a means of communication that can promote social and political change.

For example, photography played a crucial role in the Italian Renaissance, and it has also contributed to the development of our media culture. At the same time, photography has brought the harsh realities of the world to our coffee tables, making us more aware of the world around us.

**Writing Poetry and Other Forms of Writing**

Writing poetry, short stories, or screenplays is a complex process that requires a combination of creativity, discipline, and practice. It's like navigating a minefield, where one wrong step can lead to chaos. To avoid this, it's essential to read widely, write frequently, and let your imagination run wild. Some people need stability in their lives before they can write, while others can write to escape their troubles. Everyone has their own unique approach, as long as it's not forced or prescriptive.

**Finding Your Voice**

The key to writing is finding your own unique voice and style. This means listening to your inner thoughts and ideas, and expressing them in a way that feels natural and authentic. It's like finding a tune that resonates with you, and letting it grow and develop over time.

**Short Stories**

Short stories require a different approach than longer forms of writing. You need to be concise and focused, with a clear structure and plot. Flashbacks should be brief and serve a purpose, rather than overwhelming the reader. Dialogue is a powerful tool for revealing character and advancing the plot.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. You need to think strategically, planning your moves in advance, but also be prepared to adapt and respond to changing circumstances. The more you write, the more you'll develop your skills and understanding of the craft.

**The Nature of Writing**

Writing is a unique and complex human activity that is distinct from spoken language. While language is an instinct, writing is a skill that must be learned and developed. Children are naturally inclined to speak and communicate orally, but writing is a more abstract and artificial process that requires effort and practice. Understanding how writing works and how children learn to read and write is essential for effective teaching and learning.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

I've never started a book with more doubts. I'm not even sure what to call it. The story is about a man I knew, but I only saw him occasionally, and I don't know what happened to him in between. I could make things up to fill in the gaps, but I don't want to. I just want to write what I know.

To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I've given the people in the story fake names, and I've taken other steps to keep them anonymous. The man I'm writing about is not famous, and it's possible he never will be. But it's also possible that his way of living and his special qualities will have a lasting impact on others, and people will realize what a remarkable person he was after he's gone.

If that happens, it will be clear who I'm writing about, and people who want to learn more about his early life will be able to find that information in this book. I think it will be a useful resource for his biographers.

I don't claim that the conversations I've recorded are word-for-word accurate. I don't have notes from our conversations, but I have a good memory for what's important to me. I've written the conversations in my own words, but I believe they accurately capture what was said.

I've taken some liberties with what people said, just like historians do. I've done it to make the story more engaging and believable. The intelligent reader will be able to tell when I've done this, and they can choose to ignore it if they want.

I'm also worried about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to truly understand someone from a different background. People are shaped by their upbringing, their family, their education, and their experiences. You can't really know someone unless you've lived their life. And because you can't know someone from a different culture just by reading about them, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've only written about people from my own culture before, and even in short stories, I've only given broad hints about my characters and left the details to the reader's imagination. In this book, I'm trying to be honest about how I see my characters, not how they see themselves.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the passage, targeted at a C1 learner:

At any given time, the literary scene can seem confusing to those living through it. It's only with hindsight that the pattern of great writers and their contributions becomes clear. Today, there is a lot of confusion about poetry, with many different styles, factions, and ways of presenting and teaching it. There's a debate between poets who write for publication and those who perform their work in public. Some poets focus on writing for the page, while others prefer to read their poems aloud. This division is not absolute, and many poets do both. Over the past twenty years, poetry readings have become more popular, with small literary societies, schools, and arts festivals hosting events. These events can be beneficial for poets, but they also have their drawbacks. Poets who write for performance may struggle to be appreciated by audiences who are unfamiliar with their work. On the other hand, poets who focus on writing for the page may be tempted to simplify their work to make it more accessible. Attending poetry readings can be enjoyable, but it's not a substitute for reading poetry on the page. Hearing a good poet read their work can be helpful, but it's best if the audience has prior knowledge of the poems or follows along with the text. The main reason for popular poetry readings is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to a wider audience.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Broke down long sentences into shorter ones
* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases
* Simplified sentence structures
* Changed some technical terms, such as ""reciprocal mistrust and disapproval"" to ""debate""
* Removed examples that were too specific or cultural (e.g. jazz and poetry performances)
* Emphasized the main points and ideas
* Used more straightforward language and avoided jargon<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Oral History

Historians often use oral evidence to learn about the past, but it's not without its problems. When someone tells their story, they're influenced by the person asking the questions and the context of the conversation. Even if the historian doesn't ask any questions, the fact that they're there can affect how the person remembers and tells their story. The historian's own biases and way of thinking can also influence the information they gather.

When historians are not present, the person telling the story may have already been influenced by other sources, such as the media, or their own feelings and emotions. This can make it difficult to know what is true and what is not.

Animal Science

There are two main ways to study animals: by looking at their physiology (how their bodies work) or by studying their behavior in their natural environment. Physiologists focus on how animals' bodies work, while those who study behavior look at how animals act in their natural habitats.

Psychologists and ethologists are two types of scientists who study animal behavior. Psychologists often work in labs with a limited number of species, such as rats and pigeons, to understand how they learn. Ethologists study animals in their natural habitats to understand their natural behavior.

While physiologists think their methods are more fundamental, it's important to study animal behavior as well. Behavior has its own patterns and units that need to be studied separately.

The Social Sciences

When students start studying social sciences, they need to learn two things at once: the subject matter and the methods used to study it. Social sciences are not just common sense; each discipline has its own methods, concepts, and focuses on a specific aspect of social life.

Classical Architecture

In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building structures, but also about creating art. The Roman architect Vitruvius defined architecture as including Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He emphasized the aesthetic aspect of architecture, which was important to the ancient Greeks and Romans.

The origins of classical architecture are complex, and there was a long history of basic construction before the sophisticated architectural concepts developed. The classical temple, which may seem grand and ornate, is actually a simple, single-roomed hut at its core.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Lily and her sisters kept her driving a secret from her brother-in-law, Chen, for a while. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line, and then return to the gasworks, where she would park near the sulphur and brimstone smell. Chen was actually amused by what Lily had been doing behind his back. He thought it was funny that she could drive and said, ""Well done, Lily!"" Men can be strange, Mui thought. Brother-in-law should have been upset, but instead, he was excited to go on a trip with Lily. They planned to go on a Monday at the beginning of the next month, early in the morning and back by midday. Lily would practice driving around the allotments before they left.

Mui was initially hesitant, but she eventually agreed to go along with the plan. She bought a road map and got a 10% discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt a bit insulted. On the day of the trip, they set off and Lily drove impeccably. Even Mui, who was sitting in the back, was impressed. They passed by the English Channel and drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street near the seafront, where she was unsure about the road markings and didn't want to risk getting fined.

After the trip, Chen joked that no one would want to steal their old van. The sisters felt offended, and Mui rebuked him for being proud and easily deceived. Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea, and in that moment, he decided to plan Man Kee's future. He wanted his son to have an education in figures and grow up to own many restaurants.

As they were looking at the sea, Chen spotted a ship on the horizon. He put a coin in the telescope and trained it on the ship. He was unable to find it at first, but eventually, he saw it clearly. He showed it to Man Kee and told him that it was a special ship that would take them back home when they were finished here. Chen kissed Man Kee's head and said, ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee was reluctant to let go of the telescope, and when he did, the mechanism stopped working, and all Lily could see was a blurry circle of white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was over the horizon, and all they could see was seagulls scavenging in the wake.<|eot_id|>"

I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down, but I didn't think about the extra weight of the bucket or your lack of strength. You held the handle, and I fell into the well. I hit my head, and everything went dark.

When I came to, I saw strange, swirling lights. Later, I realized that I must have hit my head and seen stars like those in cartoons. At first, I was disoriented, then scared, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what my parents would say.

You called out to me, and I tried to answer, but you called again, and I stopped. I lay there, looking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, and I heard raised voices coming from the castle door. I got out of the well, pulled myself up, and ran to the moat bridge. I hid in the shadows, watching my parents and Arthur come looking for me.

I was filled with a strange, exhilarating feeling. Then I saw the drops of water I had left behind on the cobblestones. I felt horror and panic. My parents were searching for me, and I had to come up with a plan. I thought about it quickly, and then I had an idea. I crept out of the shadows, stumbled a little, and collapsed on the ground. My mother found me and comforted me, and I told her that I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I claimed I had crawled and swum through it until I got out.

But my father didn't believe me. He asked me to repeat my story, and I hesitated. He looked at me with a cold, hard gaze, and I knew I was in trouble. I tried to cover up, saying that the tunnel had collapsed, but my father just looked at me with contempt. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me with pity and regret, shaking his head. His expression said that he knew I was lying and was worried about my future. His words cut deep, and I realized that I had gone too far.

Susan is leaving the family home after her children have grown up and moved away. The removal company, 'Removers of Distinction', is packing up every item in the house, including the Steinway piano. Susan is trying to come to terms with leaving the house where she has spent so many happy years with her family. She remembers the day they moved in, when the piano got stuck on the stairs and they had to find a way to get it inside. Her late husband, Peter, resolved the problem by having a builder remove a window and a crane lifted the piano into the house.

As Susan watches the removal men packing up the house, she feels a mix of emotions. She is trying not to cry, but it's hard to see everything being taken away. Her children, Robert and Francesca, are helping with the move, and Robert is making sure the piano is handled carefully. Susan remembers how much they struggled to get the piano inside the house, and how they finally managed to get it in by removing a window and using a crane.

As the removal men are about to leave, Susan feels a pang of sadness. She looks around the emptying house and remembers all the happy moments they had there. She is on the verge of tears, but then she starts laughing with her children as they see the humor in the situation. They are all laughing together, relieved that the move is over.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

The idea of online literary criticism has become more accessible with the rise of the internet. In the early days, it was thought that anyone could publish a book review or create a music channel online. However, it wasn't until Amazon, a popular online bookshop, allowed anyone to write reviews that the concept of online literary criticism became a reality. Amazon's approach was to let anyone submit a review, which would then appear on the book's page. This allowed readers to see what other readers thought of a book, rather than just relying on professional critics or the publisher's blurb.

However, this freedom to write reviews also led to some problems. With thousands of reviews being submitted every day, it was difficult for Amazon to check them all. As a result, some reviews were removed if they didn't follow the company's guidelines. These guidelines included not allowing single-word reviews, personal attacks on the author, or reviews that gave away the ending. Despite this, some authors took advantage of the system by writing fake reviews of their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, even wrote fake reviews to counteract negative reviews of his book.

Amazon also provided a way for authors to comment on their own books, but this feature wasn't foolproof. Some authors used this feature to post messages, but it wasn't checked to ensure they were really from the author. In one case, a fake review was submitted claiming to be from John Updike, but it was quickly removed.

The majority of reviews on Amazon were serious and provided an accurate indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books involved inventing reactions towards books about which one had no spontaneous feelings. The democratization of book reviews has made it possible for readers to share their opinions and help others make informed decisions about what to read.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Art has changed over the past two hundred years. We now expect artists to be unique, revolutionary, and shocking. We praise artists who were unknown a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to art from our own time, we often feel uncomfortable and say it's not art. The media often agrees with us. We expect artists to be special, talented, and driven, and we get upset if they don't fit this image.

In the past, people would commission artists to create specific pieces for specific purposes. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get annoyed if they don't produce what we expect.

Let me describe a situation and ask a question about it. An artist chooses a text from an art book that talks about the diversity of pictures. The text says there is no end to the different kinds of pictures. The artist then asks someone else to create a canvas with the text written on it in simple black letters. My question is: is the finished product a painting?

In the art world, it's common for artists to stick to what they're good at and what people like. But some artists break the mold and try something new. Eric Rimmington is one such artist who is now exploring the world of the London Underground. He's known for his still-life paintings, but this new show is a departure from his usual style.

Art can be a way to escape reality and heal. The writer of this passage believes that art can help us make sense of the world and find meaning in our lives. Artists can use their work to express their emotions and experiences, and this can be a way to fulfill their destiny.

My father and I were driving back to London after a school event. I had just received some prizes for my academic achievements, and my father was discussing my future plans. He was worried that I would not want to join the family business, which had been in our family for generations. I had always known that I would have to take over the business one day, but I had other ambitions. My father was a successful businessman and knew a lot about the law, so he was concerned that I would not be interested in the family business. He also thought that I had the skills and personality to be a good lawyer. I didn't want to upset him, so I agreed to help with the family business during my holidays and after I finished university. This way, I could gain some experience and still have time to pursue my own interests.

As I was about to finish my studies, my father asked me to do one last task for him. It was a very important project for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my while. I was worried about the timing, as I had my final exams coming up, but I knew that my father would be disappointed if I refused. I decided to do the task, even though it meant putting my own plans on hold.

My father was a driven person who always focused on his goals. He was a genius in his own way, and I admired his determination. However, this made me realize that my own plans and aspirations were not as important to him as his own goals. I felt a sense of responsibility to help him, even if it meant putting my own dreams on hold.

Simon Costello knew he had made a mistake buying a house in Pembroke Square within a year of moving in with his wife Lois. They had thought it was a good idea at the time, but it turned out to be a financial strain. Simon had been having a streak of successful cases, and Lois had just gone back to her job at an advertising agency after taking time off to have twins. She had even received a promotion, which increased her salary to £35,000. Lois had been the one pushing for a move, citing the need for more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for their au pair. Simon had agreed, but they could have achieved the same things in a suburb or a less expensive part of London.

Lois believed that one of them should take public transport to work to save money. Since her office was on the other side of London, Simon was the one who had to make the sacrifice. The daily commute had become a source of frustration and resentment for him.

Simon's thoughts turned to his childhood, when he would visit his grandparents in Hampstead. His grandmother would make sure his grandfather, a lawyer, was relaxed and happy after a long day in court. Simon's grandfather's wife, a lawyer's wife, was known for her dedication to her husband's career and her own social circle. Simon and Lois had a modern marriage, where both partners valued their careers equally.

Their lifestyle depended on the two of them having two salaries. But now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, a lawyer who had confronted Simon about a past mistake. Simon had defended a client, Brian Cartwright, who had bribed some jurors. Venetia accused Simon of knowing about it beforehand but doing nothing. Simon denied it, but his denial seemed unconvincing even to himself. He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering the accusations and the look of contempt in Venetia's eyes.

Simon wondered why Venetia was so angry and what she planned to do. He knew that if this got out, his career would be ruined. He wasn't sure what she could do, but he was worried about the consequences.<|eot_id|>"

I chose to live in this place, hoping to find anonymity among people who didn't care about the state of their homes. But, as it often does, hope proved to be wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you're trying to keep a low profile. Next door's overgrown roses remind me that the gardens were once loved. I usually stay indoors, trying to forget about the summer, but tonight I'm sitting in my small London garden, surrounded by plants that have grown tall or sprawling to survive. 

My neighbor, Jaz, is an unpublished writer and sometimes asks me to pretend to like her work. I've recently received a copy of her latest manuscript. When she comes out to chat, I try to avoid her, but she notices my garden is a mess. ""I've been doing some clearing,"" she says, leaning out of her window. I'm not keen on having her in my garden, and I realize it looks worse than I thought. 

Jaz is a bit of a talker and starts asking me about my plans for the summer. I'm not looking forward to the empty days ahead, but I tell her I'm going to visit my friend Ruby at a pub called the Rising Sun. Jaz offers to ask Ruby if I can stay with her, and I appreciate it. When she asks about her latest manuscript, I try to be kind and say I like the title. But then I make a mistake and offer her some unsolicited advice. I suggest she write about nicer people and less about herself. Jaz is offended and accuses me of being prissy and out of touch. I try to defend myself, but it's clear we have different views on writing.

In the end, we go inside, and I'm grateful to be back in my calm kitchen. But then I start thinking about my school days and my geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to wink at us and say, ""I've had my moments.""<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

Heritage is important because it helps us connect with our past and understand who we are today. We often learn about our personal heritage from our families and grandparents, but there is also a wider need to learn about our national heritage to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity and helps us feel part of something bigger than ourselves.

Our national heritage is like a culture that has been passed down through generations, and it includes both things we like and things we don't like. It's important to learn about our heritage because it can teach us a lot and help us feel more connected to our community.

In the past, people learned about their heritage through stories and legends passed down from their ancestors. However, with the rise of industrial society, many of these stories were lost. Today, we can learn about our heritage by visiting places and seeing the physical remains of the past.

I wrote a novel called Waterland, which is set in a part of England called the Fens. The Fens are a unique and fascinating place that is often overlooked. They are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, and seem both open and mysterious.

Museums are important because they help us learn about our heritage by providing access to real objects and artifacts from the past. They should make their collections accessible to everyone, not just experts. This can be done by using creative displays and outreach programs.

The desire to preserve our heritage is natural, especially in times of change. As we face rapid change in our towns and cities, it's important to think about what we want to preserve and how we can do it in a way that works for everyone.

Einstein is a well-known scientist, and his face is often used to promote products that are associated with intelligence. Many people know that he developed some important theories, but few understand what they are about. Einstein's theories are famous for being complex and making predictions that are hard to understand. He was a key figure in a major scientific revolution in the 20th century. Scientists and mathematicians were trying to create a new way to describe the universe by studying the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein's contributions were significant because he looked at the basics of time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Previous theories were based on the idea of an absolute universe, where stars and planets moved in a fixed framework of space and time. Einstein disagreed, saying that time and space are not absolute, but relative.

As children, Lydia and I were skeptical of prize-winning books because we thought they would be boring. Our mother would sometimes scold us for not wanting to read, while our father would give us small rewards to encourage us to read certain books. He would sometimes include a book in our Christmas or birthday presents, labeling it ""Not Literature"". Although we didn't like most of his suggestions, he did introduce us to some short stories and poetry.

[Insert a paragraph break]

The origin of human language is still a mystery, and many people have tried to explain it. Some people think that our ancestors made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared or in danger. These sounds may have developed into languages, and some words may have originated from these early sounds. For example, the word ""malaria"" comes from the idea of a ""bad air"" that causes fever. Recently, scientists have been studying the origin and evolution of language, and they think that it probably developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. Language was likely used for social interaction and power struggles, and it was not primarily used for sharing information.<|eot_id|>"

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from a practical perspective. Most reviews are written under conditions that make them short-lived. They have deadlines, are limited in length, and are usually only published for a day or a week. The fleeting nature of reviews often leads people to believe that reviewing is only done for financial reasons or because it's a way to occupy one's time. However, reviewing is a skilled and multifaceted job that requires a great deal of expertise.

A reviewer needs to consider several factors, including the length of the review, the intended audience, and the complexity of the subject matter. They must also be able to write in a way that is clear and engaging for readers. It's no surprise that many reviewers also write other types of content, as reviewing is a secondary occupation that requires a primary occupation to be done well.

Some people, like the American novelist John Updike, enjoy reviewing in their spare time. Despite his criticism of reviewing, he collects his reviews in books. Others may not be as fortunate, but it's understandable that they would want to preserve their work, even if it's not widely read.

As an academic, I've written reviews and academic books. In the English-speaking world, it's common for academics to also review books, as it helps to keep them informed and engaged with the broader literary world. In fact, reviewing can be beneficial for both readers and academics, as it ensures that reviews are written by someone with expertise in the subject matter.<|eot_id|>"

Ralph opened the door to his flat and felt a moment of hesitation, a feeling he still experienced occasionally after three years of living alone. When he first bought the flat, he would come home early, eager to see what had happened while he was away. He had seen it as a welcome place, a space where he could be himself. He didn't worry about intruders or broken pipes; instead, he noticed how the flat looked, whether it was tidy or not. Over time, he started to think of it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings could spill out.

The flat was not perfect, though. Sometimes, there were letters and messages on the floor, and the answering machine would be blinking. Ralph was grateful that nothing was broken or damaged. He looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the office. On his bus ride home, he would feel his identity slowly coming back. But when he sat at his desk, he would crave solitude and time to himself. However, this relief was short-lived, and he would feel empty and unsure of himself.

Goat Racing

I was excited to watch goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. The atmosphere was lively, with ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. People were moving towards the racecourse, but I managed to push my way through the crowds to get a good spot. The area had been set up with a course for the goats to run along, with spectators lining the sides. The goats were being kept in order, which was no easy task, as they are known to eat almost anything they can find.

Canoe Trip

As the day came to an end, I started thinking about the night ahead. I was worried because our canoe was wet and we didn't have a place to sleep. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we could see the cliffs in the distance. We replaced our torch batteries, but they didn't work, so we couldn't find a place to camp. After a few more miles, Lesley spotted a light in the distance, and we were hopeful. However, it turned out to be just moonlight on the waves. We could hear the sound of rushing water, but we couldn't see what was happening. We continued on our way.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a C1 learner:

There are some things that cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry, they may not turn out well. For example, if you add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you're trying to untangle a fishing line, you'll only make it worse if you pull on it too hard.

The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks require quick thinking, while others need more time. We can improve our speed at solving problems, like crosswords or mental math, but some tasks are better done slowly. If we rush, we may make mistakes or get stuck.

The mind has three main ways of processing information: fast, slow, and very slow. The first is instinctive and helps us react quickly in emergency situations. The second is deliberate and involves thinking carefully about a problem. The third is more relaxed and helps us come up with creative solutions.

This slower way of thinking is often associated with creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long recognized the importance of slowing down and reflecting. Recently, scientists have also discovered the value of this slower thinking. They have found that our unconscious mind can learn patterns and solve complex problems more effectively than our conscious mind.

In conclusion, it's essential to recognize the different speeds at which our mind works and use each one appropriately. We need to be able to think quickly in some situations and slowly in others. By acknowledging the value of slow thinking, we can improve our problem-solving skills and make better decisions.

I used to be confident in social situations because of my ability to talk easily. But here, I'm not used to being in a foreign environment and don't have the same level of social status. I've started to feel a bit down, which I think is because I've lost that sense of confidence.

A lot has changed in astronomy over the past 50 years. Until recently, there were limited resources for amateur astronomers. Now, there are many telescopes and equipment available, and computers have made it easier to analyze data and share results. However, this has also led to some drawbacks. Light pollution from cities and air traffic has made it harder to observe the stars. In the past, it was possible to find dark skies in urban areas, but now it's harder to find a spot with minimal light pollution.

In today's society, we have too many choices and options, which can be overwhelming. We're constantly bombarded with new products and services, making it hard to keep up. This has led to a trend towards seeking simplicity and authenticity. People are looking for meaningful experiences and connections, rather than just more choices.

'Othello: A Second Chance to Review

I'm glad to have the opportunity to review the production of Othello again. My previous review was unfair, and I was wrong about the actor playing the title role. I still think it's a mistake to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but the rest of the performance was excellent. The whole cast did a great job, especially in the scenes where Cassio's competitive games get out of hand and Iago struggles to control himself. The scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed is also very moving. The pace and tension throughout the play are terrific. Don't miss this production.

Lake Vostok

In Antarctica, there is a vast lake hidden beneath 4 kilometers of ice. The water has been isolated for up to 25 million years and is home to unknown organisms. Scientists are eager to explore the lake and discover its secrets. For two years, researchers have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and we can expect to see some exciting discoveries in the next few years.

Scientists and Their Motivations

Recently, I heard an interesting discussion on the radio about what drives scientists to do their work. Some scientists are asking why they want to know everything, from the smallest particles to the universe. They want to know why we want to know these things and why science can't explain why we want to know. I think it's more important to focus on whether what we're doing is right rather than debating the point of it all. The key issue is that science is a tool, and we should decide how, when, and why we use it.'

Food is an essential part of our lives. We often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. However, making a simple soup with a few vegetables and herbs can be incredibly satisfying and delicious. Instead of buying processed food, we can create something special in just a few minutes. Cooking is also a way to show love and care for others. Sharing meals with family and friends is a way to connect and celebrate important moments in our lives.

In the office, Alistair was struggling to keep up with his paperwork. He was expecting a meeting with Mallory, who was known for being punctual and organized. He was worried about how she would react to the mess in his office. Meanwhile, Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had a different perspective on his apartment. She saw it as her territory and was not happy about the state of his office.

Karen's desire to create her own identity and story led her to develop a mythology of strength and difference. She had a significant moment in her life when she was hit in the eye with a golf club by her brother. Although it was a painful experience, she was grateful that she was not blinded. When she saw her mother, she knew that she was meant for something special.

Miss Fogerty was both excited and saddened by the news of Dr. Bailey's condition. She was grateful for his care and attention over the years and remembered his kind and understanding nature.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

Joanna MacGregor is a famous pianist with a busy schedule. You might wonder why she decided to write books for children learning piano. Even people who don't have a good ear for music can be moved by her performances. She is known for her incredible skills, playing complex pieces with ease. However, even she was surprised when a young boy at a recent concert asked her to play the theme song from a popular TV show, ""Match of the Day"". She was happy to oblige and found that this was a way to connect with the child.

Joanna is unusual among top pianists because she cares about how children learn piano. She has just published her own book, ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"", which is designed to make learning fun. Despite her busy schedule, she has managed to write the book, which is part of a series. She believes that the first lessons are crucial and that many people's interest in music is not about being a virtuoso, but about enjoying music in everyday life.

Joanna has a lot of experience teaching piano to children. She taught piano to many students between the ages of 18 and 25, and also grew up surrounded by music in her childhood home. She believes that everyone should be able to learn to play the piano, regardless of their ability. Some children may have a natural talent, while others may need more time and practice.

Joanna is concerned that some parents put too much pressure on their children to be like famous pianists, which can lead to them giving up. She thinks that music should be enjoyable, not a way to achieve something. Her book includes stories and accompaniments to make learning fun. She also emphasizes the importance of practice and finding a balance between easy and challenging pieces.

Writing by hand and on a computer can have different effects on the quality of writing. Dr. Johnson believed that what is written easily is often read without pleasure. This means that good writing requires effort. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I'm surprised to see how few corrections I made. Today, I would probably rewrite them several times. I think this is because writing by hand slows down the brain and makes you think more carefully about what you're writing.

In contrast, writing on a computer can be too easy and fast. This can lead to sloppy writing. Many writers find that correcting their early drafts takes just as long as writing the first draft by hand. Emails can also be less thoughtful and emotional than handwritten letters.

However, technology has brought some benefits. It's now possible to write and share love letters easily, which is a nice change. But the words on a screen can lack the care and character of handwritten writing.

I was at a friend's house and he showed me his CD player. He said it was amazing that they could fit 70 minutes of music on one disc. I agreed and asked if you had to flip the disc like you do with records. He said no, you only play one side. I asked why, and he thought for a moment before saying that it's not clear why it's not possible to make both sides playable. He smiled and said it was a good point.

When comparing books and electronic text, some people think that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing. However, this is not necessarily true. It takes time for people's attitudes to change, and some people are still fond of traditional books.

A book from 1979 predicted that the 1980s would see the end of traditional books. However, this hasn't happened. Reading long texts on a screen can be difficult, and people tend to dip in and out of text rather than reading it from start to finish. Some people think this is a new and innovative way of reading, but it's not necessarily better.

In the office, I saw a perfectly organized room, just as I remembered it from a few weeks ago. The carpet was clear, and the desk was tidy. My colleague, Kathleen, was putting away files and said I needed to get a computer. I admired the room and didn't mention computers, as we'd had this conversation before. She was surprised, as I had written a paper about computer skills and was good with computers. She thought I should be more open to new technology.<|eot_id|>"

Lancelot's secretary, who had been making him cups of coffee for months, didn't ask him if he took sugar, she just assumed he didn't. This was because he usually wasn't supposed to be there, but he had recently started coming to work more often. The secretary handed him a folder with a typed label that said 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert'. Lancelot didn't want to see the synopsis again, as he had already read it and wasn't impressed. Ian Cuthbert was an old friend who had been given a large advance for this book, but Lancelot was starting to doubt that the book would ever be finished. The synopsis seemed unoriginal and lacked the brilliance that Ian was supposed to be known for. Lancelot remembered how Ian had been a promising young writer, but had never managed to deliver on his potential.

""Breakfast is very important for our health, as experts say. However, in England, breakfast is a relatively recent tradition. In medieval times, there were hardly any mentions of breakfast in literature. People usually didn't eat breakfast unless they were rich or royal. But in the 16th century, breakfast became the norm. Some people think this was because food was more widely available. Others believe that changes in the way people worked also played a role. As people started working set hours, they needed to eat a meal in the morning to give them energy. This was no longer just a luxury for the wealthy, but a necessity for everyone.""

Photography When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show and how to show it based on their skills, personal views, and experience. They also consider social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photo, as well as how people respond to it.

For example, when we look at a photo in a newspaper, we might question whether it accurately shows what happened or if it's just the photographer's perspective. Is the photo meant to show a specific moment in time or represent a bigger issue?

More than a game For me, sport has always been more than just a competition. The most successful athletes have complete confidence in themselves. To succeed, you need to focus solely on your goal and ignore everything else. Sport is tough and you have to do it yourself. It's sink or swim. Through sport, I've learned discipline and determination, but it can also teach you the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to excel individually, but it's also a team effort, and you need to balance these two aspects. Just like in life, you can succeed as an individual, but you can't forget about others around you.

Sport has given me a lot - not just financially. It has opened doors and opened my eyes to new experiences and things I wouldn't have seen otherwise. However, you also have to make sacrifices for those benefits.

Memories Some experiences are so vivid that they become clear and distinct in our memories. For me, one such moment occurred many years ago in California, when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing in a nearby tree. The bird's beautiful singing kept me awake, and I found myself drawn into its musical world. I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music to follow the patterns of the bird's song, and I felt like I was witnessing an incredible improvisational performance. I was so captivated that I cheered and groaned as the bird sang, and eventually, I fell asleep.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

Birds have always played a significant role in human culture. We love them, fear them, and sometimes worship them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this question by looking at our relationships with different bird species.

Take the wren, for example. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, the image of the wren is still found in many British homes. This shows that, despite changes in our beliefs, the wren remains an important part of our culture.

Our connections with birds go back to a time when people relied more heavily on nature for survival. This led to the development of a special language and way of thinking about the natural world. This language is still with us today, and it's what gives birds their symbolic meaning.

The red kite is a good example of how our attitudes towards birds can change over time. Once seen as a valuable urban scavenger, it was later seen as a pest and almost became extinct. Now, it's a protected species and is being reintroduced to the wild.

Our fascination with birds is not just about their physical characteristics, but also about what they represent. Flight, song, and freedom are all qualities that we admire and aspire to. This is why birds have become a symbol of environmental change and a warning of ecological decline.

The loss of certain bird species is not just a loss of biodiversity, but also a loss of cultural heritage. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are all symbols of love, romance, and magic in literature and folklore. Their decline is a cultural loss that affects us deeply.

Folklore and storytelling have a special power to connect us with the natural world and evoke strong emotions. This is why stories about birds are so important. They help us understand our place in the world and our relationship with nature.

The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of this connection. It's a symbol of the complex and mysterious bond between humans and birds.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in terms of time, such as 'a day's journey' or 'a few hours' walk'. However, this method did not provide accurate information about actual distance. Direction was also important, but for ordinary travelers, it was not crucial to know the exact direction. Written itineraries were often used instead of maps.

Early maps varied in their conventions, depending on their purpose and the place they were created. For example, maps of railway systems might not show accurate directions. Landmarks along a route were often indicated by signs, which varied in size to show their importance.

The history of cartography is the story of how cartographers have improved their ability to measure distance and direction, and how they have included more information on their maps. Cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences, such as astronomy and geology, to create more accurate maps.

Over time, the demands on mapmakers have changed. Travelers, merchants, soldiers, and scientists have all needed maps for different purposes. The invention of the contour line, for example, allowed mapmakers to show the shape of the land more accurately.

Today, cartographers create maps for a wide range of purposes, from showing the distribution of geological strata to land use. The value of maps in many sciences has led to a modern renaissance in cartography.

It's important to note that the development of cartography has not been continuous or linear. There have been periods of stagnation and retrogression, and mapmakers have often had to wait for technical improvements before they could apply new ideas. Maps should not be accepted uncritically, but rather studied as a record of human knowledge and thought.

The study of historical cartography is fascinating because it allows us to understand how maps have been used and created over time, and how they reflect the knowledge and values of different cultures.<|eot_id|>"

I visited Andrew Lloyd Webber's home, a cozy and cultured space surrounded by a cluttered area where his family members lived. His room was like an upgrade from a small kitchen to a luxurious hotel. I was amazed by his extensive record collection, his first stereo player, and his taste in Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. Andrew was a teenager who had won a scholarship to Oxford University to study history and was looking forward to becoming a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I, on the other hand, wanted to become a pop star for fame, money, and women. The difference was that my dreams were not as intense as his, but I was willing to give it a try.

Andrew introduced himself as a talented composer and pianist, and I was impressed by his skills. He played me some of his compositions, which reminded me of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a lyricist for his musicals, and I had a chance to show off my skills. I had written a song with an unknown group, and Andrew was impressed. We decided to work together, and I was excited to be part of his project.

I was more interested in pop music than musical theater, but I saw the potential in Andrew's talent and determination. I told myself that I wouldn't miss the opportunity to work with someone who was going to make a name for himself in the industry. Even if we didn't succeed, we could try to create something new and innovative.

The next day, my enthusiasm had faded a bit, and I went back to my office job at the solicitors. I decided to keep an eye on the job ads and write more songs, but I was still considering the possibility of a career in show business. Andrew had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a 19th-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. I wasn't convinced by the idea, but Andrew's talent and confidence were infectious. I decided to give it a try, and we started working on the project.<|eot_id|>"

Language is a remarkable ability that allows us to shape each other's thoughts with precision. It's hard to imagine life without it. People often talk to each other, and even to themselves, animals, or plants when they're alone. I think of language as an instinct, like a spider spinning a web. It's not something you learn in school or because you're good at building things. Climate and weather greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. For example, warm and wet conditions create lush tropical forests, while cold and windy areas support fewer species. Weather patterns shape the climate, which is influenced by the movement of air in the atmosphere. The sun also plays a significant role in air movement. Coffee is a crucial part of many restaurants, and I learned about making it during my training. I discovered that making a good cup of coffee requires attention to detail and practice.

Why is it that television shows about art often fail to impress? Painting and sculpture are natural subjects for TV, as the camera can show the entire work of art and then zoom in on the details. However, I can think of few TV shows that successfully convey the pleasure and complexity of looking at art. A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, American Visions. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a commanding personality, and he was given nearly eight hours to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have ignored. I expected the series to focus on great works of art. Instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

In my previous career, I worked as an international metals dealer for 20 years. I gained a reputation as a speculator and learned that metals are regulated less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it's possible to make a lot of money. However, the free-trade economists who claimed that the market would maintain the price of scarce metals have been proven wrong. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago.

I recently investigated allegations made against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas that stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own personality, and each has something to offer.

The self-help industry is huge and growing, and it's not just about helping people, but also making money.

Air-conditioning at Cannons Gym

Cannons Gym, a popular spot for lunch in the City of London, has turned up the air-conditioning to combat the hot summer temperatures. It's so cool that it feels like being in the Arctic at times. This is just one example of how air-conditioning is often overused. Many buildings could use alternative methods to stay cool, such as using natural light and ventilation, or building walls that absorb and release heat. These methods might seem obvious, but they can make a big difference and reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It's interesting that sundials, which measure time by the sun's position, are gaining popularity again. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping accurate time.

American business leaders are looking up to the famous polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Many people in Britain know who Shackleton was and what he did, but in the United States, he was relatively unknown until recently. However, American companies are now discovering him and his remarkable leadership skills.

Shackleton's story is being told through books, films, and exhibitions. Some American managers are using his experiences as a guide for their own leadership styles. For example, Jim MacGregor, a management consultant, has been inspired by Shackleton's approach. MacGregor's company specializes in helping companies deal with crises, such as mergers and acquisitions, and he believes that Shackleton's leadership skills are relevant to these situations.

Shackleton's qualities as a leader and communicator are what make him a model for modern management. He was a natural leader who always put the needs of his team first. He was also able to adapt to difficult situations and make tough decisions, such as turning back from the South Pole when it became clear that it was not possible to reach it.

Shackleton's leadership skills are still relevant today. In times of crisis, people want to know that someone is in charge and willing to take responsibility. Shackleton was not afraid to do this, and his team respected him for it. He was also able to keep his team motivated and focused, even in the most challenging situations.

Shackleton's story is a reminder that leadership is not just about making decisions, but also about being a role model and setting an example. He believed that a good leader should be optimistic, physically fit, and patient. He also believed that it is important to be willing to change plans if they are not working and to take calculated risks.

Shackleton's legacy is a reminder that leadership is not just about achieving a goal, but also about how you treat others along the way. His story is an inspiration to anyone who wants to be a good leader and make a positive impact on those around them.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a unique primate called the aye-aye. Like woodpeckers, it searches for insect larvae by drilling into wood. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to find and scoop up its prey. Scientists have studied the aye-aye's hunting skills to understand how it finds its food. Dr. Carl Erickson, from Duke University's Primate Center, observed two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her infant daughter, Annabelle. He wanted to know if they could find insects just by looking for signs on the surface of the wood. He presented them with logs with holes, some with mealworms and some empty. The aye-ayes went straight for the holes with food, without needing to see any signs on the surface. This led Dr. Erickson to wonder if they used their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects. However, further tests showed that they didn't rely on these senses either. The aye-ayes could find the mealworms even when the smell was blocked and the insects were silent. So, how did they find them? Dr. Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those with mealworms. They seem to sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and brings its large ears forward, focusing them at the point in front of its nose. Dr. Erickson believes that the aye-aye is using echolocation, listening for the reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It can also hear the rustling of insects that move when disturbed by the tapping. The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an interesting one. However, there are birds that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker, but also an echo-locating bat and a squirrel, as it has similar habits and physical characteristics.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Many people have photographs of their grandparents, but few know what their lives were like when they were young. We often intend to write down our stories, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has come up with a solution: she writes the autobiographies of ordinary people, producing a book of at least 20,000 words with illustrations. The idea came to her when she realized how much of her own family's past was disappearing. She now writes the stories of people she meets, who share their lives with her. They enjoy doing it, and it helps them overcome any worries about sharing their stories. 

The people she writes about are honest and open, sharing both happy and difficult moments from their lives. They recognize patterns from their childhood that still affect them today. Renier has found that many people are still influenced by their parents' words and actions from when they were young. This can lead to repeating patterns of behavior and even regret or resentment towards their parents. 

Renier keeps a distance while recording the stories, acting as a recorder rather than an inquisitor. She uses the recordings to write the life story, rearranging the events in a logical order. The finished book is well-written and interesting, but not sensational or sensationalized. The cost of the book is around £3,000, which may deter some people. However, those who have had their stories written by Renier are happy with the result and feel it's a valuable way to leave a lasting legacy for their families.

A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has an impressive collection of over 600 plaster casts of Greek and Roman sculptures. What's important to know is that none of these sculptures are originals. They were created as accurate replicas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The museum is located in a specially designed gallery with plenty of natural light. One of the advantages of plaster casts is that they allow us to see groups of sculptures together, even if they are now split between different museums across Europe. You can see many of the most famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in one afternoon.

B. Cambridge Darkroom

Cambridge Darkroom is a photography centre with community darkrooms and a gallery showing a variety of photography and related media. We offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a beginner's course and masterclasses with experienced photographers. Our members can use our darkrooms, and we also have a scheme for young photographers (ages 12-16) to develop their skills. We sell photography books and magazines, as well as photographic materials.

C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology

The Sedgwick Museum has an impressive collection of fossils, rocks, and minerals from around the world, including Britain's oldest intact geological collection. The museum is arranged by geological age, allowing you to see how life on Earth has changed over time. The collection includes over 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original 18th-century cabinets. The museum also has a new gallery featuring beautiful minerals and gems.

D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs

The university has a collection of over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The photographs show the changing landscape of Britain from prehistoric times to the present day.

While you can't borrow the photographs, you can buy copies, which are made to order and usually take about a month.

E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is one of the world's oldest and most unusual tourist attractions. You can create your own wall hangings by rubbing brass plates off medieval tombs. The centre has made it possible to preserve the originals and still make brass rubbing accessible to everyone. The brass plates were used as an alternative to tomb statues in medieval Europe, and most of the remaining ones are found in Britain. You can see a wide range of examples at the Cambridge Centre.<|eot_id|>"

A. The theatre director

I've been blessed with three children, and I can honestly say I've loved every moment of being a father. I've been lucky to have such a close bond with them. We share similar interests, like opera, theatre, and music, which has brought us closer together. As they've grown up, we've become more like friends than parent and child. I've never believed in physical punishment, and I've tried to be available for them whenever they need me.

B. The advertising executive

I became a father at a young age, and it was a big responsibility. It aged me quickly, but it also kept me young. As my children grew older, they introduced me to new things, like music and fashion, which has helped me stay connected with the younger generation. I've been fortunate to have been able to take them on holidays and attend important events with them.

C. The politician

As a politician, I've had to balance my work and family life. My children have been very understanding, and I make sure they can join me for weekend meetings and events. I believe it's essential to involve them in my work and make them feel included.

D. The writer

I became a single father after my first marriage ended, and it forced me to re-evaluate my role as a parent. I made a conscious effort to stay involved in my children's lives, even if it meant experimenting with unconventional living arrangements. My daughter has said that I was always there for her, but I regret not being a more structured parent. I've learned that being a good parent is not just about being present but also about setting boundaries and being a role model.

E. The TV presenter

I never thought I'd become a father, but when I did, it changed my life. Having a child has made me realize who I am and what I'm capable of. It's a humbling experience, but it's also incredibly rewarding. Seeing my daughter smile is the best way to forget any worries or stress I may have.

**Science in Zero Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joined a group of students on a unique flight to test their scientific theories. The plane, a Boeing KC-135, looked like a normal aircraft from the outside, but inside, it was transformed into a long, white tunnel with padded walls and a few remaining seats. The 13 students from Europe and America had won a competition to participate in the flight, which was a chance to conduct experiments in weightless conditions.

The plane took off smoothly, but soon the students were in for a wild ride. The pilot climbed to 3,000 meters and then cut the engines, allowing the plane to continue rising due to its own momentum. As it reached the top of the curve, the plane became weightless for a few seconds, giving the students a taste of what it's like to be in space.

The students conducted a series of experiments during the two-hour flight. One group tested how cats always land on their feet, while another team investigated how metal joints behave in zero gravity. Another group tried to create solar sails using thin liquid films hardened in sunlight.

The experience was exhilarating, and the students felt a sense of excitement and wonder. As one student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more.""

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I had an unusual period in my life where I didn't have any summers. Every year, I would go to New Zealand, which is winter there, and I would have nine winters in a row. I liked winter, so it was great. My parents suggested that we buy a small plot of land in New Zealand, which my father grew up in. They wanted us to take care of it and plant trees. If we did, we could have the land. We found a plot near Auckland and started planting trees in 1968. The land was not very good, but it was perfect for planting trees.

I was always interested in land and had worked on sheep farms in Australia. Planting trees seemed like a great idea, and I was excited to start. My family got more enthusiastic as we worked together. It took us three years to plant the 70 acres of land. The weather was very wet and cold, but we enjoyed it. We would get ready for each day's planting by putting on our wet and cold clothes and boots. It was a great feeling to be outside in nature.

I had a friend who was experienced in planting trees, which helped me a lot. We used a bag to carry the trees and planted them along a straight line. It was hard to get the lines straight, but once we did, it was easy to plant the trees. I enjoyed the physical work and got very fit. After a while, I could plant trees automatically, just like a rhythm.

As I worked, I started to think about the natural world and our place in it. This was the beginning of my interest in the environment, which has been a big part of my life since then. I have been back to New Zealand four times and seen the trees grow, which has been very satisfying. I still worry about the weather in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.

I took a break from teaching and went back to the tree farm in 1984. I stayed for three months and wrote my first book, Seeing Green. I would write in the mornings, prune the trees in the afternoons, and do research in the evenings. The connection between me and that place is still very strong. It's a special bond between people and the earth.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

We've had a lot of experience caring for orphaned animals on our dairy farm in Somerset. Recently, we took in three badger cubs. They were only eight inches long and had never been outside their underground sett before. The mother badger had been killed, and the cubs were cold and hungry. We took them in and kept them warm, feeding them every four hours. After a few days, they started drinking from a bottle and moving around. We named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow.

As they grew, we noticed that Willow was getting weaker. Unfortunately, he died from a lung infection. We were very sad, but we continued to care for the other two cubs. A few days later, we got a call from a local farmer who had found a single male badger cub. We named him Willow II and took him in. He was a bit more challenging to feed, but we managed to get him to eat.

As the cubs grew, we started to wean them off the bottle and introduced them to solid food. They loved eating cereals, meat, and vegetables. We also gave them fruits, nuts, and cheese. In the wild, badgers typically eat earthworms, beetles, and other insects.

As the summer went on, the cubs started to become more nocturnal, going for walks at dusk and night. They loved playing in the long grass and chasing each other's tails. We would join them on their walks, but sometimes they would nip us playfully. We were careful not to disturb their natural behavior.

As the cubs grew older, we noticed that they were venturing out of their enclosure more often. We were worried that they might encounter other badgers from neighboring sets, so we built a new home for them - a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. The local community was very supportive, and we were able to raise funds to build the sett.

Finally, the day came when we could let the badgers move into their new home. We watched them explore the sett and settle in. Now, we only see them occasionally, but they still come to say hello before going off into the night.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to recreate Sir Edmund Halley's journey to chart the variations of the compass. Halley, an astronomer, is best known for his comet, but his work on charting compass variations was crucial for navigation. Without it, sailors couldn't correct their compasses, making it impossible to determine their longitude accurately.

Halley's journey was a groundbreaking scientific expedition, and he became the first civilian to be appointed naval captain to pursue this research. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland before returning to England. He published his findings in 1701, which proved to be a valuable resource for sailors for over a century.

To commemorate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey, Dr. Clark plans to retrace the route of the Paramore, the ship Halley sailed on. He needs to raise £70,000 to fund the expedition, which will involve making precise measurements of the magnetic field using modern instruments. The data collected will help refine the existing model of the Earth's magnetic field.

Dr. Clark is a keen sailor and has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to divide the expedition into four stages, with four different crews. He believes that this journey will not only honor Halley's legacy but also provide valuable scientific data.

Dr. Clark became fascinated with Halley's life after reading biographies about him during his two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica. He thinks Halley led a remarkable life, with many achievements beyond his work on astronomy and geophysics. Dr. Clark hopes that his expedition will give Halley the recognition he deserves and provide a new perspective on his life and work.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent tails to the hens. This raises the question of how these birds evolved such an extravagant feature in a competitive world where nature is often harsh. Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find the answer. 

Charles Darwin believed that living creatures evolved through a process called natural selection, where individuals best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and have offspring. However, he struggled to explain why peacocks have such elaborate tails, as they seem to be a disadvantage. Darwin proposed that females choose males with beautiful tails simply because they find them attractive, without considering any practical benefits. 

Alfred Russel Wallace, a friend of Darwin's, disagreed. He thought that peahens choose males with showy tails because they possess some other quality that is not immediately apparent to humans, but is important for survival. 

Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to resolve the issue. Petrie and her team are observing the peafowl at Whipsnade, where they live in a semi-wild environment and are used to human presence. They are asking two main questions: do peahens really choose males with the most impressive tails, and do these males have any advantages that are not immediately apparent? 

The researchers have found that hens do prefer males with longer tails, and the number of eye-spots on the tail seems to be an important factor. However, they are still unsure whether these males have any other advantages. One hypothesis is that showy males are less likely to carry parasites, and their plumage advertises their health. 

Petrie and her team are currently comparing the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the attractive males have a survival advantage. If they do, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose males with showy tails because they have some practical benefit. 

There is also a mathematical theory, known as Fisher's Runaway, which suggests that a small advantage in tail length could lead to a rapid increase in tail length over generations. This theory would support Darwin's idea that females choose males with beautiful tails simply because they find them attractive.<|eot_id|>"

**My Dream Boat**

Tom Cunliffe, a sailor, believes that the best boat combines old and new ideas. He designed his own boat, the Westerman, with this in mind. This boat is different from most modern yachts, which are equipped with the latest technology. My boat, on the other hand, is designed to be simple and traditional, but still uses modern materials and techniques.

Some people might think that my boat looks old-fashioned, but it's actually a combination of old and new ideas. The designer, Nigel Irens, used computer software to help design the boat, but he also drew the initial design on a napkin and carved a model by hand. This way, he could ensure that the boat would be both functional and beautiful.

My boat has a coal stove for warmth and a cozy cabin for sleeping. It's designed for sailing, not for luxury. I believe that sailing should be a challenge, not just a comfortable experience. The Westerman has sailed across the North Atlantic and has won several racing competitions.

I built my boat to be timeless, not just a fashion statement. It's made of wood treated with a special glue, so it's waterproof and durable. I wanted a boat that would last for years, not just a few seasons. The Westerman is a living example of the importance of combining tradition and innovation in boat design.

**Retreat, Relax, Recharge: A Break for the Stressed Working Woman**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are very popular. Five journalists went to try out some of these places. Here are their experiences:

**Henlow Grange**

I spent six days at Henlow Grange, a beautiful 18th-century house. My room was very comfortable and relaxing. I started with a few days of doing nothing, but then I joined classes like yoga and body alignment. The instructors were highly trained and helped me feel more flexible. The spa offers many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and manicures. The staff were friendly, professional, and made me feel at ease. After my stay, I felt more relaxed and energized.

**Shrubland Hall**

Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. From the moment I arrived, I felt at ease. The hall has a big library, a charming conservatory, and plenty of space. Everyone gets a medical check-up when they arrive, which includes an examination and a check of their weight and blood pressure. I was impressed that they addressed a shoulder problem I had and helped me with exercises and individual instruction. The food was healthy and delicious, and I lost weight without feeling hungry. The atmosphere is peaceful and relaxing, and I left feeling wonderful.

**Careys Manor**

Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it's a lovely old manor house with a cozy lounge and a gym. The food is delicious, but if you're watching your calories, you might want to opt for a ""health-conscious"" diet. There are many treatments available, including massages and water therapy. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing. If you want to get some exercise, there's a fully-equipped gym and a pool.

**Cliveden**

Cliveden is a luxurious country house that treats its guests like royalty. It has a gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and many other activities. The food is amazing, with a choice of dishes that will make your mouth water. I had a facial and an aromatherapy massage, and I felt like a new person. The surroundings are beautiful, with stunning woodland walks and gardens. If you want to relax, there's a spa bath, steam room, and sauna.

**Springs Hydro**

Springs Hydro is a modern spa with luxurious bedrooms and up-to-date facilities. The food is delicious, but be careful of the carrot cake - it's huge and high in calories! The aromatherapy massage was amazing, and I slept better than I have in years. The staff are friendly and efficient, and there are many treatments available. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to mums and daughters, and I would love to go back.

Here is a simplified version of the text, making it suitable for a C1 learner:

For millions of years, humans and chimpanzees have been evolving separately, but genetically, we are still very similar. In fact, we share over 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees. This means that any differences between humans and animals must have developed relatively recently. Our physical and mental abilities, such as the capacity for art, are likely due to a small number of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many attributes once considered unique to humans are not exclusive to us. For example, chimpanzees use tools, and sea otters crack open shells with rocks. Monkeys even have a simple language, with different sounds for warning calls. These findings leave us with few absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art.

If human art originated from a unique genetic trait, it's surprising that our ancestors didn't develop it until recently. The earliest forms of human art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't preserve well. It wasn't until around 35,000 years ago that we have clear evidence of human art, in the form of cave paintings, statues, and musical instruments.

Three main differences between human art and animal activities are often cited: human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure, and it's transmitted through learning rather than genes. Let's examine these claims.

Firstly, human art is often described as useless, meaning it doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes. While human art may serve a purpose in communicating with others, this is different from passing on genes. In contrast, animal behaviors, such as bird songs, serve a clear purpose.

Secondly, it's argued that human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure, unlike animal activities like bird songs. While we can't ask birds about their intentions, it's likely that they sing for reasons other than just pleasure.

Thirdly, human art is often considered a learned activity, whereas animal behaviors are instinctive. However, human art styles can vary greatly between cultures and are learned through education. In contrast, some animals inherit their behaviors, such as bird songs, which they can produce even if they've never heard the tune.

Recent experiments have shown that even chimpanzees can create art for their own satisfaction, and some of their paintings were even sold. This blurs the distinction between human and animal art. Like human art, chimpanzee art was not created for a practical purpose, but rather for the artist's own enjoyment.<|eot_id|>"

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It's also one of the most challenging. Charles Blackmore crossed it, and lived to tell the tale. These days, it's rare to find people who take on big adventures like this. Charles Blackmore is one of them. He led an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert, which is also known as the Desert of Death. He and his team faced many dangers and challenges during their 59-day journey.

The team consisted of four British people, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The handlers had never worked with camels before, which was a big risk. They were actually long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have had serious consequences.

The team set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a book about their journey. He had just left the army after 14 years and wanted to do something new. He wanted to prove to himself that he could do it.

The journey was not easy. They suffered from dysentery, extreme temperatures, dehydration, and lost some of their water supply. But they also had some lucky breaks. They found water when they needed it most, and they didn't have to deal with the extreme cold or sandstorms.

What drove Charles Blackmore on was the need to survive. He was scared, but he knew he had the mental strength to do it. He was also scared of his physical ability, but he pushed through. At the end of the journey, he felt proud of what they had achieved.

Charles Blackmore is still inspired by his experience. He thinks about the desert and how they managed to overcome the challenges. He finds it hard to adjust to modern life, which is too routine for him. He misses the sense of purpose and adventure he had during his expedition.

Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. We use it to make our lives easier and free up more time for other activities. However, I recently had a frustrating experience with my malfunctioning word processor, which made me question whether technology is really worth the expense and hassle. I've started to phase out household technology, and I've discovered that manual labour can be beneficial for the environment and our well-being.

I've abandoned my malfunctioning word processor and taken up sewing by hand. This has allowed me to slow down and enjoy the process, listening to the radio or chatting with family and friends while I work. I've also regained control of my time, no longer feeling the need to rush to finish one task to move on to the next. I've even started to question whether we really need some of the modern appliances we use, like the freezer, microwave oven, and powered lawnmower.

Hurst is a perfectionist and is disappointed by the low-quality furniture often found today. He believes that many people settle for inferior furniture because they don't know what to look for. He, on the other hand, has a natural talent for making things and has learned his craft through self-study.

Most of Hurst's clients are private individuals who return to him again and again. He enjoys working with clients who know exactly what they want and are specific about their needs. However, he also acknowledges that not all clients are easy to work with. Some don't know what they want until it's too late, which can be frustrating.

Despite his confidence in his abilities, Hurst is humble and appreciative of other skilled craftsmen. He believes that a piece of furniture should be functional and beautiful, not just a statement piece. In the end, he says that he is just making furniture, and his goal is to create pieces that people will use and enjoy.

People spend about a third of their lives sleeping. It's clear that sleep plays a crucial role, but scientists still debate what exactly that role is. There are three main theories about why we sleep so much. The most widely accepted theory is that sleep helps to keep our bodies healthy. During sleep, our bodies repair any damage we've done during the day and get ready for the next day. Another theory suggests that sleep helps us learn and remember new things. It's believed that our brains process the information we gather during the day while we sleep, and that without sleep, we wouldn't be able to learn. The third theory is that sleep helps us recharge our energy levels. It's like recharging our batteries so we have enough energy for the next day.

What does it mean to be an eccentric? An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and doesn't fit the norms of society. But what is normal, anyway? We all have our own quirks and peculiarities. Maybe you have a passion for collecting something unusual, or you like to write letters to the editor about things that bother you. Being eccentric is about being true to yourself and expressing your individuality.

However, there's often a conflict within us between being our own person and fitting in with the crowd. Most of us prefer to conform and be accepted by others. We may even join groups or clubs to be with others who share our unusual interests. This shows that we crave connection and understanding from others.

We all struggle with this internal conflict between individuality and conformity. We might feel the need to stand out and be ourselves, but we also want to be accepted and liked by others. Some people even join groups or clubs to be with others who share their unusual interests. This desire for connection is strong.

But what makes someone truly eccentric? It's not just about doing something unusual for attention. A true eccentric is someone who is naturally different and doesn't worry about what others think. They simply do what they do because it's who they are. This is different from people who do unusual things to get attention or to make a point. The eccentric is not aware of the world around them; they just do what feels natural.

We asked four well-known naturalists to tell us about the wildlife book that has had the greatest influence on them. I, Geoffrey Lean, had the chance to meet many pioneers in the field of environmentalism. Among them, Barbara Ward stood out. She was a small, frail woman who had a deep understanding of environmental issues in post-war Europe. Her book, ""The Home of Man"", is particularly important to me. It's about the rapid growth of cities and the need for sustainable development. I haven't found a more eloquent and passionate plea for this idea in any other book.

Linda Bennett chose ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen. This book explains how animals communicate with each other. It's a fascinating topic, and the book is filled with beautiful pictures and words. After reading it, you can see the social structure of a group of gulls, how they work together, and even recognize individual birds.

Lee Durrell's choice is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book had a big impact on his life, not just because it led him to his future wife and a career in conservation, but also because it made him realize the importance of protecting the natural world. The book shows how animals and people are connected and that we need to work together to save the planet.

Bruce Pearson chose ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher. This book was in his school library when he was a child. He was drawn to it because of the beautiful pictures of birds by Eric Ennion. The book not only helped him learn to identify birds but also showed him that there is more to birds than just their physical characteristics. It opened his eyes to the connection between birds and art, literature, and music.

These books have had a significant impact on the lives of these naturalists, and they continue to inspire them to work towards protecting the natural world.<|eot_id|>"

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five British publishers about the impact of book reviews on a book's success. Here's what they said.

Publisher A Reviews are crucial for publishers. They found that readers often choose a book because of a positive review. Authors, on the other hand, are more concerned about getting any reviews at all. Publishers are more relaxed about negative reviews, thinking that a mix of positive and negative opinions can actually boost sales.

Publisher B Publishers and the press have different goals. Newspapers aim to entertain readers, while publishers want to promote their own books. In the past, book reviewing was more elitist, but it's now more diverse and inclusive. However, paperbacks are often overlooked, and publishers shouldn't complain too much, as reviews are an effective way to promote books and authors.

Publisher C Reviews are essential for publishers. Without them, they would struggle to reach readers. Since they don't advertise, they rely on literary editors to give space to their books. A good review can make a big difference, as readers trust the opinion of a respected reviewer.

Publisher D The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is complex. In the US, a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, it's harder to predict how reviews will affect sales. Some books receive rave reviews and still don't sell well, while others become bestsellers without much fanfare.

Publisher E Publishers and authors dream of glowing reviews, but do they really sell books? I published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it was a commercial failure. People seemed to think they didn't need to buy the book after reading the reviews. The name of the reviewer doesn't always matter; it's the quality and originality of the review that persuades readers to buy the book.

WEATHERVANE MAKER Graham Smith is one of the few people in the country who still makes hand-cut weathervanes, a craft that dates back to ancient Egyptian times. He creates unique, personalized designs for his customers. Many of his customers are women who want to give their husbands a special gift that reflects their interests or profession.

Graham's journey as a weathervane maker began when he surprised his wife with a witch on a broomstick weathervane. Friends liked it so much that they asked him to make more. Graham realized that the possibilities for designs were endless and decided to start a business. He had previously worked as a precision engineer, but he found it lacked artistic creativity. He enjoys the design aspect of his new job.

Graham has created over 100 original designs and works closely with his customers to ensure they are happy with the design before cutting the metal. He also keeps traditional designs in stock, as they are still popular. Graham likes that people appreciate the uniqueness of handcrafted items and the satisfaction of seeing a simple shape turn into a lifelike figure.

Weathervanes have been around for centuries, serving as a connection to the elements. Today, with more people moving to the countryside, people want to add a personal touch to their homes. Graham's business has become busier, with clients from around the world, including the US and Denmark, ordering his weathervanes. The price depends on the complexity of the design. Graham can create a special gift for any occasion.

Before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the most popular book of the year. It was the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it earned him a huge amount of money. Here, he talks about his inspiration and his success.

At the beginning of the year, Nicholas Evans had a difficult time. A film project he had been working on for months fell through, and he was worried about how he would make a living. He had not earned any money for two years, and his bank account was running low. A wise person might have gotten a job, but Evans decided to do something different. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

The idea for the story came from a conversation he had with a farrier (a person who takes care of horses) on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a horse that had changed from being friendly to being aggressive, and how a gypsy (a member of a nomadic group) was able to calm the horse down by talking to it. Evans was fascinated by this story and started researching more about horse whisperers.

Evans decided to write the story as a book instead of a screenplay. He traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. It was a difficult time for him, as he was struggling to make a living and was worried about his future.

When he finished the first half of the book, he showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was good and said Evans might get an advance of $30,000. Evans needed more money to pay off his debts, so he was disappointed by this offer. He decided to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book and sent it to seven publishers.

To his surprise, one of the publishers offered him $75,000, and then another publisher offered him $3 million. The novel was a huge success, and Evans became a famous author. He turned down an offer to write the screenplay for the book and decided to write another novel instead.<|eot_id|>"

Bobby Fischer, the famous chess player, is back in the game after 20 years of retirement. He is now 49 years old and is playing his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's first game was impressive, but it's clear that he is not the same player he was 20 years ago. He is out of practice and not as fit as he used to be. Spassky is also older, and the game of chess has changed a lot since Fischer's time.

In the past 20 years, professional chess has become more competitive and intense. Players need to be able to handle the pressure of the game, which includes a chess clock that limits the time they have to make their moves. The game is also becoming longer, with many matches lasting several hours. This has given an advantage to younger players, who are generally more energetic and able to handle the physical demands of the game.

Another important factor is the use of computers in chess. These days, players can access vast databases of games and analyze their opponents' strategies. This has made it harder for older players to compete with younger ones. The world's top 10 players are all under 30 years old, and many are supported by large teams of assistants who help them prepare for matches.

Fischer's match with Spassky will be a test of his skills, but it's not just about winning or losing. The prize money is significant, and both players will earn millions regardless of the outcome. However, if Fischer truly believes he can still be the best player in the world, the outcome could be disappointing for him.

He left school at 16, but returned a year later to study at the Young People's Theatre. Nick's passion for writing was sparked by his desire to write for actors, not just readers.

Simon Pegg, a 28-year-old comedian, has made a name for himself in the comedy world. He studied drama at Bristol University, but realized he was more interested in comedy than acting. Simon honed his skills in comedy clubs and eventually became a member of the comedy group Funny Business. He has also worked with comedian Steve Coogan, who discovered him.

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, rose to fame after starring in the TV series The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. He started acting at a young age, playing lead roles at school and later joining the Ulster Youth Theatre. Ciaran is now in a comfortable position, able to pick and choose his projects.

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil has been working towards his music career since leaving school at 16. He met his bandmate Rick Brown, who had connections in the music industry, and they formed Matrix.

Stephen Richards, a 27-year-old poet and author, has won numerous awards and honours. He has been touring and giving readings for six years and is now publishing his first novel, Hidden.

Volunteer tourism: a complex issue

Four experts discuss the pros and cons of international volunteering. Some argue that the actual impact of volunteering on development is limited. Volunteers often pay a fee to participate, which could be used to fund more effective local projects. This raises questions about the motivations behind volunteering, particularly for gap year travelers who may be seeking personal benefits rather than genuinely helping others.

On the other hand, volunteering can have positive effects. It can promote international understanding, conflict resolution, and global citizenship. It can also create networks and connections between people from different countries. However, if volunteering is only accessible to those from wealthy countries, it may perpetuate existing inequalities.

Volunteering can also be problematic. It can be seen as a form of imperialist charity, where wealthy individuals try to impose their values and ideas on others. Alternatively, it can be a way for individuals to gain skills and experience for their own careers. At its best, volunteering can provide a space for mutual learning and exchange between volunteers and local communities.

Some argue that volunteer tourism fits with the trend of individualized, non-political approaches to development. While this may seem positive, it can also avoid addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality. A more critical approach to volunteer tourism is needed, one that recognizes the complexities of global inequalities and the need for systemic change.

Many people listen to the radio in the morning to wake up. To make it easier to get out of bed, we use a clock radio. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, consisting of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five different models. We looked at their features and functions to see which one was the best.

One model had a ""dual alarm function"" that allowed you to set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. However, this function didn't work as expected. The instruction booklet suggested using it to set two different wake-up times, but most people's lives are not that organized. This model was more expensive than another one we tested, but it had a cassette player, which was a nice feature. You could fall asleep listening to your favorite music and wake up to a quiet morning.

We all liked the radio quality, but the clock radio was quite large. Paul Bridges said he needed space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone, and he was worried that the alarm might not go off. This model was the overall winner, and Paul Bridges said he was in love with it. The digital display was easy to read, and the snooze button was convenient.

However, some of us found it difficult to set up the clock radio. Tom Granger said the instructions were confusing, and he had to read them twice to get it working. The clock had a self-back-up feature, which was useful in case the power went out. But setting it up was a bit of a challenge.

We also tested a model with a built-in lamp, which was a nice feature. However, the lamp was hard to position, and it only shone on the clock, which was already illuminated. Tom Granger said the lamp was tacky and didn't work well. Paul Bridges liked the idea of the lamp, but he found the radio hard to tune.

Another model was the simplest and cheapest of the five. Tom Granger liked it because it was easy to set up and took up little space. It had old-fashioned dial tuning, which he preferred because it was more intuitive. The radio quality was good, and the buzzer worked well.

Overall, we tested five different clock radios and found that each had its pros and cons. We recommended the first model, which had the best features and was easy to use.<|eot_id|>"

Hedgehogs are small mammals covered in sharp spines. They can be found in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs have the ability to curl up into a ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outwards. This defense mechanism is effective, but it depends on the number of spines they have. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines and may try to run away from predators instead of curling up. They usually do this as a last resort.

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and spend most of the day sleeping. They often sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. While all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them choose to do so. In suitable conditions, some hedgehogs stay awake all year round.

D. Ffyona, a 24-year-old long-distance walker, has been walking around the world since she was 13. She's had many challenges, including blisters and heat exhaustion. She believes that men think women are more likely to fail, so they're less likely to sponsor them.

E. Lisa, a 26-year-old saloon car racer, says that men can be competitive and aggressive on the track. She has to be naturally competitive and aggressive to succeed. It's difficult to earn a living from the sport, and what she does earn goes back into it.

I still remember the day I met Picasso, the famous artist, when I was 18 years old. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco in a old van, trying to make a living by painting boats on the waterfront. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was an 80-year-old man, but he was still very recognizable. I was lucky to have my sketchbook with me, and I decided to approach him and ask for his signature. To my surprise, he agreed, and he even added a beautiful drawing on the page.

I was thrilled and started a conversation with him, but it was difficult because his English was limited. An American woman at the table acted as our translator. She kept calling him the Maestro, and I told him about my passion for art and my admiration for his work. After a while, my friend suggested I go back and draw his portrait. I was hesitant at first, but he encouraged me to do it.

So, I went back to Picasso's table and asked if I could draw him. He agreed, and he started acting out different expressions, making it difficult for me to draw him. He rolled his eyes, stuck out his tongue, and made funny faces. I was tempted to give up, but he seemed to be testing my persistence. Finally, he relaxed and let me study him for a few minutes. I was struck by his youthful appearance, his dark eyes, and his athletic build. He seemed to be a private person, even though he was surrounded by people.

When the American woman told me that the Maestro wanted to see my drawing, I was embarrassed, but he insisted on seeing it. He gave my drawing a nod of approval and then drew a portrait of me himself. His drawing was much better than mine, and he added a few quick strokes to capture my smile and my nose. I was amazed by his talent and his generosity. In the end, he signed my drawing, and I felt grateful for the experience.

Have you ever walked into a store and left with more than you intended to buy? Many stores use clever tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of the ways they do it:

A. Fresh and appealing

Supermarkets know that people love fresh food. They often put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance or display them in a beautiful way. They may also have a bakery that smells delicious, making you want to buy more. The store's color scheme can also influence your mood - for example, green is often used because it reminds people of fresh produce.

B. Displaying products effectively

The way products are displayed in a store can greatly affect how well they sell. Supermarkets use computers to track which areas of the store are most popular and place their most profitable products there. They also use special displays and promotions to attract customers.

C. Placing staples strategically

Supermarkets often place everyday items like bread, tea, and sugar in hard-to-reach areas of the store. This means you have to pass by more expensive items to get to them. Chain stores may also place their most popular products in less accessible areas, hoping you'll buy other things along the way.

D. Making products look exclusive

Some stores use special displays to make their products look exclusive. For example, fashion stores may display limited quantities of clothing to make it seem like the items are rare. This can make customers feel like they're getting a special deal.

E. Tempting totals

Supermarkets know that people are more likely to buy more if they can see the total cost of their shopping at the end. They often mix low-priced and high-priced items to keep you interested. Some stores may even sell certain items at a loss to get you to come in and buy more.

F. The importance of pricing

When shopping at chain stores, you may notice that prices are more important. Stores may use special pricing to make certain items seem more appealing. This can also help prevent theft by employees.

G. Lighting

Stores use lighting to create a welcoming atmosphere. Supermarkets may use special lighting to make food look more appealing, while chain stores may use natural light to show off clothing colors.

H. Guiding shoppers

Some stores use different carpeting to guide customers through the store. This can encourage you to follow a certain path and visit different areas of the store.

I. In-store promotions

Supermarkets use big pictures and advertisements to make you want to buy more. Some stores even have special screens on shopping carts that show you ads as you shop. This can increase sales by up to 30%.<|eot_id|>"

Robin Knox-Johnston, a sailor, is known for being the first person to sail solo around the world in 1968-1969. He holds the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the UK from New York.

Chris and Robin teamed up to explore Greenland by sea and on foot. They wrote a book about their adventure, Sea, Ice and Rock. Chris was working on his book Quest for Adventure when he met Robin and asked for an interview. Robin suggested they go sailing and climbing together, and Chris agreed. They sailed to a remote area and anchored the boat. Chris showed Robin some climbing techniques, and Robin taught Chris some sailing skills.

On their first trip to Skye, Chris and Robin formed a strong friendship. Robin suggested they combine their skills on a trip to Greenland, which Chris agreed to. Chris was impressed by Robin's leadership skills, as he consulted everyone before making decisions. Chris found sailing to be boring and difficult, but Robin enjoyed it. Chris felt a bit useless at times, as Robin was more skilled at sailing.

When they reached Greenland, Chris had to take responsibility for Robin's safety, which was challenging. Chris underestimated the difficulty of climbing the highest mountain, Cathedral, and was worried about Robin's lack of climbing experience. However, Robin was determined and followed Chris's lead. On the way back, they had a disagreement on the yacht, but Chris realized he had misjudged Robin's intentions and they were able to resolve their issue.

Apples have been around for thousands of years, and they come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. However, in the late 20th century, the world was in danger of losing its apple heritage. 

Prehistoric humans started eating apples around 8,000 BC. They took apple seeds with them when they migrated to new areas, and they even dried apple halves for winter storage. These early apples were small and not like the apples we know today.

In the 1st century AD, the Romans brought new fruit-growing skills to Europe. They introduced the dessert apple, which became popular in Britain. Over time, British monks developed new apple varieties, and these are the ancestors of most modern apples.

In the 13th century, several types of apples became popular in Britain. One of the most famous was the Old English Pearmain, which was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Another popular apple was the Costard, which was sold in markets and gave us the word ""costermonger.""

In the 16th century, Henry VIII ordered his chief fruit supplier to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. This led to the development of new apple varieties, including the famous Pippins.

As apples became more popular, settlers took them with them when they traveled to new countries, such as Canada, Australia, and the United States. In North America, John Chapman, also known as ""Johnny Appleseed,"" planted apple seeds and nurseries across the country.

In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer in Iowa discovered a new apple variety, which he named ""Delicious."" This apple became one of the most widely grown in the world. Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith, who worked as a midwife and maintained a farm and orchard.

Today, apples are grown all over the world, but many varieties have been lost due to commercialization and a focus on a few popular types. However, consumers are starting to demand more variety, and it is important to protect and value natural diversity in apples and other foods.

Richard Nerurkar, a top British long-distance runner, visited the Kenyan high-altitude training camp. The camp is located 10 miles south of the equator, near the foot of Mount Kenya, the country's highest peak. For the past three years, I have been training at this camp during the winter months. However, this was my first time training with Kenyan runners on their home soil.

I was invited to stay at the Kenyan national team training camp, where the country's top runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000-meter race and was invited by the national team coach. Training at high altitude increases the production of red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity. This has been proven by the success of generations of Kenyan runners.

My first African race was also a historic event, as it was the first-ever international cross-country race held on African soil. Although I finished behind 38 Kenyan runners, I felt I had a good race. Kenyan runners are known for their simple and uncomplicated approach to running, as well as their love for competing.

However, the key to their success is not just the altitude. I stayed with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp, where I learned about their training routine. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet above sea level, surrounded by beautiful fields and dense vegetation. The athletes live in simple dormitories and have a strict training schedule, with three workouts per day.

The day starts at 6 am with a leisurely run, followed by interval training and a steady run in the afternoon. The total distance covered each day is around 40 kilometers. On Sundays, they have a shorter run of 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is uncomplicated, with a simple breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu. After training, they take a bath in one of the nearby streams.

By the time I left the camp, I had a new appreciation for Kenyan success. It's not just genetics, upbringing, or altitude that contributes to their success. I believe it's the purity and simplicity of their lifestyle, their grueling workouts, and their passion for success that make them the best distance runners in the world.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Advertising is struggling. It's not just the economic downturn. Advertising has been declining since 1989, even before the recession started. The problem is that advertisers are not adapting to the changing market. They still think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but with so many brands and media options, target audiences have become smaller and more fragmented. Even big brands rarely target specific minority groups.

Think about your own shopping habits. You might buy 30-50 items at a supermarket, but most of them won't be advertised brands. You might only buy a few hundred brands in a year, and even fewer will be advertised brands. In fact, you're unlikely to buy more than 400 different brands in a year. Yet, there are over 32,000 branded goods and services being advertised. This means that most advertising is wasted, as you're not likely to buy most of the products being advertised.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16, which means 94% of commercials are wasted. You might think you're immune to advertising, but you're not. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. People only register a small number of ads and ignore the rest.

Advertising can be effective, but it's expensive and often wasteful. To make it more effective, advertisers need to target specific groups more precisely. They can't know in advance who will respond to their ads, so they have to reach a large number of people to reach the right minority. This is one of the main differences between advertising and face-to-face sales. Even the most targeted direct mail campaigns can't achieve a 100% response rate.

To make advertising more effective, advertisers need to focus on targeting specific groups more precisely. They need to stop wasting money on advertising to people who won't respond. Any campaign that can win over 2% of the population would be considered successful. The most effective way to reach these people may be through mass media, but advertisers need to adapt to the changing market and target their message more precisely.<|eot_id|>"

Charles Clover visits the most environmentally-friendly home in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. The town is full of surprises, including Britain's least-known ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, which features pagan figures carved into its 13th-century chapter house. The other surprise is the 'autonomous house', designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. This house is powered by rainwater, recycled sewage, and waste heat from appliances and human body heat. The house looks like a traditional one, with a clay-tiled roof, and is located near the Minster. When you enter the house, you'll notice it's extremely quiet due to its super-insulation and triple-glazed windows. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, designed the house to be environmentally friendly long before it became a popular topic. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s and aimed to create a building that emitted no carbon dioxide. They also designed a system for collecting and reusing rainwater, and installed composting toilets. The Vales don't use a dishwasher because they believe it's morally wrong to use strong detergents. They wanted to show that it's possible to design a house that's less harmful to the environment without sacrificing comfort. The house has no water bills, and last winter it used only 9 units of electricity per day, which is less than average. Soon, the house will generate its own electricity and even charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, which the Vales rarely use. The house is warm in winter, and the temperature is comfortable because of its insulation and design. The Vales believe that people should learn to live with less technology and less waste, and that this house is a good example of how to achieve this.<|eot_id|>"

Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was known for being a rational person. However, in 1920, he was convinced that photographs of fairies taken in a garden were real. He wrote an article and published the photos, believing that fairies were supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that they had faked them. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The photos are still beautiful, but the trick shows that the camera is not always honest. In fact, photographers have always been able to manipulate their images. Today, with computer software, we can easily edit our digital photos. It's a myth that photography was once completely honest. From the very beginning, photographers have been able to change the way things look in their pictures.

For centuries, iron has fascinated people and the blacksmiths who work with it have been highly respected. In the past, blacksmiths were seen as skilled craftsmen who provided essential tools and equipment. They were considered to be on the same level as doctors and astrologers. Eighteenth-century blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for famous buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. In the past, blacksmiths were in high demand, but with the Industrial Revolution, their skills became less needed. By the 1960s, blacksmiths were almost extinct in Britain. However, there has been a recent revival in interest in decorative architecture and interior design, which has led to a renewed appreciation for blacksmiths' skills.

Despite this, much of the current work looks similar to traditional styles, with manufacturers advertising their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style"". However, there are some talented blacksmiths who are creating unique and beautiful pieces. The British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is promoting the craft through an exhibition at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. The exhibition features over 250 pieces of forged ironwork, including bookends, a spiral staircase, and other decorative items. The prices range from £90 to over £1,000.

The blacksmiths are excited about the new possibilities that power tools have brought, allowing them to create intricate designs with ease. They enjoy working with iron because of its unique properties - it is soft when hot and hard when cold. One blacksmith, Alan Dawson, says that iron is a material that allows them to express themselves creatively. The exhibition aims to promote good ironwork and support individual makers, with a percentage of the proceeds going towards promoting the craft.

The blacksmiths are passionate about their work, and many are fascinated by the challenges and possibilities of working with iron. They enjoy the process of shaping the metal when it is hot, and the sense of satisfaction they get from creating something beautiful and functional. As one blacksmith, Susan May, says, ""It's quite magical, because it's incredibly soft when it's hot, but as soon as it cools down, it becomes really rigid and immovable again.""<|eot_id|>"

I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was furious. 'Why didn't you stop years ago?' she asked. I couldn't explain why I suddenly stopped smoking after a session with a stop-smoking group. It was a mix of group therapy and hypnosis, and it happened two months ago. I didn't plan to quit and didn't really want to. I was annoyed with the pressure to stop smoking and had always thought I was healthy enough not to need to quit. I had low blood pressure and a long-lived family, and I didn't cough or feel unwell. I went to the stop-smoking session to write an article about others who were trying to quit.

I told the counselor I wasn't going to try to quit, as I was just writing about it. But during the session, I noticed that I didn't want to smoke as much as I used to. The room was filled with smoke, but I didn't feel the urge to smoke as much as the others did. I think it was because the idea of quitting made sense to me. It was like a challenge, and the thought of not being a smoker made me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that was just between me and myself.

Quitting was easier than I thought it would be. The physical cravings went away after a few days, and I didn't have any trouble working without cigarettes. The only difficult part was finding things to do on weekends, as I used to use smoking to fill my time. I do miss cigarettes sometimes, but not too much. I have to get used to new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane, where I would have normally smoked.<|eot_id|>"

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won the Nobel Prize, but many people in the UK don't know much about her. I've been asking friends and acquaintances about her, and most of them haven't heard of her. This is surprising, considering she was the only British woman to win a Nobel Prize in science. I decided to write a biography about her to raise awareness about her achievements.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a remarkable person who made significant contributions to science. She was born in 1910 and died in 1994. Her life reflects the major changes that took place in the 20th century, such as the advancement of women's education and the globalization of science.

When I started researching her life, I found that there were few scientific biographies available. This is surprising, considering the importance of science in our lives. Many scientists believe that their lives are not interesting enough to be written about, but this is not true. Scientists, like artists and writers, have unique experiences and stories to share.

Fortunately, there are signs that this is changing. Scientists are now more willing to share their personal stories and experiences with the public. This can help to dispel the myth that science is boring and make it more accessible to everyone.

Dorothy Hodgkin's life is a great example of this. She was a devoted scientist who made significant contributions to our understanding of the structure of molecules. She was also a devoted mother and wife, and her personal life is an inspiration to many people. Her story shows that science and personal life are not separate, but interconnected.

Writing a biography about Dorothy Hodgkin has been a challenging task. I've had to explain complex scientific concepts in a way that is easy to understand. However, I believe that understanding science is not difficult - it just requires application and interest. It's sad that many people are not aware of the achievements of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, but I hope that my biography will help to change this.<|eot_id|>"

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability to find water. She uses a forked hazel rod to detect water underground. Many farmers whose wells have dried up hire her services. She works with her husband, who uses modern technology to drill wells. But when it comes to finding water, Margaret relies on her ""sixth sense"". 

Dowsing, the ability to locate water, minerals, and lost objects, is a mysterious skill. There are many theories about how it works, from physical forces like magnetism to spiritual explanations. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and dowsers can sense these vibrations. Some dowsers claim they can ""feel"" or ""smell"" water.

The Wilkins have been very busy during the recent drought. They have a long waiting list of customers, mostly farmers with dry wells. They also work with people who own remote cottages or holiday homes where it's expensive to run water pipes. Margaret tries to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She looks for areas where the water is likely to be clean and safe.

To start, Margaret uses a map and a pendulum to locate likely areas. Then, she walks over the fields with her forked hazel stick. When she's above water, she gets a strange feeling, and the stick rises up. Her husband also dowses the area, and they usually agree on the exact spot to drill. If they don't agree, they won't drill and will keep searching until they do.

Margaret's ability to find water is not unique. Anthropologists and writers have studied this mysterious skill for a long time. Margaret calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment"", which is the closest explanation we have for why she's so accurate. Without this ability, the family wouldn't be able to run their well-drilling business.<|eot_id|>"

She helped with milking cows, feeding calves, and inspecting sheep. She found it a lonely day and missed the interaction with children.

Hilary, a teacher, swapped with Rosemary and found it challenging to keep up with the fast-paced school environment.

Hakan Hardenberger is a renowned trumpet player who started his musical journey without any family background in music. Born in southern Sweden, he was given a trumpet as a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, chose a real trumpet instead of a toy one. Hakan was immediately hooked and never stopped playing. His mother managed to get him lessons from the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who recognized Hakan's natural talent.

Hardenberger credits his teacher for helping him develop his unique sound. He believes that the trumpet is a primitive instrument and that imperfections are inevitable. He has learned to accept and work with these imperfections to create a distinctive sound. Unlike other virtuoso trumpet players, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist, inspired by the French trumpeter Maurice Andre.

Hardenberger's parents supported his ambition to become a professional musician, and he went to study in Paris with Pierre Thibaud at the age of 16. Thibaud encouraged him to enter competitions, and Hakan's first experience was a competition at the age of 17. Although he didn't win first prize, he realized that people listened to him and enjoyed his performance. Hardenberger believes that his ability to communicate with his audience is a gift, and he is careful not to analyze it too much, as he thinks it might ruin the magic of the music.

**Getting Ahead at Work: The Power of Leadership**

A good leader is someone who inspires others, brings about change, and shows the way forward. Leadership is not about physical characteristics like height or intelligence. It's about making things happen through people who share your enthusiasm and passion. A good leader should be able to express themselves clearly and confidently.

According to Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference,"" leadership is about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think."" This confidence is essential for conveying enthusiasm and encouraging others to share your vision.

John van Maurik, director of a leadership course, believes that everyone has the potential to be a leader. It's about recognizing and developing your natural talents and using them effectively.

In our daily work, we may not always recognize leadership qualities in ourselves or others. However, effective leadership is crucial for success in any organization. A good leader motivates and supports their team members, whereas a poor leader can make them feel unimportant and unvalued.

Managers and leaders are not the same thing. Managers focus on following established procedures, while leaders create their own path. A good leader can transform an organization, whereas a good manager can only maintain the status quo.

Whether you're a manager or an employee, improving your leadership skills can benefit you. Here are some tips:

* Identify your passions and convictions and take action on them.
* Recognize your ability to lead and use it to your advantage.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from your mistakes.
* Develop your communication skills and be open to feedback.
* Set goals and work towards them, and be willing to delegate and motivate others.
* Don't assume that your leadership style will always be successful; be willing to adapt and learn from others.

Remember, leadership is not something that happens overnight. It requires effort, practice, and patience. By developing your leadership skills, you can enhance your effectiveness and career prospects.<|eot_id|>"

Film Reviews by Nick James

A. Abyss

James Cameron's Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine is an intense and suspenseful film. The characters, led by foreman Bud, are well-portrayed, and the special effects are impressive. However, the dialogue and character development could be better.

B. The Thin Red Line

This war film, based on James Jones' novel, is a counterpart to Terrence Malick's version. While Malick's film is more poetic and complex, Marton's version is more straightforward and true to the book. The film focuses on a single soldier and his relationship with his sergeant. The flashback sequence is particularly effective.

C. On Guard

This swashbuckling adventure is loosely based on Paul Feval's novel. The film has a memorable villain and a hero who is both charming and skilled. The production design and costume design are impressive, and the film's tone is light-hearted and entertaining.

D. Character

This period drama is set in turn-of-the-century Rotterdam and focuses on the relationship between a brutal bailiff and his son. The film's production design and costume design are detailed, but the story feels slow and lacks depth.

E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

This classic western has been re-released on video and showcases director Leone's craftsmanship. The sound editing is particularly impressive, and the music is iconic. The story is brutal and intense, and the characters are morally ambiguous.

F. The Longest Day

This epic war film features an all-star cast and four directors. While the film is impressive in terms of logistics, it feels overly long and would be better suited to the big screen. The video release is a diminished experience compared to seeing it in a theater.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

BOOK A Steve Martin's Compelling Evidence is a gripping story. The main character, a lawyer, is forced to defend his former boss's wife who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial is full of suspense and the outcome is uncertain until the very end. This is a great debut in the mystery genre.

BOOK B Curtains for the Cardinal starts with a dramatic event and follows Sigismondo, a troubleshooter for the Italian aristocracy, as he becomes involved in a complex web of politics, intrigue, and murder. Although the book is a bit long, it's still an exciting read.

BOOK C File Under: Deceased introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, a tax inspector who finds herself investigating a murder. Despite facing challenges and disapproval, Leah is a strong and capable character. This is a refreshing change from traditional detectives.

BOOK D Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker features his famous detective, Spenser, who helps his friend Hawk to clean up a troubled neighborhood in Boston. The book has fast-paced dialogue and a mix of action and philosophy.

BOOK E False Prophet by Faye Kellermann follows detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn as they investigate a burglary at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's writing style makes this an engaging mystery.

BOOK F Blood Red, Snow White by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock is a suspense novel about a lawyer who defends a woman accused of a crime. The story is full of romance, money, and violence, making it an engrossing read.

BOOK G Dead for a Ducat by Simon Shaw is a comedy about an actor who is supposed to play Robin Hood, but things don't go as planned. The book has a cast of colorful characters, but the story is not as strong as some of Shaw's other works.

BOOK H Fall Down Easy by Lawrence Gough is a detective novel about a bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the clever robber make this a standout novel in the genre.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

At 34, Tim Pozzi has decided to leave his job and go backpacking. He's wondering why he and others in their 30s are taking the leap. This summer, I quit my job and plan to rent out my flat and travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 and nervous. I've traveled before, but I've been stuck in a routine and haven't felt fulfilled. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I now have no responsibilities, and many of my friends are envious of my freedom.

I'm nervous because I'm not sure if I can adjust to a more basic way of life. I've been used to a certain standard of living, and I worry about feeling out of place among younger backpackers. However, I'm not alone. Many Britons in their 20s and 30s are realizing that adventure is within reach. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet, says that people are becoming aware that they can have the opportunity to travel whenever they want, as long as they're brave and organized.

For some, traveling is a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. Danny and Tammy, a couple in their 20s, are taking a year-long trip around the world. For others, like Matt, who left the army, traveling was a way to break free from a rigid routine. There are many reasons why people in their 30s are traveling, but there are common factors. More people are working on short-term contracts, and companies are even offering career breaks.

For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, an increasing number of thirty-somethings are taking stock of their lives. He believes that people are no longer afraid to ask themselves if they're happy with their lives and are willing to take a chance to reassess and find a more balanced life. Is traveling just a sign of our generation's inability to grow up? Jennifer Cox doesn't think so. She believes it's a sign of a more educated and stable society that values living a balanced life.

I'm excited about my upcoming trip, but I'm also a bit apprehensive about leaving behind my comfortable routine. I'm not sure if I'd be doing this if I hadn't found my boss so unbearable. For me, this trip is about grabbing life by the horns and taking a chance. Whatever the outcome, I'll be proud of myself for taking the leap.<|eot_id|>"

I took a break from my journalism career and felt out of touch with the rapid changes in technology. I decided to transform my home into an efficient workplace. I realized that I needed to update my skills and knowledge to stay relevant in the industry. I entered a competition and won a computer package, which included a laptop and a personal computer for my family. This allowed me to work from home and take care of my children.

At first, I was hesitant to use the computer, but my children were already familiar with it from school. I learned the basic skills I needed and soon became more confident. I started freelancing for a magazine and was able to work efficiently, managing my time and tasks effectively.

The computer has greatly improved my working style. I no longer lose important information, and spreadsheets help me keep track of my income and expenses. I can also research stories and communicate with other professionals online. However, there are some challenges to working from home, such as feeling isolated and dealing with distractions.

According to a report, the typical home computer user is 38 years old and well-educated. They own a personal computer, CD-ROM device, and modem. I seem to fit this profile, and I'm excited to see where my career will take me in the future. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be publishing my own magazine from home.

The National Museum of Scotland is a modern building with a unique design. Its exterior is striking, with a large yellow sandstone tower and a unique shape. The building was met with mixed reactions when it first opened, with some people loving it and others not so much. Now that the inside is almost ready, the exhibits are set to be just as impressive.

The museum tells the story of Scotland's history, with each exhibit centered around a special object. The exhibits are arranged in a way that helps visitors understand the timeline, but doesn't constrain the displays. The museum shows off Scotland's treasures, such as Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the silver from the Holyrood chapel, without overwhelming visitors with national pride.

The real question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to come back. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, wants visitors to have a pleasurable experience and believes the museum is designed for people with little prior knowledge. He's a purist when it comes to what's on display, rejecting mock-ups and scenes from the past that rely on imagination. Instead, the museum shows what the experts know.

The museum uses a combination of explanation panels, captions, and multimedia interpretation to tell the stories of the objects on display. With only 30 computers throughout the museum, it's not clear if the stories will be told vividly enough. Some parts of the museum are already impressive, such as the panoramic views of Edinburgh Castle and the sequence of spaces that open into each other. The museum also has a Discovery Centre, designed for children, and a temporary exhibition on the top floor that will change every three years.

Overall, the museum's modern architecture works well from the inside and top, but its location is another matter.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the passage at a level suitable for C1 learners:

""The end of print newspapers may not be imminent. The idea of transition is often met with fear and uncertainty, but it can also be a gradual and natural process. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is a different story. This process is uncertain and challenging because it may not be a smooth transition at all.

Despite the decline in print newspaper sales, online visits to the same papers' websites are increasing. The latest figures show that The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and many other newspapers have seen a decline in print circulation, but their online readership is growing. However, this trend is not uniform and may be influenced by various factors such as timing, demographics, and geography.

Some experts argue that the crisis in the newspaper industry is mainly affecting print newspapers, while others claim that online newspapers are the future. However, the latest survey by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, with sales in Asia making up for the decline in the West.

The situation is similar in the magazine industry, where news and current affairs magazines have seen a 5.4% increase in sales. In the book industry, e-readers are popular, but sales of physical books have not declined significantly.

The idea that young people are abandoning newspaper-reading is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15-35 still follow the main national dailies. Different countries have different trends, with some experiencing a significant decline in print circulation, while others have seen a smaller decline or even an increase.

The varying national trends suggest that the situation is more complex than the proponents of the digital revolution assume. The assumption that online advertising revenues would pay for the transition and make online newspapers successful has not come true. Many US newspapers have built paywalls around their products, but the best way to attract paying readers is to offer a joint package of print and digital access.

Print is still an important tool in selling internet subscriptions, and its advertising rates are significantly higher than online rates. However, maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is challenging, complex, and expensive. Newspaper brands still have a strong presence in print, but online, it is harder to be noticed.""

**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects in photography. A picture with someone in it is often more engaging than the same shot without a person. However, photographing people can be challenging. The photographer must consider not only technical and artistic aspects but also the subject's actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of the camera can sometimes have a negative effect on these.

**Group Shots**

When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or have some sit or kneel in front to make it easier to see everyone's faces.

**Posing for Pictures**

People often stiffen up when taking pictures. Help your subject relax by suggesting a comfortable position, such as folding their arms or putting them in their pockets.

**Approaching the Subject**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when it's clear you are. Most people will agree to be photographed and are flattered by it. However, they may become self-conscious, so you may need to direct them.

**Eye Contact**

A picture gains impact when the subject looks directly at the camera. Ask your subject to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. You may need to remind them to look at the camera just before taking the shot.

**Candid Concentration**

An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to focus on something within the picture area. This can be easier for them and create a sense of observation.

**Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures can tell us more about the subject than anything else. Look for familiar expressions like smiles, winks, or tears to add emotional depth to your photos.

**Situational Interest**

The subject's background or environment can add interest and information to the picture. Try to exclude irrelevant details and blur them if necessary. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.

**Interaction**

When photographing multiple people, look for moments of interaction, such as eye contact, physical contact, or reactions to each other.

**People and Places**

When taking pictures of people in a new location, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move back to capture the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so that they form a foreground interest without obscuring the background.

**To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you're taking the picture. If it's to remember someone, a posed picture might be suitable. However, candid shots of events as they happen are often more engaging and memorable.

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist who creates paintings that deceive the eye, making them look like reality. In this interview, she talks to Joanna Watt about her work. Sarah is not interested in promoting herself as an artist, but rather in the art itself. She believes that the artist's ego is not important, and that the work should speak for itself.

Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for 16 years, after studying art and illustration. She started her career by working for a specialist decorator, Jim Smart, who asked her to do one trompe-l'oeil painting. This sparked her interest in the technique, and she eventually set up her own business. Sarah's skills in observation and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, have been essential for her success in trompe-l'oeil.

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil is a skill that cannot be taught, but rather learned through experience and observation. She is still learning and improving, and is critical of her own work, pointing out its flaws. Sarah is also honest about her limitations, admitting that she struggles with certain subjects, such as painting bread, which often looks like grey concrete.

Sarah's work is highly regarded, and she has a string of major commissions behind her. Her paintings often feature architectural settings, and she is known for her ability to create the illusion of depth and space. She believes that trompe-l'oeil must engage the viewer's imagination, and that it is important to understand the client's vision and work with them to create a scheme that is personal to them.

Sarah is grateful for her clients, who she describes as ""mad"" and willing to let her loose on their walls. She is proud of her work, but prefers to let it speak for itself, rather than drawing attention to her own talent. Despite her humility, her work is highly regarded, and she is constantly busy with commissions.<|eot_id|>"

Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success

The way we work is changing. We're no longer judged solely on our intelligence, skills, and experience. Instead, we're being evaluated on how well we work with others and manage our own emotions. This new standard is crucial for getting hired, advancing in our careers, and even staying relevant in the job market. 

Emotional intelligence is about being able to understand and manage our own emotions, as well as those of others. It involves skills like empathy, initiative, adaptability, and persuasiveness. In today's workplace, where job security is uncertain and jobs are constantly changing, emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly important.

Businesses are recognizing the value of emotional intelligence and are incorporating it into their management strategies. In fact, companies that prioritize emotional intelligence tend to perform better and have a competitive edge. Emotional intelligence is not just about being nice or being good at emotional manipulation. It's about being able to manage our emotions and those of others in a way that helps us work together effectively towards a common goal.

The good news is that emotional intelligence can be developed and improved over time. In fact, research shows that people tend to become more emotionally intelligent as they gain experience and mature. This means that we can all work on developing our emotional intelligence and adding it to our toolkit for success.

While emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success, it is a crucial component of being successful in today's fast-changing job market. Ignoring emotional intelligence can lead to poor performance and stagnation, but developing it can lead to greater success and stability.<|eot_id|>"

Should the media use photos and videos they didn't take? With smartphones, it's easier than ever to capture important news events. Social media has changed the way news is reported, with people sharing photos and videos in real-time. Some journalists are now using social media as a source of images, especially for breaking news. However, some reporters have used photos and videos without asking permission. This has sparked a debate about whether it's right to do so. Research shows that many people would take photos or videos of news events, so user-generated content (UGC) is important for the media. To maintain a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people are fairly compensated for their work and always ask for permission to use their content.

Changes made:

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for over 2,000 years. It involves inserting fine needles into the skin to stimulate the body's energy, known as Qi. The goal is to restore balance to the body and relieve pain. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but its effectiveness in relieving pain has been most studied and accepted by Western doctors.

The concept of Qi is central to traditional Chinese medicine. It is believed that Qi flows through the body along specific pathways, or meridians, and that an imbalance of Qi can lead to illness. During an acupuncture session, the practitioner will assess the patient's overall health, including their pulse, tongue, and physical condition, to identify areas of imbalance.

There are over 300 points on the body where acupuncture needles can be inserted. These points are related to the meridians and are not necessarily located near the area of pain. Patients often report a mild, tingling sensation when the needle is inserted, which indicates that the Qi has been stimulated.

While some Western doctors do not accept the concept of Qi, many have found that acupuncture can be effective in relieving pain. There are several theories about how acupuncture works, including the idea that it can block pain signals to the brain or release natural pain-relieving chemicals.

Acupuncture is commonly used to treat chronic pain, including back pain, arthritis, and headaches. It is also used to treat other types of pain, such as menstrual pain and pain associated with terminal illnesses. In recent years, acupuncture has been used as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery, with some patients reporting reduced pain and fewer side effects.

While the effectiveness of acupuncture is difficult to measure, many studies have shown that it can be effective for chronic pain relief, with success rates ranging from 50 to 80%. Acupuncturists typically recommend a series of sessions to achieve optimal results, and some patients may experience improvement after just a few visits.

Acupuncture is a holistic approach to pain management, taking into account not just the physical symptoms but also the patient's overall well-being and lifestyle. This approach can be quite different from Western medicine, which often focuses on specific symptoms and treatments. When choosing an acupuncturist, it is important to find one who is qualified and experienced, and to consult with a medical doctor if necessary.

But she's actually a shy person. She admits that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is based on herself if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone and needs quiet time to write. She can write anywhere as long as it's private.

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is gaining popularity. In some countries, employers ask for handwriting samples during job interviews. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a legitimate science in many countries. Researchers believe it can be a useful tool to identify certain health issues, such as heart disease and cancer, and to understand a person's mental state and emotional well-being.

Many companies now employ graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential employees for key positions. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain skeptical about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can reveal a person's psychological characteristics, medical conditions, and potential.

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in identifying potential criminal tendencies. She claims that criminals often have distinctive handwriting, such as poor letter formation and repeated letters. Graphologists can also use handwriting to predict whether someone is honest, manipulative, or a reliable employee.

Ms. Marne suggests that handwriting can also reveal other psychological traits, such as emotional stability, sensitivity, and confidence. For example, people with handwriting that forms ""threads"" instead of individual letters are likely to be devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals may be trying to hide their true selves. Very light pressure on the pen can indicate sensitivity and a lack of vitality.

Ms. Marne emphasizes that becoming a skilled graphologist requires six years of study and experience, combined with empathy and intuition. She believes that more research is needed to establish graphology as a legitimate scientific discipline. Some psychiatrists are critical of graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic ability, and writing style, and has no other significance.

A new survey suggests that a happy and healthy workforce is linked to fresh air and suitable chairs. We visited four offices to see how healthy and happy they were as working environments. Our expert panel consisted of a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their assessments.

Office A: Advertising Agency

The building health consultant said that this office is very basic, with no central heating or ventilation, and windows that open directly onto the street. However, the employees, who are part of a small, dynamic team, seem to be happy. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and windows or using electric radiators, just like they would at home. This might be the key: the team has created a cozy and homely working environment, without any bureaucracy imposed from outside.

The ergonomist noted that the furniture is varied and not very suitable for working comfortably. However, the employees have a varied schedule, which includes office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom, and physical problems.

The occupational psychologist found that the staff are delighted with the variety of work and the flexibility of the office space. They said that the office is ""just the right size"" - small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but large enough to focus on personal work. The office is both attractive and fun, conveying a sense of efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service

The building health consultant said that this office is comfortable and well-maintained, with good air quality and a no-smoking policy. The ergonomist praised the excellent chairs, good lighting, and computer equipment. However, the space could be improved by better layout and more visual stimulation.

The occupational psychologist noted that the office is impersonal and lacks visual interest, with bare walls and few decorations. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could be improved by positioning desks to facilitate sharing of information and displaying success stories or project updates on the walls.

Office C: Bank

The building health consultant said that this office is mixed in terms of how people feel about it. The atmosphere is like being in a showcase, with many similar exhibits on display. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air doesn't seem stale, even when someone is smoking nearby.

The ergonomist found the office to be uninspiring, with standard furniture that is barely adequate. Not all chairs are suitable for computer use, and some are user-chosen. Computer screens are often on small desk units with lowered keyboard shelves, which is no longer considered suitable for modern equipment.

The occupational psychologist noted that staff are supportive and well-equipped with technology. There are many communication awards on display, and the wood-colored paneling and brown carpet give a slightly somber atmosphere. The office is bustling with activity.

Office D: Newspaper

The building health consultant said that it's hard to find anything positive about this building. The air-conditioning is crude, resulting in large temperature variations. The space is cluttered, and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is dusty, with many places for dust to accumulate. The shed-like roof also collects dust, which falls on those sitting below when disturbed.

The ergonomist found the furniture to be unsuitable for a high-tech industry, with most chairs being of little value for keyboard users, especially those under 1.75 meters tall. Many chairs are old, lack adjustment, and have armrests that prevent users from getting close to the desk.

The occupational psychologist noted that the office is dirty, with old brown chairs, soiled carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement, including tidying up, recognizing individual success, improving air conditioning, and adopting a team-working policy. When we visited, few conversations were happening, and everyone seemed stressed and driven by deadlines.<|eot_id|>"

Chewing gum is a popular habit that has been around for thousands of years. Today, Americans alone chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. But have you ever wondered how this habit started? Let's take a journey through time and find out.

In ancient Greece, people chewed a type of gum made from the bark of the mastic tree. Women especially liked it because it helped keep their teeth clean and fresh. Later, American colonists adopted a similar habit, chewing resin that formed on spruce trees.

The modern chewing gum we know today has its roots in the 1860s, when people discovered a milky substance called chicle, which comes from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This new type of gum was smoother, more satisfying, and more elastic, and soon a whole industry was born.

However, cultivating sapodilla trees has been a challenge. Today, only a few people, called chicleros, still gather sapodilla, facing many dangers and difficulties. They trek through the rainforest, avoiding snakes, insects, and even a type of fly that lays its eggs in their ears and nose.

Despite these challenges, the demand for chicle has decreased, and manufacturers have turned to synthetic alternatives to reduce costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are coming up with new and creative ways to market their products, claiming that gum can help with relaxation, energy, and even reduce tooth decay.

Research is also ongoing to develop new textures and flavors. Some flavors still use natural ingredients, while others are artificial. Interestingly, the United States has dedicated over 137 square kilometers to growing mint, which is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world.

The Hotel Inspector, Sue Brown, visits hotels to judge their quality. Christopher Middleton accompanied her on an inspection at the Globe Hotel. From the start, things went wrong. The receptionist was too busy talking on the phone to notice the guests, which is a common mistake. Sue Brown was not impressed. The hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the best hotels in the country. However, the entrance to the hotel was not what Sue expected. There was no one to greet them, and they had to use a buzzer to get in.

When they arrived at the reception, the staff couldn't find their booking. It turned out that many rooms were empty that night. Sue was not happy with the room she was shown, as it was stuffy and had a big hole in the wall. When she started her job, she was known for being tough, but she says she's not really tough. The next morning, she told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, about her findings. He apologized for the unpleasant smell in the main lounge and promised to fix it.

Sue also suggested that the staff should be more careful when showing guests to their rooms. She praised two staff members, Emma and Trudy, for their good work. The hotel's food was also good, so it kept its two-rosette rating. Sue gave the hotel some advice on how to improve, including serving better desserts. It's Sue's job to tell hotels what they need to improve, even if it's hard. She has to write a report and give the hotel a verbal warning. The hotel has to pay for this service, but it's worth it because it helps them improve. The hotel manager was relieved that Sue wouldn't recommend taking away their red stars, but he knew another inspector would be coming soon to make sure they had fixed the problems.<|eot_id|>"

My journey to climb the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent, began later in life. I'll share my experiences in the order I completed them.

A. Mount Everest, Asia (8,848m)
As we climbed, my partner, Dougal Haston, and I found ourselves in a snow cave 91m below the summit. I thought it was strange that only the two of us were there, and I started talking to my feet! The cold was getting into my toes, and I worried about frostbite. Over the next two days, I relived our time on the summit ridge. I realized that I couldn't have asked for a better climbing partner than Dougal. He inspired confidence in me, and I felt calm, knowing that everything would work out.

B. Mount McKinley, North America (6,194m)
In April 1976, Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days hauling equipment and food to the base. We decided to climb 'alpine style', carrying our gear and food with us. We followed a new route, which was challenging, and spent the third night on a windswept ridge. The air pressure in the polar regions is lower than expected, making it feel like we were at a higher altitude. We finally reached the summit and were relieved to be done.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)
In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with plans to climb Mt. Kenya. We ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. We got lost in the dense jungle and had to find a rock pool for water. We attempted a direct start up the breach wall but retreated due to falling rock and ice. We took the Umbwe route to the surrealistic summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
In January 1992, I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu. We joined a guide and a party going up the Polish Glacier, away from the busy standard route. We had to wait out bad weather for three days before starting our climb. We decided to miss the glacier and take the standard route instead. The wind was strong, but we reached the summit and camped outside the refuge.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
In 1992, I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was a matter of guiding people to finance the trip. This made the Seven Summits a reality. Our team traveled to the South Pole, where the sun was always above the horizon. We left camp and headed to the summit, facing strong winds and temperatures below -50°C. We reached the top within 8 hours, but visibility was limited due to the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)
In 1994, our team assembled in St Petersburg and traveled to the settlement of Terskol. We took a cableway to 3,900m and then walked to the refuge at 4,200m. The wind was strong, and we had to cross open slopes and glassy ice. We reached the summit, but found another kilometer-long ridge to the actual summit. We returned to the refuge and descended the next day.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)
In 1994, we climbed Carstensz Pyramid, hoping to establish a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. We were warned about potential dangers, but we proceeded, reaching the summit by 11 am. I received a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit, marking the completion of my Seven Summits journey.<|eot_id|>"

Fashion designers and stylists play a significant role in shaping our daily lives, from clothing to interior design and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest fashion trends with us. 

Ned Ingham is a renowned wedding dress designer who creates romantic and dreamy gowns. He suggests that people should avoid traditional, stiff dresses and opt for simpler styles instead. Ingham started drawing and designing wedding dresses as a schoolboy and later attended fashion school to hone his skills. His designs are not limited to wedding dresses; he also creates elegant evening dresses with modern twists. For those who prefer classic styles, Ingham offers timeless designs, such as a navy-blue suit that looks as fresh as ever.

Sally Quail is a jeweller who never received formal training in the field. She started designing her own engagement ring after being unable to find one she liked. Her unique style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has begun using diamonds in her creations, saying it's a reflection of her age.

Lily Grimson is a handbag designer who has gained recognition in the competitive fashion industry despite having only an introductory course in art and design. Her handmade bags are made in the UK and are known for their glamour, whether made from calfskin or silk. Grimson's designs are not just functional; they are also a statement piece.

Peter Little is a hairdresser who has styled the hair of many celebrities over the past 20 years. He believes that most women want a natural, easy-to-maintain hairstyle. His approach is to ensure that his clients never look like they just stepped out of a salon. This attention to detail comes at a price, with appointments starting at £250 and a three-month waiting list.

Penny Pratt is a florist who has no formal training in the field. She runs her own shop and provides floral arrangements for supermarkets and restaurants. Her simple yet modern designs have earned her numerous awards, allowing her to set up her own London Flower School. She emphasizes the importance of simplicity in flower arrangements, suggesting that fewer, stronger flowers are more effective than many leaves. For wedding bouquets, she advises using flowers of the same species.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

The Merrion Hotel is a five-star hotel in Dublin that has just opened. It was created by combining four old houses and installing the latest technology. The hotel's staff use a computer system to remember guests' preferences, so they can offer personalized service. For example, if a guest likes a certain type of music, the system will remember it and play it for them on their next visit.

The hotel also has a special system that allows guests to control the room temperature to their liking. They can choose a temperature between 14°C and 25°C, and each room can be adjusted individually.

The hotel has 145 comfortable and welcoming rooms, each with three phones, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has also laid extra cables to prepare for future technological advancements.

Despite all the technology, the hotel has made sure that guests don't feel overwhelmed. The rooms are designed to be comfortable and welcoming, and there are many other amenities, such as a swimming pool, gym, and two restaurants.

The hotel's restaurant, run by a two-Michelin-starred chef, offers excellent food and has many benefits, including better parking facilities. The hotel's staff are highly capable and aided by technology, making it likely to be a successful hotel.

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her beautiful flower paintings. Her garden, which surrounds her house, is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants spread out and self-seed, creating a colorful and harmonious arrangement along the two long flower borders that line the path. This harmony is partly due to the previous owners, who were keen gardeners and left many plants that Susan likes. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan focuses on painting individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She might occasionally paint a group of flowers together. When she paints, she takes one flower at a time, studying it carefully and then bringing in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes her a few days or even years to finish a piece.

Spring and early summer are her busiest times, when the tulips and poppies bloom. She loves watching the flowers change and develop over time. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they open up and change shape, revealing new and interesting forms.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany at school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside. She wasn't interested in garden flowers at first, but now she appreciates the beauty of plants from all over the world, which she has introduced to her garden. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, letting her children (or her plants) run free, as long as they don't cause any damage.

With two upcoming exhibitions, Susan has been busy preparing, but she knows that to stay connected to her subject matter, she needs to get her hands dirty. She has recently hired an extra gardener to help her with the workload.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 level learner:

Many trees in the Brackham area were knocked down by the strong storms in March. The town's central square lost two large lime trees, which changed the town's appearance. The town's residents were upset, especially Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who was usually very particular about the town's appearance. However, he was too ill to notice at the time. He had been suffering from bronchitis, a serious respiratory infection, and was bedridden.

Pelham's wife, Molly, had tried to persuade him to see a doctor, but he ignored her advice and continued working. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor's office. The doctor prescribed antibiotics, and Pelham's condition improved over the next few days.

When Pelham finally got out of bed, he was shocked to see that the walnut tree in his garden had been knocked down. He had not noticed it before because he was too ill. The tree had provided shade and a beautiful view from his living room. Now, the room seemed brighter and the worn furniture was more noticeable. The view from the window was also changed, as the house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, was now visible. The house was not very attractive, with its purple bricks and exposed pipes.

Pelham was unhappy with the new view and told his wife so. However, Molly was more positive and suggested that they buy a new sofa to improve the room's appearance.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

We had lived in our valley for 16 months when we realized the dangers that could threaten our survival. The year was unusual, with early storms and heavy snowfall before November. We had felt safe and sheltered in our valley, protected by the surrounding hills. However, the snow was deeper on the nearby hills and stayed there for longer. The wind was strong, and we could feel the gusts, but the trees were still stable.

Although the snow and wind were inconvenient, they didn't cause us much trouble. Our main concern was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed gently. We remembered that if the dams hadn't been built, the river could have caused problems. The snow started to melt, and we watched as the clouds grew thicker and darker, warning us of what was to come. The river began to rise, and we worried about the dam, which was almost at its maximum capacity.

Finally, the dam overflowed, and the water poured down the stream, making it much deeper than usual. We were relieved when the water level dropped, and the dam held. We had seen similar floods in the past, but now the dam prevents the river from overflowing and causing damage. We can enjoy the powerful river and the clouds that bring rain, knowing that our home is safe and secure.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

1. Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary to make it easier to understand.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

As a film critic for The Front Page, I look back on the last ten years of my work. Writing for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I did some reviewing for other newspapers, magazines, and radio. I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but Tom wasn't a journalist by profession. Initially, his idea was to have a team of critics cover various art forms, including books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would meet weekly to discuss our assignments, and there would be guests to make the atmosphere more social. It was a dream come true to be part of a new newspaper. However, the team concept didn't work out as planned. We ended up working individually, mostly by phone. The public preferred to associate a reviewer with a specific area, so I focused on film. Without Tom's initial push, I wouldn't have developed my current approach, which involves writing an extended review of one film each week. I prefer this arrangement, as it allows me to explore my ideas more deeply. I wouldn't be interested in reviewing every film that comes out, as that would become too routine. Instead, I can make the most of my space to develop my arguments, even on less exciting weeks. So, what is my role in the public sphere? I assume people choose which films to see based on the stars, publicity, or director. Loyalty to a particular genre or type of film can also play a role. It's rare for someone who dislikes westerns to attend one after reading a review, or for a romantic film fan to avoid a love story because of a negative review. So, if a film review isn't a consumer guide, what is its purpose? I don't feel responsible for being ""right"" about a movie, nor do I think there should be a certain number of ""great"" and ""bad"" films each year. My task is to present a well-reasoned argument. I'm not a judge, and I wouldn't want to be.<|eot_id|>"

Melanie, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, is an endurance athlete who loves triathlons. She has been training since she was 14 and has already achieved some impressive results. In a triathlon, athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. Melanie finds it fun and rewarding.

She entered her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, but then she realized it was much harder than she thought. She has faced many challenges, including getting lost during a race and having to run 20km more than expected. Despite these setbacks, Melanie has never given up and is determined to continue training.

Melanie's coach, Steve Trew, is impressed with her dedication and fitness level. She has been working hard to improve her cycling skills and is now one of the top junior triathletes in Europe. She hopes to compete in the World Championships in New Zealand and is trying to convince her parents to buy her a new bike to help her train.

However, Melanie's intense training schedule has made it difficult for her to have a social life. She spends most of her free time training and communicating with her teammates through phone calls and emails. She is focused on her goals and wants to continue pushing herself to achieve more.

Melanie is considering entering even tougher events than triathlons and is looking for a training partner who shares her passion for endurance sports. She is determined to succeed and is willing to make sacrifices to achieve her goals.

I'm Amanda Roy, and I love collecting things. Many people share this passion, and one in three adults collects something. Collecting is a world of passion, excitement, and joy. However, remember that if you don't fall in love with an object, don't collect it.

People have been collecting things for centuries. In the past, people collected pebbles and seashells because of their beauty. Today, children still collect stones and shells for the same reason. I've been collecting things my whole life. I've collected flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was of stones I found in my parents' garden.

I was lucky to go to a school in a remote part of England, where I would visit a local museum with my parents. I was fascinated by the objects on display. Many people collect things, and the reasons why are interesting. Some people collect because it's the only part of their life where they have complete control. For me, collecting is just something I enjoy.

There are many famous collectors throughout history. The Duc de Berry in France had a collection of natural and artificial curiosities. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. However, you don't have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I've collected things like tulip bulbs and china cups, searching for unique examples with great enthusiasm.

I once collected American rag dolls, 350 of them. I searched all over the USA for these dolls, and it was exciting to find each new variation. Unfortunately, my collection was destroyed in a house fire. It was sad to see my collection go, but it's the way collections change hands that fascinates me. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet can give value to an object. As certain objects become popular, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now valuable if you still have the original boxes. (Unfortunately, I threw away mine, along with the contents.)

We always spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim, Ireland. The four of us - Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I (Dorothy Milson, but everyone calls me Milly) - have been going on holidays together for a long time. We found Glencorn Lodge through an advertisement in a newspaper. We had a bad experience at a hotel the previous summer because the food was terrible. We've been playing cards together since we were young, and we've been going to Glencorn Lodge every year since then.

When we arrived, Mrs. Malseed, the owner, was already waiting for us in the large hall, which always smells of flowers. She has a knack for knowing when guests are about to arrive. She showed us to our rooms, which are named after flowers. In the winter, when it's quiet, she takes care of the little details, like painting flower names on the doors. Her husband, Mr. Malseed, is in charge of redecorating and repairs.

We were warmly welcomed by Mr. Malseed, who said, ""A hundred thousand welcomes!"" in the Irish way. He has a warm smile and twinkling eyes, making us feel like more than just hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and we knew our holiday had begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn Lodge; everything was as we had expected.

After dinner, we played cards for a bit, but not for too long because we were still tired from the journey. There were other people in the lounge, including a man on his own and a French couple. In the morning, we would usually take a walk along the beach, have coffee in the nearby village, and then come back for lunch. In the afternoon, we would go on a drive. This is our usual routine, which we've developed over the years.

Despite her youthful appearance, Rita claimed to be six years older than Marie and was studying at the University of Pennsylvania for her Master's degree. Seymour occasionally allowed students to visit his factory, and Rita was one of them. She was interested in the leather industry and asked detailed questions about the production process.

Seymour remembered a group of children from Marie's class visiting the factory years ago.

Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change? Many people find that talking to a careers advisor helps. You'll be asked to write a brief autobiography and take a series of tests called ""psychometrics"". The results will give you a summary and suggest new career paths, along with any necessary retraining.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organization that offers career guidance. The test was like a school exam, but it wasn't about passing or failing. The questions were designed to help the advisor understand me better. I was surprised to find that I didn't do well in the scientific, technical, and practical sections, but I was relieved to learn that I had made the right decision in pursuing journalism.

Changing your career doesn't always mean making a drastic change. Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years and turned to Career Analysts for help. She was surprised to discover she had a talent for design, but ultimately decided to use her existing skills to move into public relations.

Career guidance can be helpful for people who are unsure about their career direction. Juliet Greene, 26, visited Career Counselling Services and took the tests, which showed her interest in sciences. After four sessions with an advisor, she decided to pursue a degree in geology.

However, career advice may not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, was unhappy with her sales job and thought a careers advisor might suggest something new.

Visiting the Dentist: A New Experience

W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in Glasgow's city centre is a pleasant surprise. The modern paintings on the walls and the blue couch create a welcoming atmosphere. Jerome wants to make his patients feel comfortable, so he doesn't wear a traditional white coat. He believes that dental treatment should be a relaxing and enjoyable experience, not a painful one.

Many people avoid going to the dentist unless they have a problem. Jerome thinks this is because they are scared. To make his patients feel more at ease, he has introduced some innovative techniques. For example, he uses virtual-reality headsets during check-ups. Patients watch a film about underwater wildlife while he examines their teeth. This makes the experience more enjoyable and helps them forget any previous negative experiences.

The surgery also has a pleasant smell, similar to a perfume shop. Jerome wants his patients to feel relaxed and not associate the dentist with unpleasant smells. He is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, but he emphasizes that his focus is on providing high-quality treatment. He uses specialized instruments to clean teeth, making the process more comfortable for his patients.

Jerome believes that by making patients feel more relaxed, he can make his job easier too. He has learned from his research in the United States that patient-centered care is key to a successful dental practice. His approach is a new trend in British dentistry, which is moving away from traditional formalities.

As I observe Jerome's practice, a patient arrives and is offered a cup of tea and a choice of videos to watch. The patient seems to be enjoying the experience, and it's easy to see why. The surgery feels like a luxurious beauty parlour, not a typical dental practice.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Chocolate is a big business today, with people spending over £230 million on it in the UK at Easter. This is 8% of all chocolate sold worldwide. Although chocolate is now widely available, its origins date back over 3,000 years to the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilisations in Central America. The cacao tree, which is native to Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia, produces fruit with 20-40 seeds that can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, these seeds are often called cocoa beans, although this is a misspelling from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and to make a bitter drink called xocoatl. This drink was flavoured with spices and used on special occasions. The Spanish found it more palatable with cinnamon and sugar, but it didn't become popular in Europe until the 17th century. Chocolate houses were set up in European cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

In the 19th century, chocolate powder was invented, making it easier to make chocolate at home. The chocolate bar as we know it today was first produced in 1847 by a British company. Milk chocolate was introduced later, and the British market was dominated by French companies until Cadbury introduced its famous Dairy Milk bar in 1905. Today, chocolate intake in the UK has stabilised, and manufacturers are looking for new ways to attract customers. Some are now offering chocolate in different forms, such as ice cream or soft drinks.

At the same time, cacao farmers are still feeling the effects of a crash in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers were forced out of business. As you enjoy your next chocolate bar, spare a thought for these farmers who work hard to produce the chocolate we love.

Peter Cooke, 83 years old, is a master of creating beautiful objects from shells. He has been doing this for the past ten years and has become very skilled. Although he still wants to try new things, like making paper and feather crafts, he is happy to continue perfecting his shell art.

As he shows me around his apartment, filled with his creations, he asks if I'm getting bored. But his enthusiasm is infectious, and his work is truly stunning. He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above the fireplace and says, ""I don't care if people don't buy them, because they're adorable to me."" He never intended to sell his work commercially, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition in London, where 70% of the pieces sold.

His latest exhibition has just opened, with prices ranging from £225 to £2,000. Peter is happy to let the gallery owner set the prices, as he believes his work is unique and will become more valuable in the future. Despite his physical limitations, Peter continues to create beautiful pieces, including intricate boxes, pictures, and flowers.

Peter's attention to detail and color gradations are remarkable, and he achieves this through his own method, using materials he finds and collects. He has traveled to many beaches around the world to find the perfect shells, ensuring that he only collects dead shells and does not harm the environment.

Peter's argument that he is not harming the environment is convincing, as he only collects shells that have been left behind and does not disturb living creatures. His beautiful work is a testament to his dedication and skill, and he is proud to share it with others.

Kira Langer, a 15-year-old schoolgirl, is not only a model but also a student. When she's not traveling to exotic locations and appearing on magazine covers, she's busy studying for her exams. I met Kira at the agency where she works, and I was surprised to find her friendly, relaxed, and apologetic. She was accompanied by her mother, who was proud of her daughter's success.

Kira won the Looks magazine supermodel competition, which was a surprise to her. Her older sister had entered her into the competition without her knowledge, and Kira was initially hesitant. However, she decided to participate and ended up winning easily.

As a model, Kira has to manage her two lives - school and her career. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are rude and jealous of her success. Kira says that people assume that because she's a model, she must have changed and become self-important. However, she assures that she's still the same person and has simply become more confident.

As a busy model, Kira's social life is affected. She can't make plans with her friends because she never knows what her schedule will be like the next day. However, her friends are understanding and don't hold it against her.

Kira has the potential for a successful career in modeling, and she's grateful for the opportunities she's had. When I asked her what she would like to do if she weren't a model, she replied that she would like to be a journalist, just like me.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Terence and Chris Madden, a father-son team, have traveled from Canada to Wales in search of gold. They believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After 10 years of digging, they are close to finding a vein of gold worth millions of dollars.

""We're finding high levels of gold as we dig,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. ""We just need to get a few more meters to where it's concentrated."" The pair have dedicated their lives to searching for gold. They started their search after Terence read about pockets of gold in the Dolgellau gold belt, an area around the Welsh town of Dolgellau.

The father and son team have spent the past 10 years clearing the land, taking samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They have dug out 150 tons of rock to form a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they need £50,000 to lower the mine a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says they are not sure if they will find a backer.

The news of the dig has attracted attention from locals and tourists. The town of Dolgellau relies on tourism, and residents are cautiously hopeful. ""It would be great for the town if they find gold,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel. ""But we don't want people to start digging randomly.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since its peak in the late 1880s, when many mines operated in the area. One of the last remaining mines closed recently. However, individual gold-diggers are returning to the area, hoping to strike it rich. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge. ""Searching for gold is emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's exciting and adventurous, the thrill of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time.""<|eot_id|>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends most of her time studying the ocean. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. Rachel's job involves teaching and researching marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea.

When she's not teaching, Rachel goes on underwater adventures. She uses a special vehicle that's like a small car, and it takes her three kilometers down to the ocean floor. The space inside is very small, so she can almost touch the two pilots who accompany her. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside.

A dive can take up to 16 hours. The first three hours are spent going down to the ocean floor, then they collect samples of rock and water for ten hours, and finally, they head back up to the surface in three hours. If anything goes wrong, Rachel can hit a panic button, and a small escape vessel will be released, which will quickly take her to the surface.

Rachel has made six dives so far. Last year, she went on a dive with a Russian team to a site near the Canary Islands. They explored an area with many underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This ""black smoke"" is actually hot water that pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

Rachel has also been on a dive with an American team. During that dive, there was an explosion, and Rachel thought she was going to die. But luckily, they were okay, and they were relieved to be alive.

Rachel loves her job because it's an adventure. Every time she looks out of the window of her underwater vehicle and sees the volcanoes, she feels a sense of wonder. She's one of the few people who have ever seen these underwater wonders, and it's an incredible feeling.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

I was exhausted, dirty, and hungry after my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind were tired of the constant travel, foreign timetables, currencies, and languages. I thought, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home soil. But I said the same thing the next year, and the year after. As a young adult, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month with just one train ticket.

Traveling by train has its own rhythm, and you learn to sleep anywhere, even in a train corridor. Carrying all your belongings in a backpack makes you appreciate the basics and encourages you to be more careless with your things. This carefree attitude is what Inter-Rail is all about. The ticket gives you the freedom to travel to multiple countries in a short time, which is quite special.

On my first trip, my friends and I didn't realize the full potential of the ticket and thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we soon discovered that we could travel to other countries without extra cost. We weren't interested in culture, but we were excited to be on our own, without parents, and to make our own plans. We focused on the most easily accessible sights and enjoyed the freedom to do what we wanted.

The excitement of travel comes from experiencing a new place for the first time. Seeing a city or town with your own eyes is a unique experience. You can't truly understand Europe until you see it for yourself. That's why other people's holiday photos can be boring - they don't capture the real experience. The train trip may not teach you anything new, but it's a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives you the opportunity to explore it, even if it takes time to realize it.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

Losing your luggage when traveling can be frustrating. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your bag. This can be especially problematic if you're traveling to a different climate or far from home. Although airlines don't usually reveal how often they lose luggage, it's a common issue for frequent travelers. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it's impossible to guarantee that your luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have a layover.

Airports have a system to handle luggage. Airlines require passengers to check in early to allow time for baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. They also have minimum connecting times, which are the shortest time it takes to transfer between flights. However, delays and security checks can cause problems, and human error or accidents can also occur. Large airports, known as hubs, can be particularly prone to issues due to the high volume of luggage.

It's a good idea to choose direct flights whenever possible and check in early. If you need to change planes, try to fly with the same airline and allow extra time for connections. Make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, and include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, report the issue to the airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report before leaving the airport.

Note: I made some minor changes to the original text to make it more accessible to a C1 level learner, including:

* Simplifying sentence structures and vocabulary
* Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones

Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who specializes in taking pictures of kingfishers. These birds are known for their bright blue-green feathers and are often found near streams and rivers, where they feed on fish. The kingfisher's habitat is characterized by old trees that partially shade the water, creating a peaceful atmosphere with soft colors like green, brown, and yellow. When the kingfisher flies, it moves quickly and precisely, leaving a lasting impression on the observer.

Charlie James has been fascinated by kingfishers since he was young. He can't quite explain why, but he feels a deep connection to these birds. In fact, he loves them so much that he has dedicated his career to photographing them. Kingfishers have a special place in many cultures, including Greek mythology, where they are associated with the moon and the sun.

Interestingly, kingfishers don't actually have blue feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are structured allows them to reflect blue light, giving them their distinctive color. This is why they can appear to change color depending on the angle of the light.

As a wildlife photographer, Charlie James has spent many hours waiting patiently for kingfishers to appear. He has even built his own hideouts, such as an old blanket, to get up close and personal with the birds. It took him four years to get his first good picture, but it was worth it. Today, Charlie James is a renowned wildlife photographer, and he continues to pursue his passion for kingfishers.

In the future, Charlie would like to make a film about kingfishers that features beautiful, wordless images. He is drawn to the simple, yet powerful, way that kingfishers communicate through their colors and movements. Despite his success as a photographer, Charlie knows that there is still much more to his relationship with kingfishers that he can express through his work.<|eot_id|>"

Conducting an orchestra is a challenging job. Five conductors share their experiences with Anne Inglis. A. ANNE MANSON

Anne Manson, 30, was asked to help conductor Claudio Abbado during a rehearsal. She then assisted him on another opera production. Manson works with a well-known opera company in London, focusing on modern works. She has also worked in other European countries with the help of the British Arts Council. B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE

Andrew Constantine, 31, won a major competition in 1991. He is grateful for the opportunity, as it provided many performance chances and a period as assistant to a well-known conductor. However, he struggles to shake off the ""competition"" label. Orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired him after the competition, now invite him back. C. WASFI KANI

Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal period that comes with opera productions. She believes the music is worth the time and effort. Kani started conducting in her late 20s and credits her mentor, Sian Edwards, for helping her develop her skills. She likes the complexity of opera, which involves dealing with different personalities and arguments. D. ROGER VIGNOLES

Roger Vignoles, 48, never expected to become a conductor but found it fascinating. He started his career as a musician and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, which was less difficult than he thought. He is grateful for his experience and is willing to take on new challenges to find what he enjoys. E. WAYNE MARSHALL

Wayne Marshall, 32, was noticed by conductor Simon Rattle in 1986 and soon found himself conducting a musical in London. He had to deal with some professional musicians who were not taking the performance seriously. Marshall believes in being clear and direct with the musicians and has never been afraid to express his opinions. He has learned that being determined and knowing what you want is key to success.

If you're thinking of taking your children to a theme park in the UK, there are many options to choose from. We asked five families to test out the best ones. 

The Burns family visited Fun Island, and they were pleasantly surprised. The park has many rides suitable for young children, so their three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special dodgems ride for the very young. For older children, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! The staff were helpful, and the park was clean and well-organised.

The McMillan family visited Wonderland, and none of them had been to a theme park before. They thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which had small replicas of famous buildings at his level. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a proper road layout. The park was well-designed, with places to rest and friendly staff.

The Jeffree family visited Adventure World and spent seven hours there. The children loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line, although the girls were a bit scared. They also enjoyed Running River, where you think you'll get soaked but don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The park was well-designed, with minimal queuing and spotless facilities.

The Langridge family visited The Great Park, which is suitable for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. They all enjoyed Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and becomes fun. They also liked Lightning River, but the Big Leap was too intense for them. The park is open until 5 pm, which was a bit disappointing.

The Break-all family visited Fantasy World, which promises ""No Limit to the Fun"". They found Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, and the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres above the ground, to be the most thrilling rides. The older children went on the main rides several times, while Sarah enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were mixed, but overall, the park was fun and had plenty to offer.

Running a business in the countryside

Five women share their experiences of setting up a business in the countryside. They all chose to leave the city for a better work-life balance and more freedom.

Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business from her home. She moved to the countryside with her family and started her business because she wanted to work from home. She has been careful with her finances and has built a successful business with four employees. She enjoys the flexibility of working from home and being able to work in the evenings if she wants.

Maggy Sasanow is a designer who works from home, creating greetings cards. She trained in art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there wasn't much work available in the countryside. So, she started her own business, selling her cards to museums. She works in a large room in her house and doesn't advertise her business. Instead, she relies on word of mouth and has built a loyal customer base.

Delia Turner's curtain-making business has had its ups and downs. She started the business eight years ago and it grew quickly, but then the economy declined and she had to lay off her employees. She now works from home with the help of her husband and a few part-time workers. She has to be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances.

Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside for financial reasons and to be closer to nature. She works long hours, taking calls at odd times of the day, and has to discipline herself to stay focused. Her business is international, with clients in Australia, the Far East, and North America.

Meg Rivers started a cakes-by-post business from her home and then expanded to a shop. She is passionate about healthy eating and makes high-quality cakes using good ingredients. She has built a team of six employees and has a turnover of £250,000 per year. Her biggest challenge has been managing the financial side of the business.

Meet the Watkins Family: A Family of Musicians

The Watkins family is a unique one. The two sons, Paul and Huw, are both talented musicians, while their father, John, makes musical instruments. It's not common to find a family with such a mix of musical talents.

When Paul was 10 years old, he started playing the cello. His parents, John and Hetty, noticed that buying a cello would be expensive, so John decided to learn how to make one himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for three years and made Paul's first cello. Paul still uses the same cello today.

John has since become a full-time instrument maker and makes up to 12 violins a year. He even sold one to a famous American musician, which was a great achievement.

Both Paul and Huw started playing music at a young age. Paul began with the piano, and then switched to the cello. His father, John, played the viola and encouraged Paul to take up the violin, but Paul preferred the cello. Huw, on the other hand, started with the piano and later discovered his own passion for the cello.

The family is very supportive of each other's musical endeavors. Paul has won several awards, including the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. He was also appointed principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the age of 20. Huw is now a pianist and composer, and his string quartet is set to be performed at the Wigmore Hall.

The family is proud of each other's achievements, and John is happy to see his sons pursuing their musical passions. However, it can be challenging for John and Hetty to keep track of their sons' busy schedules, with Paul performing at the Cheltenham Festival and Huw's string quartet receiving its London premiere on the same night.

The National Trust is a charity that works to protect the British countryside. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and met Gareth Roberts, a warden who looks after the beautiful areas owned by the Trust. To be a National Trust warden, you need common sense and good communication skills, as you deal with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders.

Gareth was born and raised on the Lleyn Peninsula and used to work on his family's farm. He applied for the warden job and was chosen because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. His farming background helps him understand the problems of local farmers and deal with them effectively.

As a warden, Gareth's main tasks include conservation, managing public access to the Trust's land, planting trees, and maintaining buildings. He also meets with the Trust's tenant farmers to ensure that jobs are done efficiently and economically. What he enjoys most is seeing projects completed, although he spends about half his time on paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, but sometimes finds it frustrating dealing with some visitors who demand a lot without showing respect for the land and its owners. However, he believes that with common sense, anyone can be a good warden. If you like the outdoors and are willing to work hard, you might consider applying for this role - but be prepared to wait for a job to become available, as the Lleyn Peninsula is a popular area.

I asked Kendra if she gets strange looks while training in public. She replied that she is too focused on her movements and footwork to notice. Her whole life is centered around preparing for the World Championships. She is determined to perform at her best.

This is Kendra's fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 teams participating. She is excited to have the support of a home crowd, which will add to the pressure. As captain, Kendra wants to make sure the team starts the tournament strongly.

Their first game is against Barbados, a team they have beaten before but expects to be a tough opponent. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows that the World Championships will be challenging. There is no rest between games, and every match is crucial.

Kendra has been playing at the top level for 15 years, and the sport has become faster and more competitive. She believes that players must be physically and mentally prepared to succeed. As captain, Kendra focuses on supporting and encouraging her teammates.

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully, and this will be her last big event as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on the World Championships.

SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS: HELPING CHILDREN WITH EXCEPTIONAL MUSICAL TALENT

Some children show exceptional musical ability, but it can be difficult for parents to know how to help them develop their talent. Many parents may not recognize their child's need until they start to show signs of frustration. This can lead to behavior problems. Schools that focus on academic subjects may not be the best place for musically gifted children, as they may not have the resources or expertise to support their development.

Specialist music schools in Britain offer a supportive environment where children aged 7-18 can develop their musical skills with the guidance of professional musicians. These schools provide a unique environment where children can spend a significant amount of time practicing music, receiving individual lessons, and participating in orchestras, chamber groups, and theory classes. They also have private practice rooms and a limited academic program that focuses on essential subjects like English, math, science, and languages.

The schools are independent and have a high teacher-to-student ratio, with small class sizes. Most students are boarders, living at the school full-time. This allows them to focus on their music and be surrounded by like-minded peers.

However, there are some disadvantages. The schools are expensive, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year for boarders. Additionally, some parents may not want to send their children to boarding school at a young age. The directors of the schools express concerns about admitting children as young as 7 to such an intense environment.

While setting musically gifted children apart from their peers can cause stress, the schools monitor individual progress and offer support when needed. Some former students feel that they benefited from the high-quality music education, but others feel that the limited academic program was a drawback.

For some musically gifted children, it may be better to wait until they are older before considering a specialist education. They may do well in a school with a strong music program or by combining their music training with a normal school routine. However, this option may not be suitable for families living outside of major cities.<|eot_id|>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings, and her garden is her main source of inspiration. The garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wild and spread throughout the garden, creating a beautiful harmony of colors, shapes, and structures. The garden's beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind many plants that Susan loves. She also inherited the gardener, Danny, who has been a great help.

Susan focuses on painting individual flowers rather than the garden as a whole. She often takes a single flower from the garden, paints it, and then adds more flowers to the painting over time. It can take her several years to complete a painting. Her busiest time is in the spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom.

Susan has always been interested in plants and used to collect wildflowers as a child. She loves how they can grow in unexpected places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops. Her garden now features plants from all over the world, but she treats them like they're part of her own family. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, letting her children (her paintings) play and grow without too much interference.

With two upcoming exhibitions and a constant supply of inspiration at her doorstep, Susan has been busy lately. She now employs an extra gardener to help her, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, she needs to get her hands dirty and work in the garden herself.<|eot_id|>"

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, has been working as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France, for the second year. She works for a company that provides accommodation and meals for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden chalets. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She enjoys her job as a chalet girl, as it allows her to meet new people and make contacts.

Sarah's day starts at 7 am, when she walks to the chalet, which can accommodate up to 18 guests. She has breakfast and then prepares breakfast for the guests, who enjoy a variety of options such as porridge, eggs, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She usually goes skiing in the afternoon and returns to the chalet in the evening to prepare dinner.

Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 pm, and Sarah clears away the dishes afterwards. She often stays and chats with the guests, but sometimes they prefer to be left alone. On Sundays, Sarah's day is busier than usual, as she has to prepare breakfast for the guests and then clean the chalet thoroughly before the new guests arrive. She may also do some shopping and take guests to the ski shop to rent equipment.

In the evening, Sarah meets her friends and they go out for a few drinks and dinner. However, she usually doesn't stay out too late, as she has to be bright and early the next day to start her duties again.<|eot_id|>"

Mandie Currie, a zookeeper, spent a day at Marie Claire magazine's offices. She usually wears a uniform at work, but this day was different. She went to a photo studio, then to a press preview, before lunch. The zoo is a peaceful place, but at Marie Claire, everyone seemed stressed. Mandie was surprised to see how much work goes into making a magazine. She enjoys her job at the zoo and wouldn't want to change.

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo. She wore her usual boots and trousers, but the zoo gave her a green shirt to wear. She got dirty while working with the animals. She enjoyed her day, but was glad to go home and shower. Alice thought about working with elephants in Africa after she retires.

Karen Hodson, a nurse, went on location with the TV show Ground Force. She was excited to meet the team and presenter Alan Titchmarsh. She enjoyed being outdoors and working with the team. However, she realized that landscape gardening is harder work than she thought. She's happy to stick to her job as a nurse.

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener, worked at Hammersmith Hospital. He expected to feel overwhelmed, but he surprised himself by handling the tasks easily. He enjoyed the friendly atmosphere among the nurses and felt like he was in a more feminine environment. He realized that his job as a gardener is not as important as his work as a nurse.

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with Ryanair as a cabin crew member. She felt more confident when she put on the uniform. She had to give out magazines to passengers and deal with a rowdy group of schoolchildren on the return journey. She enjoyed her day, but was happy to go back to her job as a personal trainer.

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess, spent the day as a personal trainer. She was nervous about exercising, but was surprised by how much attention she gave to one person. She realized that her job as an air hostess is more social than she thought, and it inspired her to join a gym and be healthier.

Are you trying to get your story published? If you're wondering where to send it, our expert Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many readers of this magazine ask us, ""I've written a story/book, can you tell me who to send it to?"" The first thing you need to know is that you should research the market and find out about publishers, as well as improve your writing skills. To succeed, you need to know the publishing industry. One way to do this is by reading widely and staying up-to-date with new publications. Visit your local library and bookstores to see what's popular and what publishers are looking for. You should also update your knowledge as new publications emerge and editors change jobs.

When you're starting out, you might not be sure what kind of writing you want to do. Let's say you're interested in writing short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories and get hold of some recent issues. Read the types of stories they publish and take note of their target audience. These readers will have different expectations, and editors only want to cater to their needs.

Many writers send me their work, saying, ""I've been rejected three times - am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone, but it's unlikely that the work is publishable. Most new writers send their work out too soon, before they're ready. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success stories often involve years of experience in the publishing industry.

When you finally send your work out, start writing more while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you'll start to see yourself as a writer. Don't be afraid to improve your work instead of giving up. I also advise not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Every successful writer has faced many rejections before succeeding. To advance your writing career, consider taking a creative writing course or joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and make writing a daily habit.<|eot_id|>"

On the last day of a difficult year, I was waiting for my train at Baltimore station. There were more people than I expected, and the usual feeling of cleanliness and brightness was gone. Elderly couples were sitting on the benches, and college students were scattered around with their bags. A well-dressed man was walking around, talking to strangers. He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia, and then came over to a girl with blonde hair who was standing near me. I had been thinking I might talk to her too. The man asked her if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to New York. He didn't ask me, and instead went to ask an old lady and then a couple with matching luggage. I was curious about him, so I watched him.

He seemed stressed and was asking people if they were going to Philadelphia. One woman told him she was going to Wilmington, and he didn't say anything. He then asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia, and she said yes. He asked her for a favour, but she seemed hesitant. I was about to leave, but the train announcement came on, and people started moving towards the gate. The man told the woman that his daughter was leaving for a study year abroad and had forgotten her passport. He had left her at the station and was looking for someone to bring her the passport. The woman was sympathetic, but I thought it was an unusual story. The man said his wife was in a wheelchair, which seemed like an excuse. I thought it was a suspicious story, especially because he was carrying a padded envelope that looked like it was stapled shut.

My son Gary is a famous TV chef. I, John Moore, am his father and the owner of a restaurant. I believe everyone deserves a chance in life. When I heard about the restaurant, I knew it was the perfect opportunity for me. It was in a bad state, but I saw potential. Running the restaurant reminded me of my childhood, when my mother worked in a factory and I was left alone. I wanted to make sure our family had time together. My wife took care of the children and did the accounting, while I focused on the business. We lived above the restaurant and made sure to have family meals together. This has had a positive impact on our children, Gary and Joe. They're both confident and have learned important skills from a young age.

Gary was a lively child who loved helping out. He started doing odd jobs and by the time he was ten, he was already working in the kitchen every weekend. He had a lot of discipline and would often wake up early to help out. I knew he had a talent for cooking and was destined for a career in the culinary industry. When he turned 15, he was already as skilled as some of the adult chefs, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He recently started playing the drums and has his own band. I've told him to focus on one thing at a time and not spread himself too thin.

Gary went to catering college at 17 and quickly stood out among his peers. He's now a successful TV chef, and I'm extremely proud of him. I've always told him that success requires hard work, and he's taken that advice to heart. I'm happy that he's listened to me and made the most of the opportunities he's been given.

Finding a good flat in Dublin at an affordable price was like finding a rare treasure. The best way to find one was through personal connections, but Jo had just moved to Dublin and didn't know anyone. She had to stay in a hostel and search for a place on her own. Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she arrived in Dublin. She didn't think about why she was moving there, it was just something she had always assumed she would do.

Jo's friends at school had all gone to bigger cities like Ennis or Limerick to work, but Jo was going to Dublin on her own. Her parents had different opinions about her living arrangements. Her mother thought it would be safe for her to stay in a hostel run by nuns, while her father worried that it might be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for so long.

Jo saw an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that seemed too good to be true. It had its own room, TV, and shared kitchen and bathroom. The location was close to her work, so she decided to apply. When she arrived at the flat, she met two girls, Nessa and Pauline, who were already living there. Nessa was a failed applicant who warned Jo about the flat, saying that the owners were ""awful"" and ""common"". Pauline, on the other hand, was a punk with bright hair and a colorful shirt.

People love dolphins, but unfortunately, their situation is very concerning. According to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, their numbers are declining. Dolphins are highly intelligent and sensitive to human emotions, which is why they have a special place in our hearts. We often see them in films, TV shows, and at seaside attractions, but these portrayals hide the reality of their lives in polluted and overfished oceans.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. Despite their popularity, dolphins are not well protected by law and are not given the care they need. There are 40 different types of dolphins worldwide, and in northern Europe, the most common ones are the striped, common, bottlenose, and harbour porpoise.

The striped and common dolphins live far out at sea and are rarely seen. The bottlenose and harbour porpoises, on the other hand, used to be common near European coastlines. However, their numbers have declined, and those that remain are showing signs of stress. It's difficult to determine the exact reasons for this decline, but overfishing, which is threatening the world's fish stocks, is a major factor.

Overfishing not only harms fish but also affects porpoises and dolphins, as they need to find food quickly and may not survive if fish are removed from their usual areas. They are also at risk of getting caught in fishermen's nets, which can be invisible to them. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on French and Cornish beaches, showing signs of having been caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also be affected by waste and pollutants in the sea, such as pesticides, which can build up in their bodies and be passed on to their young. In fact, there is already a recorded case of a young dolphin being poisoned by its mother's milk. Noise pollution from human activities like shipping and oil drilling is another threat to dolphins, as it can disturb them in ways we don't yet fully understand.

""Exercise is essential for our overall well-being. It's a great way to maintain a balance in our busy lives, where everything seems to be moving fast and getting more chaotic. There are many reasons why exercise is beneficial, and few reasons not to do it. Regular exercise can improve our physical appearance, boost our mood, and even help us sleep better. It can also reduce stress and alleviate certain medical conditions.

There are many types of exercise we can do, such as aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, and weightlifting. However, it's essential to start slowly and carefully to avoid injuries. It's also important to listen to your body and consult a doctor if you're unsure what's best for you.

Good posture is crucial for our overall well-being. It not only affects how we look but also how we feel. Practicing good posture can make us feel more energetic and reduce the risk of minor health complaints. To improve our posture, we can imagine a helium balloon attached to the top of our head, lifting us up and straightening our spine.

Stretching is also an important part of our exercise routine. It improves flexibility, makes movements easier, and helps prevent injuries. By incorporating stretching into our routine, we can maintain a more flexible and fitter body. The best exercise routine involves a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period.

Remember, exercise is not just about physical appearance; it's about feeling good, both physically and mentally. By incorporating exercise into our daily routine, we can improve our overall well-being and live a healthier, happier life.""<|eot_id|>"

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from home for months? The search for the perfect shot. Amanda and Owen are always on the lookout for the best footage of animals in the wild. They currently live in the Ngorongoro Crater in East Africa, where it has been raining non-stop for six months. This has caused some problems, like getting stuck in the mud. To solve this, they bought a special vehicle that can pull each other out if needed.

Amanda and Owen have worked together for a long time, creating many successful wildlife films. They are known for their film about leopards, which was very well-received. They often travel the world to film exotic animals, just like many other wildlife filmmakers.

I spoke to Owen while he was taking a break at a safari lodge. He said that they sometimes have disagreements, but they usually resolve them quickly. They don't see themselves as leaders, and this helps them work well together. They both have a similar way of understanding animals.

When they're on location, they set up their tents each night. Since they're staying in one place for a while, they make their tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask. They eat pre-prepared meals, which can be a challenge when they're away for up to eight weeks at a time.

Despite the challenges, Amanda and Owen love being in remote areas, where they can get close to the animals and become part of their lives. They remember one time when they filmed a family of lions and became friends with one of the lionesses, who would come to greet them as part of her daily routine.

Amanda and Owen have been working together since 1988 and have learned to plan four months of filming for each half-hour documentary. Before they start filming, they submit a script for approval. They aim to create films that are rich in atmosphere, evoke emotions, and bring the audience closer to the animals and their habitats.

Meet England's Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis spoke with England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is preparing for the World Championships next month. Her daily routine is intense, with a day of teaching followed by a training session in a local supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her unusual training venue. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else,' she said. 'I might notice cars slowing down, but that's all.'

Kendra's life is now all about making sure she's at her best for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to improve her fitness. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. 'We'll have home support behind us, which is amazing,' she said. 'And it's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. As a result, there will be more pressure than usual. A home crowd will have high expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.'

The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra emphasized that the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games. And you can still win an international series even if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready to make the most of it.'

Kendra has been playing at the top level for 15 years, and the sport has become faster and more competitive. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train hard not to win,' she said. 'But after the final whistle, we all become friends again.'

Netball is also taking a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'It's essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' Kendra said. As captain, she believes it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. 'I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.'

Kendra has always planned her netball career carefully. She has decided that this will be her last big competition as a player, but she will likely coach young players in the future. As she leads her team out onto the court for the opening ceremony, she will likely have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be behind her every step of the way.<|eot_id|>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which is the study of the chemical processes that happen in the sea. Rachel works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater expeditions in a special vehicle that's like a small car. She dives down to the ocean floor, which is three kilometers deep, to study underwater volcanoes.

The space inside the vehicle is very small, so she can almost touch the two pilots who are with her. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. The dive can take up to 16 hours, including three hours to get to the ocean floor, 10 hours to collect samples, and three hours to get back up to the surface.

If something goes wrong, Rachel can press a panic button, and an escape vessel will release and rise quickly to the surface. Rachel has made six dives so far, including one with a Russian team. They went to an area with many underwater volcanoes, where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The volcanoes are like chimneys, spewing out black smoke.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she's in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she does it so she can focus on her research into underwater volcanoes, also known as ""black smokers."" These volcanoes are special because hot water comes out of the rock and turns into black smoke. It's an incredible feeling to see them up close.

Rachel has had a few scary moments, like when there was an explosion during a dive with an American team. But she's also experienced the thrill of discovery, like when she saw the black smokers for the first time. She felt a sense of wonder and amazement, knowing that no one else on the planet had ever seen them before.<|eot_id|>"

First impressions are crucial in job interviews. Research shows that people form an opinion about us within a few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our body language, and how we speak. Mary Pearce, a teacher, learned this the hard way. She had a small hole in her jacket during an interview, but she didn't change because she was worried about being late. Unfortunately, the Head Teacher didn't offer her the job, saying that if someone doesn't present themselves well, they might not be a good teacher.

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, agrees that how we present ourselves matters. He believes that if someone takes the time to look good, they are more likely to care about their job. Many people, however, underestimate the importance of having a professional image. Janet Goodwood, an administrative assistant, was rejected for a promotion because she didn't fit the expected image. She was shocked and didn't understand why her appearance mattered.

Our non-verbal communication, such as facial expressions and body language, also plays a significant role in making a good impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 55% of our message comes from our facial expressions, 38% from our voice, and only 7% from our words. It's essential to ensure that our words and body language match. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

Additionally, it's crucial not to appear too desperate or too eager. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, learned this the hard way when she reacted too enthusiastically to a job offer. She was offered a lower salary than she had hoped for.

Finally, being prepared and informed about the company before an interview can make a big difference. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests researching the company and mentioning areas of interest during the interview. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, recommends having a few prepared questions and speaking in short, clear sentences. She emphasizes that good communicators speak in short sentences and use highlighted points.

I was particularly good at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial with a professional football club, but I decided to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country's youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't attract much media attention, which was disappointing. I train hard, both at home and abroad, to improve my skills. I have to be disciplined and say no to social invitations if they conflict with my training schedule. My goal is to qualify for the next Olympics. B Gabriel (surfer) As a surfer, I'm part of a small community, so I see the same competitors at events. Professional surfers are serious about their training and often prioritize early morning sessions. I have to give up late nights out and lie-ins, but it's worth it. Without dedication, I wouldn't have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I like to celebrate with a big night out, and if there's prize money involved, I'll treat myself to a nice trip. The sacrifices are worth it in the long run, as winning the championship led to a TV presenting opportunity. C Dieter (yacht racer) Sailing with a team of five friends is a great experience. We celebrate our wins with a big party. While we do enjoy ourselves, we don't actively seek media attention. Reporters often focus more on our social lives than our sailing achievements. I'm away from home for eight months a year, so it's nice to return and spend time with friends from other walks of life. I'm known in the sailing world, but I'm not a celebrity. I appreciate the nice letters I receive and make an effort to respond to each one. D Tomas (tennis player) It's exciting to walk onto the court with the crowd cheering. However, it can get overwhelming at times. I do enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out and about, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like the attention I received from female fans. As a tennis player, I have to travel frequently, which can be challenging. In the end, it was one of the reasons we broke up.

Shopping with children can be a challenging experience for many mothers. They often want everything they see, from the latest sugary cereals to Disney videos and comics. Parents feel guilty when they agree to their demands, knowing they may be buying unhealthy products. On the other hand, saying no can lead to conflict and frustration. Research shows that children make a purchase request every two minutes while shopping with their parents. The advertising industry spends over £150 million a year targeting children, mostly on TV. This can make it difficult for parents to explain their decisions about what they can and cannot afford.

Many parents worry about what they feed their children and have their own ideas about healthy food. However, these ideas may not always be accurate. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance suggests that parents and children should have a dialogue about food, as children may only get information from TV advertising. Parents feel pressured to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

Some parents find it stressful to decide which demands to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but still feels unhappy about managing their shopping requests. Another mother has taught her son to be critical of advertisements and they now have little conflict when shopping.

Parents also admit to being inconsistent in their responses to their children's requests. For example, they may refuse to buy sweets for their children, but then buy unhealthy treats for themselves. Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. This could attract more customers and make shopping a more enjoyable experience for everyone.

The Merrion Hotel, a five-star hotel in Dublin, has just opened its doors. It's the result of nearly two years of work converting four historic houses into a modern hotel. The hotel's General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know each guest by name. To make this possible, the hotel uses a computer system that stores information about each guest's preferences. This system cost £250,000 to install, but it will pay for itself in the long run, according to MacCann.

The hotel's technology also allows guests to control the room temperature to their liking. They can adjust it by three degrees either side of the normal temperature of 18°C. Additionally, each room can be adjusted by any amount between 14°C and 25°C at the front desk.

The hotel's rooms are equipped with modern technology to cater to business travelers. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has also taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms.

To keep up with the latest technology, the hotel has laid extra cables to handle future improvements. The televisions are rented, so they can be easily replaced with newer models. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.

Despite the presence of modern technology, the hotel has tried to make guests feel comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The hotel's restaurant, led by Chef Patrick Guilbaud, serves excellent food. The chef has designed a new kitchen and taken advantage of the hotel's modern facilities. The hotel also offers better parking facilities than its previous location. With its modern technology and capable staff, the Merrion Hotel is well-equipped to succeed.

**Where Do These Women Get Their Energy?**

We asked six women who live life to the full to share their secrets. Here's what they said:

A. Jeanette Kupfermann, journalist and author: ""I think excitement is key. I need to be doing something new and challenging. I'm learning flamenco dancing right now, and it gives me a lot of energy. Dancing is great because it's expressive and fun. When I'm doing something I enjoy, I don't feel drained or unmotivated.""

B. Linda Kelsey, magazine editor: ""I love my job, so it doesn't feel like work. When I'm doing something I enjoy, I don't get tired easily. I need a good night's sleep to feel energized. Exercise helps too, but it's hard to find the motivation to do it. I try to do yoga once a week and some exercises at home. When I'm feeling low, I take a break and eat something to boost my mood.""

C. Annie Nightingale, disc jockey: ""I think being positive and enthusiastic is what gives me energy. I don't focus on healthy eating or exercise to get energized. I love my job and the excitement it brings. I enjoy taking photos and writing, too. When I'm doing something I love, I feel alive and energized.""

D. Floella Benjamin, author and children's TV presenter: ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy and believe in. I love working with kids because they're so full of energy and positivity. When I'm communicating with others, I feel a natural energy boost. Smiling at people and seeing them smile back is the best way to get energized.""

E. Deborah Moggach, author and playwright: ""I love transforming a neglected garden into something beautiful. It's more energizing than any workout or exercise. I also get energy from knowing that people want to read my writing. I like exploring nature, too - it's childlike and fun.""

F. Katherine Monblot, therapist: ""I believe you need to have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like taking risks and trying new things, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do can drain your energy. Focus on the things that matter most to you and direct your energy towards them.""<|eot_id|>"

Ice skating has a long history. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These skates were used until iron was introduced to Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, skating was considered an essential skill for the upper class. In the early 20th century, skating was seen as a stylish and exclusive activity. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie introduced a more athletic approach, which increased its popularity. Today, ice skating combines art and athleticism, requiring both elegance and physical fitness.

To start, it's essential to focus on balance and control. As you gain experience, you can increase your speed. The position of your body is crucial for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees slightly bent, which will help you stay centered. Relaxation is also vital for ice skating. For the starting position, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should be turned outwards. When moving forward, make small movements with one foot while keeping the other foot stationary.

Falling is a natural part of learning to skate, even for professionals. To minimize the impact of falling, try to stay relaxed. To get up, use your hands to get into a kneeling position and then stand up. Once you're comfortable moving on the ice, you can try different styles, such as figure skating, freestyle, and speed skating. However, it's best to start with figure skating and then move on to freestyle.

To improve your skating, it's essential to practice regularly and focus on relaxation. Look at professional skaters and notice how relaxed they are. To achieve this, incorporate exercises that target your legs, back, and shoulders into your routine. After a long or intense session, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness. Ice skating can improve your balance, coordination, and overall physical fitness. It can also be combined with swimming or jogging for a comprehensive fitness program.<|eot_id|>"

'The Joy and Hard Work of Being a Young Athlete

Three young athletes, Annika, Sarah, and Jane, share their experiences of competing in their respective sports. They talk about the pleasures and challenges they face.

Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. 'It's very demanding, and I don't have much time for TV, friends, or leisure activities. I try to take it one day at a time and focus on my training.'

Annika's mother agrees that her daughter's dedication is impressive. 'Annika has always shown great potential. It's not easy to achieve her level of success, but she loves it. She's become more confident and outgoing since starting gymnastics.'

Sarah Stokes, 15, has won the British National Championship in show-jumping. 'I love show-jumping events, they're exciting and fun. My parents help me train and take me to competitions. My goal is to qualify for the British young riders team and eventually win an Olympic gold medal.'

Sarah's mother is proud of her daughter's passion and determination. 'Sarah has always loved horses. She's well-organised and knows what she wants. It's great to see her succeed in something she loves.'

Jane McShane, 10, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. 'I enjoy playing chess with my friends. I try to focus, but sometimes I get distracted and don't think about the game. I don't like talking about my successes at school, I prefer to keep a low profile.'

Jane's mother is happy to support her daughter's passion for chess. 'Jane started playing chess when she was 5. She loved it from the beginning and quickly improved. I'm proud of her, but I wouldn't pressure her to continue if she wanted to stop.'

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

It's true that we're all getting taller. Chris Greener, who is now Britain's tallest man, was only 14 when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. His teacher asked him what he wanted to be, and Chris replied, ""The flagpole on a ship."" This was because Chris was already 2 meters tall at 14! Today, he is 228 cm tall.

Every year, people in Europe are getting a little taller. This is because our ancestors used to eat a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. This is what our bodies were meant to eat. However, when people started farming, they began to eat more carbohydrates like wheat, rice, and maize. This diet has had negative effects on our health and physique.

For centuries, people have been eating soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study, scientists found that when people started eating corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. It's only recently that people have started to eat a more balanced diet again, which is why the average height in some countries like the US, Holland, and Japan is increasing.

But there are problems with this trend. For example, beds and planes are still the same size, and clothes manufacturers are having to make new sizes. It's hard to say how tall we can get. Some scientists think we might reach 193 cm, but others say we might actually be shrinking. During the last ice age, humans were slightly rounder and taller because they needed to keep warm. Since the climate warmed up, we've gotten thinner and smaller. As the planet continues to heat up, we might even shrink more.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be part of a TV studio audience? I recently had the chance to find out. Many people think that studio audiences are made up of people who are desperate for their 15 minutes of fame. But the truth is, they come from all walks of life and are chosen for specific TV shows.

I thought that studio audiences were only for people who loved TV and wanted to be on camera. But it's not just about that. Some people do it because a friend gave them a ticket, while others are curious to see how TV is made. I spoke to Angela, who said she came because it was a chance to appear on TV. Others enjoy the excitement of being part of a live show and feeling like they're part of the action.

Watching a TV show from the studio is different from watching it at home. You're sitting among strangers, and you might even get signs telling you when to clap or laugh. But not all TV shows need these signs, and some people prefer the live experience. For example, Claire thought it was more exciting to see a comedian live, while Charlotte enjoyed the feeling of being part of a live show.

I was surprised to find that being in a studio audience wasn't just about watching TV - it was a fun and free night out. Despite the potential drawbacks, many people enjoy the experience and would do it again.<|eot_id|>"

I prefer landscapes with a human touch. When I travel, I'm drawn to villages with old temples, not deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England and loved exploring the countryside. I'd cycle to the village of Lastingham, where I felt at home. I even kept a diary of my adventures, which was my first attempt at travel writing.

I also enjoy taking the miniature train from Hythe to Dungeness. It's not a thrilling journey, but I love seeing the ordinary scenes of everyday life. We pass through people's back gardens, and for a moment, we get a glimpse into their daily routines. It's the simple things that make me appreciate the beauty of the landscape.

Sophia loves the remote and beautiful coast of Hartland Peninsula. The beaches are hard to reach, and there are no crowds. It's a place for surfers and those who want to reflect on the power of the sea. The coast is known for shipwrecks, and there are beautiful walks you can take inland to explore the valleys and forests.

Annette's favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a vast and empty moorland perfect for hiking. It's a place where you can feel the space and freedom. She discovered it by chance and has been returning every year, sometimes alone, sometimes with her family.

James bought his favorite house in Britain, Glenthorne, to find peace and reconnect with his English roots. He grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon and loved cycling around the moors and village streets. Glenthorne is a magical and secluded house where he can hear only the sound of the sea, wind, and birds.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a C1 learner:

We love animals and enjoy having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work with exciting news. She had found a beautiful pine snake and asked if we could keep it. I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank for temporary visitors, and I thought it would be a nice experience for my kids to learn about the snake.

I was running late, so I quickly started boiling some water when my sons shouted for help from their bedroom. I rushed in to find Domino the cat chasing Bianca the white mouse around the room. Domino had caught the mouse, but was trying to find a way out to enjoy his catch. I joined the chaos and tripped over something, ending up on the floor. As I tried to think of what to do, I saw the snake had escaped and was slithering around the room. I crouched down, ready to grab it, but it was too fast.

The snake was hissing and striking at everything, including my kids, who were screaming and jumping around. The cat was barking wildly, and the dog was barking too. I managed to capture the cat and free the mouse, but not before the snake had slithered all over the floor.

I sat down on the floor, trying to catch my breath, and looked at the snake. It was very powerful and had no weak points. I eventually managed to pick it up and release it at the end of the garden, pointing it towards a nearby tree. To my surprise, it curled up around my shoulders and seemed to be making itself comfortable for the winter.

My kids and I stood there in silence for a moment, then my eldest son broke the silence with a scientific explanation. He said the snake liked the warmth and comfort of my body and the shed was too cold. I encouraged the kids to gently push the snake towards the wall, and it slowly made its way up and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of tail disappeared, my three-year-old son said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!""

'Letter Writing: A Lost Art?'

In today's world of emails, texts, and social media, the art of letter writing is in danger of disappearing. But for me, there's something special about receiving a letter. The excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it's from, and the joy of reading the contents - it's an experience that can't be replicated by any other form of communication.

I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember. My mother encouraged me to write thank-you notes for gifts, even if they were short or messy. When I moved to London to become a doctor, I would write to my parents once a week, and they would do the same. My father's long, funny letters were always a treat.

Most of the letters were about everyday things, like what was happening at home and with friends. We also made phone calls, but it's the letters that I remember most. I've had penpals from all over the world, including Sri Lanka, Australia, and France. One of my penpals, whom I met in a restaurant, has become a close friend. We've even stayed at each other's homes.

My biggest success with letter writing was when my family and I visited my American penpal in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years, but this was the first time we had met. The local newspaper even wrote about our long-distance friendship on the front page.

I'm glad to see that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you notes. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penpals of their own, thanks to my penfriend. I urge everyone to keep writing letters - it's a special way to connect with others.

The ancient rock art in the French Alps is being damaged at an alarming rate. The site, which is over 4,000 years old, contains 36,000 drawings of cows, fields, and gods. However, as more tourists visit the site, the drawings are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti. The chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, Jean Clottes, says that if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years.

Tourists are the main culprits, as they often step on the drawings, wear away the rock, and even take pieces of the artwork as souvenirs. Some visitors even use sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or names on the rocks. Researchers are divided on the best way to preserve the site. Some believe that it should be turned into a ""no-go"" area, only allowing guided tours. Others think that this would be too drastic and that a more practical solution is needed.

The regional architect, David Lavergne, suggests that the site should remain open to visitors, but with measures in place to prevent damage. However, he acknowledges that this would require more funding. Annie Echassoux, who worked on researching the site, believes that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. She emphasizes that the Ministry of Culture has classified the site as a historic monument and that it is their responsibility to ensure its preservation for future generations.

Shopping with children can be very challenging for mothers. They often ask for everything they see, from sugary cereals to Disney videos and comics. Parents feel guilty if they give in to their demands, as they know it's not good for their children. On the other hand, saying no can be frustrating and lead to arguments. Research shows that children make a purchase request every two minutes while shopping with their parents. The advertising industry spends a lot of money on promoting products directly to children, especially on television. Children often don't understand why their parents can't afford certain things, and the persuasive advertisements can be very effective.

According to Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance, most parents are concerned about what they feed their children and have their own ideas about healthy food. However, these ideas are not always accurate. It's essential for parents and children to have a conversation about food and products, as children might only learn about them from advertisements. Parents feel they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced to repeatedly disappoint their children.

Some parents find it stressful to decide which demands to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but still feels unhappy about managing their shopping requests. Another mother has taught her son to be critical of advertisements, so they rarely have conflicts while shopping.

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's requests. For example, they might refuse to buy sweets because they're bad for their children, but then buy chocolate for themselves. Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. This could attract more customers who would be willing to shop without their children's demands.

""Climbing has become more accessible and challenging, not just in mountains, but also indoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, French climber Francois Lombard is hanging upside down from his fingertips. The National Indoor Arena, known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, has been transformed into a climbing arena thanks to new technology.

In the past, climbers had to wait for good weather or climb on snow and ice in Scotland during the winter. However, as the sport grew, top climbers needed to stay fit all year round. They started using brick-edges and stone buildings to train, focusing on finger strength. This led to the construction of climbing walls in sports centers, using special bricks with edges. One pioneer, Don Robinson, built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s, using natural rock set in concrete.

However, these early walls had limitations. They were only vertical, unlike real cliffs, and couldn't be changed once built. Climbers would eventually get bored with the same holds. In 1985, a French inventor, Francois Savigny, developed a material that could be molded into shapes similar to those found on cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted to try something new. Later, French manufacturers experimented with steel frames and interchangeable fixtures, allowing for endless combinations of holds. This technology has made indoor climbing more exciting and challenging, with possibilities for climbers to train and compete anywhere.""<|eot_id|>"

If you want to become an actor, you can be sure that people will warn you that it's a risky career. And they're right - the demand for actors is lower than the number of people who want to be one. When you decide to pursue acting, some friends might think you're crazy, while others might be more supportive. Everyone will have different advice for you. Ultimately, it's a personal choice, and you're responsible for your own success.

There's no easy way to become an actor - no exams to pass or guarantees of success. It's a combination of luck and talent. But there are always opportunities for new faces and new talent, and the chance to experience excitement, glamour, and financial rewards.

Many people have asked me to define what makes someone talented. I think it's a combination of natural ability and imagination. Imagination is the hardest part to measure. It's also important to have the courage to believe in yourself and your work.

So, why do people want to act? It's often hard to explain, but for many actors, it's the thrill of connecting with an audience. This connection is what drives all actors, whether they're on stage or screen. When asked how they've achieved success, actors often shrug and say they don't know. They might know some things about themselves and their craft, but they take nothing for granted, because they know their success can be short-lived. Disappointment is the biggest threat to an actor's confidence.

Actors often don't talk about their chances of getting a part because they know it's not guaranteed. They develop ways to cope with the stress and rejection that comes with auditioning. Nobody likes being rejected, and it's a possibility from the moment you start looking for acting jobs. You need to be willing to take risks and show that you care about your work, because if you don't, nobody else will.<|eot_id|>"

It's true that humans are getting taller. Chris Greener, a man from Britain, is the tallest person in the country, standing at 228 cm. This is because the average height of people in Europe is increasing by one centimetre every decade. More and more people are born who are above average height.

However, this doesn't mean that humans are becoming a new species. In fact, we're returning to our natural height, which was common in the past. Our ancestors used to eat a varied diet, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. This diet helped them grow tall and strong.

But about 9,000 years ago, people started farming and eating more carbohydrates like wheat, rice, and maize. This diet was not as good for our health and physique. Over time, we became shorter and less healthy. In one study, scientists found that when hunter-gatherers started eating corn, they became sickly and underweight.

In recent years, people in some countries like the US, Europe, and Japan have started to eat a more varied diet again, and this has led to an increase in height. The average height in these countries is now around 177-180 cm.

However, there are some concerns about the impact of this trend. For example, bed lengths and legroom in planes and trains haven't increased, and clothes manufacturers have to constantly update their sizes. Scientists are also wondering if there is a limit to how tall humans can grow. Some think it could be around 193 cm, but others believe that as a species, we may actually be getting smaller due to climate change.

Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers from Santa Fe, New Mexico, have turned their childhood game, pichenotte, into a successful business. They are sitting in their home, surrounded by the wooden board and plastic pieces of the game. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, introduced the game to their family when they were growing up. The family would play pichenotte every weekend and holiday, and visitors would often be fascinated by the game, which was unknown in the southern United States.

One day, Dave decided to make a new pichenotte board, and it was a hit. People loved the game, and soon the brothers were making more boards to sell at markets and craft fairs. The game's popularity grew, and they even started holding championships and creating a trophy, the Lord Pichenotte Cup.

As the demand for the game increased, the brothers decided to turn their hobby into a full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and started producing more boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. They are available for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Although there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, the brothers are hopeful that their game will become more popular and even turn their garage into a luxury car showroom. For now, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they love and building their business.

**Welcome to the Model Village**

When you first enter the Model Village, you might find it hard to believe that just a few years ago, this was a neglected piece of land covered in brambles. For years, it was considered worthless. However, with the careful planning and hard work of one man and his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful village you see today.

Thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to create the unique landscape you see before you. Although machines helped with the transformation, it also required a lot of manual labor. Once the shape was achieved, we added a layer of topsoil to create the lawns, flowerbeds, and rockeries.

We planted hundreds of trees and shrubs, carefully selecting those that could tolerate the salty air and strong winds in this exposed location. Some plants even came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 individual models over nine years. The models are made from a variety of materials, including stone, concrete, and wood, to withstand different weather conditions. Colin learned a lot from experts and eventually became an expert himself.

You'll notice that every detail is carefully considered and that the models are all to scale. This was achieved through patience and innovative construction techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance.

The models are not based on specific real-life places or structures, but rather showcase traditional British architectural styles. You'll see a variety of buildings, including a 13th-century-style manor house, a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course.

Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models, as this could cause damage. You're welcome to take photos from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are allowed on a short lead. We appreciate any feedback you may have, as we're always looking to improve and add new models.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again soon. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 level learner:

British newspapers often publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules of journalism. While some celebrities might agree to have their photos taken by paparazzi, this is not common. Most people in the public eye are upset when their private moments are captured on the front page. However, very few of them complain to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization that deals with issues like this. The pictures are rarely in the public interest. For example, a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony didn't help keep anyone safe or protect public health. The actress had a right to privacy, but she didn't take action.

The PCC should have investigated this incident, but it didn't. The same thing happened with a recent story about a pop star's personal life. The star didn't complain either. It seems like the PCC should take the initiative in cases like these, but there are many problems with this idea. The PCC would have to decide whether to investigate each case, and how to handle it. It would also have to deal with celebrities who might feel their privacy was invaded, but don't want to make a fuss. Additionally, the PCC would have to monitor all British newspapers, which would be a huge task.

There are also concerns about the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy was invaded, they might not want to go through the process of an investigation. Some people might be worried that a worse story about them could come out if they complain. A comedian who was a victim of the press twice didn't complain because he was afraid the newspaper would use the pictures to create a new story. It's hard to find a solution to this serious problem.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, targeted at a C1 learner:

Many people receive advice on finding their first job after college. But what about those who are looking for a second job? This article is not about people who are looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one. Nor is it about those who leave a job after just a few weeks. Instead, we are focusing on those who are taking a step up in their career, choosing a job that fits with their long-term goals and ambitions.

When looking for a second job, it's essential to think about your long-term plans. Do you want to specialize in a particular field, take on more responsibilities, or move into a new area? Whatever your goal, you should choose your second job carefully, as you will likely stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job, as it will show that you have thought carefully about your career and are committed to your goals.

It's also a good idea to consider traveling while you're young. You can take a break, do some temporary work when you return, and then find a new job that is a good fit for you. This can be attractive to future employers, as it shows that you are adventurous and willing to take risks.

Juliette Davidson, for example, worked for three solicitors after leaving college. She found the job to be a good introduction to the world of work, but there were no opportunities for advancement. She decided to take a break and travel for a year before returning to the UK and finding a new job as a Personal Assistant to the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. In just two and a half years, Juliette has taken on more responsibilities and her job has grown. Her boss has been keen to develop her skills and has given her specific projects to work on.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Confident people often seem born with it, but most will tell you that confidence is a skill they've developed over time. Nina Hathway asked five people how they did it.

A Jenny When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. But when I helped out at my daughter's school, I surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course, and I was nervous at first, but my confidence grew as I became more outgoing. Looking back, that experience was a turning point in my life that helped everything else fall into place.

B Michaela Four years ago, my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was scared, but I learned to believe in myself. When things get tough, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. I also try to calm my fears by talking to myself.

C Lisa People think I'm confident, but in reality, I'm often very nervous. I've learned to appear confident because it's important in my job in TV. I've realized that everyone gets nervous in important situations, but speaking to someone friendly can help calm us down. My mother once told me, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves."" I've found that's good advice.

D Barbara My confidence comes from enjoying my work and learning from my mistakes. If you just focus on getting things done and learn from your mistakes, you'll become more confident over time. I work hard and am popular at my restaurant, but I don't let negative feedback affect me. You have to like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others expect.

E Kim After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak up in meetings. Eventually, I gained the confidence to share my opinions. When I started working in politics, I was nervous about speaking in public, but I reminded myself that it's normal to feel scared. I also found it helpful to prepare by writing down my thoughts. I believe that anyone can be confident if they tell themselves, ""Nothing is impossible.""

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I visited Malaysia and attended a kite-flying festival in the state of Kelantan. Adnan Ali, a local, gave me a kite he had made and told me that it was traditional for the finder to keep it. He showed me his collection of kites, all made of tissue paper and bamboo, and we sat down to watch the competition. The festival was held on the Beach of the Seven Lagoons, where competitors flew their kites from 10 platforms. The kites were judged on their decoration, stability, and flying efficiency.

Adnan invited me to visit him at his home to learn how to make kites, but I had to decline. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur. I took a wrong turn and ended up at a river, where I took a boat to the other side. I then followed a sign to the Jelawang Jungle and hiked up a steep and slippery path. Along the way, I met Baba, who ran a tented kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there for the night, despite the insects and the sounds of the forest.

The next morning, I woke up to a stunning view of the surrounding mountains. Later, it started raining, and I had to slide down the hill, worried about the giant butterflies and the risk of being swept away. When I finally made it back to my car, I was relieved to find it still there, covered in mud. Everywhere I went, people were friendly and curious, asking me questions about where I was from and how old I was. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of its people.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced the number of complex sentences and rephrased them for easier understanding
* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removed some of the more technical details about the kite-making process
* Emphasized the main events and experiences of the story

There are different types of shoppers. Do you know which one you are? Abby Edwards asked people about their shopping habits.

Some people love shopping and can't resist buying things. Melanie, a 22-year-old dancer, is an example. She enjoys shopping and often goes with her boyfriend, who shares her passion for buying things.

Others may not enjoy shopping as much. Brenda, a 40-year-old office manager, is a reluctant shopper. She doesn't like buying clothes and usually only shops for essentials.

Some people are careful shoppers who know what they want and don't waste time. Juliet, a 28-year-old personnel manager, is one of these. She only shops when she really needs something and doesn't like browsing.

Then there are those who like to look around but don't spend much. Anita, a 35-year-old TV producer, is a good example. She knows what she wants and gets in and out of the shops quickly.

Some people dislike shopping altogether. Lizzie, a 41-year-old secretary, finds it stressful and rarely has to shop for clothes. When she does, she prefers to go to the local supermarket.

Others enjoy shopping but are careful not to overspend. Lisa, a 22-year-old actress, likes to go shopping with her friends and often ends up buying something she likes.

Some people are happy shoppers who enjoy browsing and buying things. Suki, a 26-year-old art gallery assistant, is a careful shopper who likes to take her time and find the best deals.

Finally, there are those who only shop on certain days or at certain times. Ann-Marie, a 29-year-old nursery worker, loves shopping, but only on weekdays and never on Saturdays.

And then there are those who are unwilling shoppers who only go out of necessity. Linda, a 32-year-old restaurant manager, works in the city centre and finds shopping unappealing. She only goes shopping when she really needs something and doesn't bother trying things on.

These are just a few examples of the different types of shoppers. Do you identify with any of these?<|eot_id|>"

For a group of children aged 10-15, Saturdays are spent learning the art of cooking. They attend small classes, which are very popular - there's even a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to cook delicious meals. One student, Bill, aged 10, loves cooking and says he can now make better meals than his mom. He enjoys the classes because the teachers make them laugh, especially when they share the food they've made. Another student, Flora, is 12 and has been struggling with chopping onions. She loves cooking and recently made a meal for her friends, which they all enjoyed. Her mom suggested she take up a new hobby instead of just staying at home, and Flora is glad she did. Their teacher, Philippe, says the classes are a lot of fun. He finds that children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen can get a bit messy! He believes that if parents encourage their children to cook when they're young, they'll have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home.

What is money? Money is like a measure, just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can trade it for something else. A £5 note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that's almost free to make. A long time ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green the farmer would trade his corn for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a deal between two people, each with something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own money systems so people could trade more easily. The different systems eventually joined together, which is why we use a national currency today.<|eot_id|>"

Hypatia was a woman who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, over 1,600 years ago. She was one of the first women to make a significant contribution to science. Her father was the director of a university, and he made sure she had access to a good education. This was unusual at the time, as women had limited opportunities to study. Hypatia studied in Athens and Rome before returning to Alexandria, where she became a teacher of mathematics. She was known for her knowledge of new ideas and wrote several important books on mathematics. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented tools to help with her work.

'Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grass, and they can be found in every region on Earth. Grass is able to grow in extreme environments, from the freezing Arctic to the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide variety of animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass is very good at recovering after it's cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from the roots, not from the top of the plant. This means that many animals can live together in the same area without running out of food. As soon as the grass is eaten, new growth starts again, providing a fresh meal for the animals.'

Kal Kaur Rai, the winner of the Young Achiever of the Year award, has always been passionate about fashion. As a child, she loved drawing clothes and designing patterns. However, she didn't tell her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream of making a career out of it. She thought they expected her to join a more traditional business, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. At industry events, she couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her designs and asked her to make clothes for them. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs on a trial basis, and they were very successful. This encouraged her to leave her job and start her own women's clothing label with a £20,000 loan. Her parents, surprisingly, were supportive of her decision, which made her very happy. Today, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business generates over £500,000 in income.

The idea of building a railway between Darwin and Adelaide was first considered in the 1920s, but it was a difficult project due to frequent flooding. The new railway was completed just before my journey. The train is designed for speeds of up to 115 kph, but it's not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are tourists. The train wasn't originally built for passengers, but for transporting goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's southern cities via Darwin and the train would be faster and cheaper than shipping them around the continent. The Ghan is the world's first north-south transcontinental railway. As I waited to board the train, I could see that everyone was excited to start their journey. The majority of my fellow passengers were Australian pensioners. Our first stop was Katherine, where we waited for four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip up the gorge, but I stayed on the train. At Alice Springs, I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is no longer allowed, so we just walked around it and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs wasn't very interesting - just flat land with cattle. But on the third day, at dawn, we reached the foothills of an area near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train didn't quite live up to its promises, it took me to some of Australia's most amazing sights.<|eot_id|>"

Climbing Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Britain, is a challenging experience. Many people attempt to climb it every year. In winter, the weather can be very cold and harsh. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience climbing Ben Nevis for the first time. It was a big winter climb, and we planned to spend three days on the mountain. We carried heavy backpacks with tents, sleeping bags, and special crampons for our boots. The snow was so hard it was like walking on ice, so we needed the crampons to stay safe.

Although some of our group were experienced climbers, we still took all the necessary safety equipment, including lights and extra clothing. The weather forecast was good, but we were still a bit nervous as we set out. Ben Nevis is always a challenge, especially in winter. The track was steep, and my legs felt heavy. As the weakest member of the group, I had to rest more often. The others would stop to let me catch up, but then they would continue climbing again. I learned that I should train more before climbing in the future.

After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the route to the top of Ben Nevis. It's a narrow path, only one and a half meters wide, with a steep drop on both sides. We had to be careful and focus on every step as we made our way slowly along it. It took us seven hours to reach the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, we weren't lucky enough to have a clear view, as a mist had rolled in. Getting down the mountain can be just as challenging as climbing up. You need to be able to read a map correctly to avoid taking a wrong turn, which could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was relieved we took turns doing this job. Only when I was safely back in my tent could I say I really enjoyed the experience. At least I made it to the top.

I made some changes to the original text to simplify it while keeping the main ideas and facts intact. I:

* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases
* Simplified sentence structures and grammar
* Removed some details that were not essential to the main story
* Added transitional phrases to connect the ideas in the text

Our new school is amazing! It's made entirely of wood, just like our old school, but it's also very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, and we watched it being built. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land and start construction, but it was also sad to see the open space go. The noise from the machines was loud, and the builders had to stop work when it rained. We thought the building would never be finished! 

Now we have five big classrooms, which are much bigger than our old school. We share one room with the town for meetings and events. There's also a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. When you enter the school, you'll notice that there are no heaters. Instead, the heat comes from us, the children, teachers, and computers. The building is designed to keep the heat inside and block out the noise, so it feels like a concert hall when we sing in class!

You'll also notice a tree on the roof! The builders put it there as a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for the lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it yesterday and took pictures to put on our website. Although we're already using the school, there are still some parts to be finished, like a new stage for our school play. We're very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn even better now that we're in it!<|eot_id|>"

'A month ago, I wouldn't have believed that I'd be 30 meters above the ground on a Saturday afternoon in November, enjoying it. Now, looking down at the river below, I understand why people like rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't luxurious, but it had everything we needed, and we were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. We were from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning, and the others went rock climbing. We switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went caving first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after some effort, we finally made it out - covered in mud but happy and excited about what we'd done.'

'A letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday, I accidentally left my handbag on the bus. It had my cheque book, address book, and purse with £50 in cash and some credit cards inside. When I realized what had happened, it was too late. I was worried because I'm 72 years old, far from home, and didn't know what to do. I even cried by the side of the road. A young man asked me what was wrong and I told him what had happened. He gave me some money to get home. When I told the bus driver, he said I didn't have to pay the fare. I got home safely and soon the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He told me they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. Miraculously, everything was still inside, including the money and credit cards. I want to thank everyone who helped me that day for their kindness and honesty. Mrs. B. James, Newport.'

""Sharks are some of the most fascinating creatures in the ocean. They have adapted to their underwater environment in a unique way. Their excellent eyesight and special sensors on their bodies help them detect movement and find prey. This makes them formidable predators, especially for smaller sea creatures. Despite their similarities to other fish, sharks have distinct characteristics. For instance, they need to keep swimming constantly to breathe and stay alive, so they don't sleep much. Additionally, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can remain still, which is helpful for researchers who need to handle them. This allows scientists to learn more about these intriguing creatures.""

THE ICEHOTEL

For many years, the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in winter, the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. In the late 1980s, people started to see the winter as an opportunity. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a special igloo in the town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The exhibition was a success, and the idea of an ice hotel was born.

Today, the ICEHOTEL is world-famous. Every year, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They work on different parts of the hotel at the same time, so some parts are already open for visitors and guests while others are still being built. The hotel usually opens in December and is completed by January 7th.

The ICEHOTEL is built outside, using natural materials like snow and ice. This means that the finishing date can change depending on the weather. In the spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts away.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it's very cold outside. Guests can borrow warm clothing like overalls, hats, and gloves when they arrive. It's also a good idea to bring your own warm clothes, like sweaters and socks, and choose shoes that are a bit larger to fit thick socks.

If you're planning to visit the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and other equipment on the ICEHOTEL website when you book your stay. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, near the Arctic Circle, but close to Kiruna airport and train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, had to close unexpectedly after just opening its doors at midnight last Thursday. Thousands of people showed up, attracted by special deals, including a leather sofa for £45 and a bed for £30. The shop usually operates from 9 am to 9 pm, but it had announced that it would stay open 24 hours for its first day. However, it had to close just half an hour after opening due to the large crowd. A police officer who was called to the scene said that the crowd was not patient and became angry when they couldn't get in quickly. The shop was full, and people refused to queue quietly until there was space inside. Another issue was the long line of cars trying to park, which caused congestion on the road. Some people even left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the rest of the way to the shop, blocking the road completely. One customer, Jenny Smith, managed to get in and said she had to queue for three hours but didn't have time to buy what she wanted. She praised the staff for being calm and understanding, saying they didn't have a choice due to safety concerns. Jenny plans to return to the shop when it reopens, but she won't queue again.

* Simplified vocabulary: I replaced complex words like ""hurried"" with ""showed up"", ""sensibly"" with ""understood"", and ""refused to queue quietly"" with ""became angry when they couldn't get in quickly"".

Tanya Streeter is a world-renowned free-diver who has set four world records in the sport. Free-diving involves diving to great depths without breathing apparatus, using only one's own breath. In 2003, Tanya made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean without breathing and then swim back up to the surface without assistance. This feat took her over three and a half minutes to complete, making her the only female to break a world record previously held by a man.

Tanya emphasizes the importance of safety and training in free-diving, which involves diving to different depths and then swimming back up. She spends most of her training time in the gym, pool, and ocean, using an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness. She avoids running to protect her knees and prefers fast walking to build her overall fitness.

Before competing, Tanya travels to a new location and does 14 dives over a four-week period, with a rest day in between each dive. She must stay fit and avoid getting tired, as this could ruin her preparation. When not preparing for an event, Tanya makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations by participating in research projects and making documentaries.

Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, where she spent her childhood swimming and exploring rockpools to observe marine life. She believes her life today is like living her childhood dreams. As a well-known figure, she thinks people are more likely to listen to her when she talks about environmental issues. Looking to the future, Tanya plans to continue breaking her own world records and is not planning to retire from the sport for many years to come, as she started free-diving at the age of 25.

Norwich is a city in East Anglia, a region in the east of England. It has a long history, dating back over 2,000 years. Originally, it was a small village near the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has been an important centre for many religions, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, the city celebrated its 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which gave it the right to govern itself.

Although Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of around 150,000, it has a rich history. In the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. Over the next 300 years, it continued to grow and became famous for its many churches and pubs. Today, while there are fewer churches and pubs, the city is home to the University of East Anglia, which was established in 1964. This has brought a new generation of students to the city, along with a range of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and leisure centres. The city also has a football team, known as 'The Canaries', although the reason for this name is unclear.

Norwich has undergone significant development in recent years. A major shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall' was built, and a large park was created on top of the old car park. The park features attractive water features and hundreds of trees. Despite this change, the old open market remains at the heart of the city, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined its old and new features.

Every autumn, the Albuquerque Balloon Festival takes place in the desert city of Albuquerque, USA. The festival started in 1972 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local radio station. Initially, there were just a dozen hot-air balloons, but it has grown significantly since then. This year, over 1,000 balloons from around the world are expected to attend.

During the festival, pilots communicate with each other and simultaneously light up their balloons, creating a beautiful spectacle known as a 'balloon glow'. To see this, you need to arrive at the festival site just before nightfall or after 5:30 am.

During the day, you can walk around the balloons and chat with the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes, shapes, and colors, including animals, cartoon characters, and well-known brands. Kids will love it.

You can also take a balloon ride over the desert or ride the world's longest cable car to the top of the nearby mountains for a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other activities for all ages, including balloon races and fireworks displays on certain evenings.

The Albuquerque Box is a unique wind pattern that makes it ideal for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle currents at different heights, allowing skilled pilots to control their direction.

Practical tips: Buy your tickets online in advance to avoid long queues. Wear layers of thin clothing, as it can be cool in the morning and night, but hot during the day. Bring a flashlight, camera, and suncream.

I made the following changes:

* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary
* Removed complex phrases and sentences
* Added more concrete details to help the reader understand the festival
* Changed some technical terms to make them more accessible (e.g., ""balloon glows"" instead of ""the burners of their balloons"")
* Emphasized the practical tips at the end to make it easier for the reader to plan their visit.<|eot_id|>"

The Eden Project is a popular tourist attraction in the south-west of England. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on the former industrial site look like something from a science fiction movie. Each biosphere simulates a different climate zone, highlighting the importance of the relationship between humans and plants. It's astonishing to see how many everyday products come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different plant species are grown here. Despite the cold weather outside, the plants are kept at the right temperature using computer-controlled electric heaters. The Rainforest Zone has a humid atmosphere due to a large waterfall. Another zone recreates the environments of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and plans are underway to build a desert zone in the near future.

The latest collection, New Writing 3, has received some criticism, but I don't understand why. For £6.99, you get 500 pages of original writing, which is an incredible deal. The book mostly features fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are some great pieces by well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the lesser-known writers mostly wrote about food. I recommend avoiding Jane Harris' story, ""Those Nails"", after meals, as it contains some unpleasant scenes that might make you feel queasy. The book also includes fine poetry from 19 poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You'll find excerpts from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Additionally, there's some non-fiction, including a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about newspapers and a fascinating piece about herself by Ursula Owen. Overall, this is an exceptional collection, and I'm looking forward to seeing what next year's edition will bring.

""According to violinist and music teacher Margaret Porter, the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. At this age, children are naturally curious and eager to learn about the world around them. Margaret prefers to take on students who are three or four years old, although she has made exceptions for very enthusiastic five-year-olds. When she started teaching in 1972, her first class consisted of her own children's school friends who were five years old.

Margaret's students have group lessons, which last about an hour and take place every two weeks. Each student also has a weekly one-on-one lesson with her. It's essential that parents attend the lessons and take an active interest in their child's learning. From the very beginning, students learn to play by ear, rather than reading music. They don't start reading music until they've been playing for several years. There can be a significant difference between their ability to play and read music. Margaret's teaching method is not designed to produce world-class violinists, and she often suggests that students who show exceptional talent should consider studying with a more traditional teacher.""<|eot_id|>"

Moonshine, a popular band, has just released their third CD, called ""Here Again"". This CD is a follow-up to their previous album ""The Waves"". There have been some changes in the band since then. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has also joined the band as the drummer. From the first song on the CD, it's clear that the band is focusing more on upbeat and energetic music, rather than slow songs. The second song is also a fast-paced dance tune and is even louder and heavier than the first one. The rest of the album returns to the band's usual slower style. These two fast songs might surprise some fans, but they are excellent and could easily become hit singles. The singer, Rob Letchford, gets to show off his skills in these songs and hits each note perfectly. Unfortunately, Rob had to record the songs before he had trouble with his throat, which has forced the band to cancel their upcoming tour. However, fans who have already bought tickets don't need to worry - the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered. On this CD, Moonshine shows that they can produce great music in different styles, from slow and familiar to fast and energetic. While the last few tracks aren't as strong as the first ones, ""Here Again"" is still sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band.<|eot_id|>"

San Francisco is a city located on the west coast of California, in the United States. The first Europeans to visit the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who arrived in 1769. What's interesting is that San Francisco Bay is a natural harbour, but it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, thousands of people came to San Francisco in search of gold. However, it wasn't the gold miners who became rich. Instead, the wealthy people made their money from banking and law firms, and they built grand houses on one of the hills, known as Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous landmarks like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many people also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the former prison.

'History of Shoes

In the past, people didn't worry much about whether shoes were comfortable or fashionable. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins, which people wore around their ankles for warmth. Today, we still use leather, but also other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton, depending on what's in style. It wasn't until about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, the two shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. Until recently, all shoes were made by hand, but now most are mass-produced in factories. The introduction of sewing machines made it possible to produce large quantities of shoes at a lower cost, making them more affordable for a wider range of people.'

So, I started a women's running group in my area. I put up posters and 40 women joined, ranging from young to old, fit to unfit. At first, they were mostly interested in losing weight, but they didn't really think about the benefits of running. They had a negative image of running, thinking it would be painful and boring. But I wanted to show them that running can be fun, especially when done with friends in beautiful places. Now, after just a few weeks, they can run for 30 minutes without stopping. They've also learned from other runners about healthy eating and staying fit in general.

THE IDITAROD: THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH

In the 1880s, people discovered gold in Alaska, a state in the USA. Many people moved there to find gold. A town called Iditarod grew quickly and became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. In the winter, it was hard to get supplies to the town because the rivers and ocean were frozen. So, in 1910, a special path was built for dog teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for the dogs to travel across Alaska. The drivers would stop at special houses called roadhouses to rest and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s, when airplanes became a better way to travel. However, in 1925, a serious illness called diphtheria broke out in the town of Nome. The closest medicine was in Anchorage, but it was too far away. The only way to get the medicine was by using dog teams. Twenty teams of dogs worked together to deliver the medicine over 1,000 kilometers, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. The journey took six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian, and his dog Togo were the first to travel 400 kilometers of the journey. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen and his lead dog Saito. One of the dogs, Balto, saved the team from falling into icy water and became a hero. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the same route as the famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth.'

Welcome to Antarctica Sightseeing Flights! Here's what you need to know before booking your trip.

We take tourists on a 12-hour flight from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back in a large passenger plane (Boeing 747) during the brief Antarctic summer. The flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the date.

Frequently Asked Questions:

How long is the flight?

The average flight is 12 hours. We spend about four hours flying over Antarctica and the remaining time returning to Sydney. During the flight, you'll have the chance to see sea ice and icebergs, and our experts will talk about the environment and history of Antarctica.

Will I get a window seat?

All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you'll move to the seat shown on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half the flight, while economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half the flight.

What if the weather is bad?

We have 17 different flight plans, and our captain chooses the best route based on the satellite weather forecast on the morning of the flight. This ensures the best views for you.

Will I see penguins and other wildlife?

Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, so we can't see them clearly from the plane. We don't land on Antarctica due to environmental reasons. If you want to see Antarctic wildlife, you'll need to join a boat tour.

Can I take photos?

Yes, all cameras are welcome! We even have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold-weather clothes.

'Little Chefs: Cooking for Fun and Learning

One of the students, Bill, is 10 years old and loves cooking. He says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can even do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we share the food we've made.'

Another student, Flora, is 12 years old and loves cooking too. She says, 'I did a meal for my friends and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of just staying at home. At first, I wasn't too keen, but I'm glad I decided to join. Now, I'm really enjoying it.'

Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun! Children pay attention and remember things better than adults. And although the kitchen can get messy when they're cooking, it's worth it.

Winter driving can be challenging because it's hard to predict what will happen and accidents can happen easily. Fog can suddenly appear over a hill, and hidden ice beneath the snow can cause your car to skid off the road. A car approaching you might also slide across the road. To stay safe on icy roads, the most important thing is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make your car difficult to control, so make gentle and slow turns, gentle braking, and gradual speed changes. Imagine you're driving with a hot cup of coffee next to you - drive carefully so you don't spill it.

The second rule is to be aware of potential hazards. When there's a lot of ice, you need to look further ahead on the road. Test your stopping distance by slowing down gently. Remember that you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, increase your normal stopping distance by double on wet roads, triple on snowy roads, and even more on icy roads. Stay in control of your car at all times, and you'll avoid trouble.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Craigie Aitchison was a Scottish painter who was born in Scotland. Initially, he planned to study law in London, but he ended up enrolling in art school instead. He found traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government awarded him a grant to study art, which led him to become interested in early Italian artists. This influence is evident in some of his work. Aitchison was captivated by the vibrant greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light. He aimed to capture this light in his paintings by layering colours from light to dark. However, he admits that he never knows what the final result will be. ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself,"" he says. Aitchison believes that anyone can learn to mix colours, as they can be purchased. He simply notices what colours work well together. Unlike some artists, Aitchison doesn't create preliminary sketches before starting a painting. He thinks that if he does, he might lose interest in the project. Instead, he makes changes to his paintings multiple times before completing them. This is why he prefers to work with models who don't ask to see their portraits while he's painting. ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it,"" he explains. After moving to London, Aitchison felt disconnected from the Scottish art scene. He doesn't follow any specific artistic tradition and simply paints in his own way. Despite this, his work has influenced many young British artists.

Two years ago, my 14-year-old son, Ben, asked for a drum set for his birthday. At first, my husband and I were hesitant because of the noise. Ben argued that playing drums was better than watching TV or playing video games, and it would keep him out of trouble. We eventually agreed, but with one condition: he had to consider the rest of the family and the neighbors when he practiced.

As it turned out, Ben's friends in his band started coming over with their guitars and other equipment, and our house became a regular rehearsal space. For several hours a week, the noise of their instruments and singing fills our home. While it can be loud, Ben's hobby has had some benefits. Whenever the band practices, my husband and I take a long walk to get some exercise. I must admit that, although their music may not be my cup of tea, they're a friendly and polite group of young men.

I'm not sure about their musical talent, but they do play at local clubs for young people. Our main concern is that their musical activities might distract them from their schoolwork, but so far, that hasn't been the case. I constantly remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is certain, though - Ben was right: playing drums has kept him out of trouble and he's never bored.

Atlantic College is a private college in Wales that offers an exceptional education to students from all over the world. The students, aged 16 to 18, spend their mornings studying and afternoons engaging in practical activities that benefit the local community. These activities include helping on a farm, assisting people with special needs, or monitoring river pollution. What makes Atlantic College unique is its diverse student body, with students from various social backgrounds and countries. To make the college more accessible, the institution offers grants to help cover the fees, which are quite high at £20,000 over two years. A quarter of the students are from the UK, and many of them receive government support to attend. As one student from the Netherlands, Barbara Molenkamp, noted, ""I really appreciate the college's efforts to promote international understanding among young people. Living with people from different backgrounds helps you develop respect and tolerance, even towards those you may not initially get along with."" In summary, Atlantic College provides an excellent education that has a positive impact on its students.

As a 32-year-old, I've just finished my first year at university. It's been a big change from my previous job as a secretary, where I was stuck in a routine and felt unchallenged. I was earning a good income, but I was unhappy and felt like I was missing out on opportunities. I was envious of the students at the local university, who seemed carefree and full of hope. So, I decided to take the leap and go back to school.

However, I've found it challenging to connect with my younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I'm not qualified to answer. I also feel a bit disconnected from the lecturers because, although we're the same age, I don't have the same level of knowledge. Despite these challenges, I'm grateful for the opportunity to study. I know that having a degree is important for getting a fulfilling job, which is essential to me.

Unlike many 18-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends reading and studying rather than partying. I also appreciate the benefits that come with being a student, such as long holidays and discounts on theatre and cinema tickets. I sometimes worry about what I'll do after graduation, but I believe that pursuing my education at this stage in my life has been a wise decision.

I made some minor changes to the original text to make it more accessible to a C1 learner, including:

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He didn't like farming, so he started working as a mechanic when he was 15. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but lightweight steel to build affordable cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he introduced the Ford Model T, which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and affordable, but this meant there were limited options. Henry Ford famously said, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black,"" referring to the Model T.

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. Before her adventure, she was a journalist living in a small flat in south London. In 1993, she left her job and family to join a group of climbers in Asia. She found that climbing Everest was extremely challenging. ""You have to carry everything you need on your back,"" she explained. ""You can't even wash your hands, let alone take a shower. I didn't even bring a toothbrush because water is very heavy and scarce. We only took enough water to drink.""

When Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the most incredible moment of her life. After her achievement, she became famous overnight. She wrote a book about her experience and now often gives talks about it. She has also started a new job on a science program on TV.

Canada Geese are big birds with blue and white feathers. In the fall, they migrate to warmer places because it gets too cold in Canada. If they stay, they might die.

So, he decided to teach them to follow him. He took his small plane on short trips, and the young geese followed him all summer. When autumn arrived, Bill flew to Virginia, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and returned home.

ESTHER'S STORY

When Esther left school at 16, her aunt gave her £500 as a birthday gift. Most of her friends went to college, but Esther decided to use the money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and jars and began making her own jam. She sold it to her friends for £1 a jar and soon doubled her aunt's £500.

At first, her parents didn't think it was a good idea for Esther to spend her time making jam and wanted her to study instead. They hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. But Esther didn't listen to them. She kept making jam and soon started selling it at the local market. Later, she began making orange juice and sold it to a school where one of her friends worked.

After two years, her business grew big and her parents were very proud of her. She started making different kinds of food and selling it to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to hire some people to help her.

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler run the farm, where they keep cows, chickens, and sheep. They sell milk and eggs, but most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each one produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool to keep the sheep cool. Five years ago, Jenny made sweaters from the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. However, it was summer and people weren't interested in buying sweaters. So, she started making socks instead. They were a hit because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. This is how Jenny's business began.

Before people started farming, they had to constantly move to find food by gathering plants and fruits in the forest. This lifestyle was nomadic, and people had to keep searching for food sources. However, around 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to cultivate crops, marking the beginning of farming. This innovation allowed people to settle in one place and eventually, their villages grew larger. As farming became more established, some people were free to pursue other activities, such as crafting or weaving, as the farmers could provide food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was challenging during harsh weather conditions, leading to food shortages for some. Today, farming has become more advanced, and food is transported thousands of kilometers from where it's grown to our tables.

Most Indians prefer watching movies to any other leisure activity, and around 10 million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films typically tell romantic love stories and feature singing and dancing. Indian movies are also popular worldwide. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million from selling its films abroad. Despite producing more films than Hollywood, Indian actors are generally paid less. This is why Bollywood films usually cost around $2 million to make, whereas a Hollywood film never costs less than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers are relatively short. However, Amitabh Bachchan, considered India's greatest actor by many, has had a long and successful acting career, starring in over 140 films over nearly 40 years.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I was born in the United States, but I've written several books about England. My family and I lived there for 20 years, but we've been back in the United States for the past three years. My children are now learning about life in the United States. I'm sure they'll be happy because they've had the experience of living in two countries. I still have a special place in my heart for Britain and I'd like to return, but my daughter is starting college soon, so it will be a few years before we can go back. Recently, I spent six weeks in England working on a radio programme about the English language and promoting my new book. Most writers don't enjoy this type of travel, but I don't mind. I enjoy visiting new places and meeting new people. It's a big change from my daily life in the United States, where I usually write in one place. In England, I was driven around in nice cars and stayed in comfortable hotels. It was convenient because I didn't have to worry about paying bills. Everyone was very kind to me and it was a fun experience.

He also collected many cookbooks, both French and English, and now has over 250 of them. So, why did he decide to open his own restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Was it an easy decision?

As London grew and became a bigger city, crime became a bigger problem. Thieves would steal money from people on the streets, so people tried to stay at home as much as possible. In 1750, a man named Henry Fielding decided to pay a group of people to catch thieves. They were called the Bow Street Runners, named after the street where they worked. Over time, the number of Bow Street Runners grew to 120, but London still needed more police officers. In 1829, the first London Police Force was established, with 3,000 officers. Most of them walked, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men.

Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family for a beach holiday. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful gardens, but we were really interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a big square with seats on three sides. Three elephants and their keepers arrived and stood in front of a large white sheet of paper. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started painting on its own paper. Sometimes, the keepers gave them new brushes with fresh paint and took away the old ones. The elephants slowly created pictures under the guidance of their keepers. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree, and the third a bouquet of flowers. When the keepers showed us the finished paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch.

Twenty years ago, elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them and learn more about these amazing animals.""

Lions, on the other hand, are the only big cats that live in large family groups. They often hunt together to gather food for their group. Their habitat is typically flat, open terrain, allowing them to spot prey from a distance and follow it easily.

Thanks for your letter. I received it this morning. Yes, I'd love to see you. How about meeting outside my office at 1 o'clock? There's a good Italian restaurant nearby. Do you like Italian food? I have to go back to work at 2 o'clock, so please don't be late.

Best regards,
Mary

Dear Lorna,

I'm doing well. I've been thrilled to start a new job in the city centre. I work at the Tourist Information Office, which is really fascinating. My day starts at 7:30 am, so I have to wake up early. I enjoy this job because I get to meet people from all over the world and share information about our city with them. Here's a photo of me in my new uniform. What do you think of it?

Best regards,

'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, weighing over 90 kilograms. Most ostriches live in southern Africa, although their numbers are declining. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they are not able to fly. Instead, they use their wings to help them change direction when running. Ostriches are very fast runners, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometres per hour, making it challenging for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are similar in size to chickens and take around three years to mature. Ostriches are herbivores and can survive for several days without water.'

Changes made:

* Simplified sentence structure and vocabulary to make it easier to understand
* Removed some technical terms and replaced with more accessible language (e.g., ""adult can be more than 90 kilos"" became ""weighing over 90 kilograms"")
* Added a few words to make the text more fluent and natural-sounding (e.g., ""although their numbers are declining"" instead of ""but there are only a few of them left"")

Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding at the age of 20. Now, at 23, she has won many competitions. We spoke to her at a competition in Switzerland and asked why she started snowboarding. 'I've always enjoyed sports, especially skiing. It seemed natural to try snowboarding. You can learn quickly and get good at it in a few months.'

We asked if she had to practice a lot. 'In the winter, I snowboard every day from 8:30 am to 4 pm. I also like to run and bike. But I love it all! I enjoy competing and being in the mountains. It's beautiful. Free-riding, which is when you're not competing, is the best part for me.'

We asked what's important when learning. 'You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to wear the right clothes so you don't get wet. When you're starting out, you'll fall a lot, so it's good to be prepared.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text for a C1 learner:

* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary to make the text easier to understand

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. People of all ages have climbed it, from a young boy to an older man. There are several routes to the top. The most popular one is the Marangu path, which is about 5 kilometers long and takes around 5 days to complete. Many tourists choose this path because it's considered easy. However, only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro actually reach the top. This is often due to sudden changes in the weather. At the beginning, it can be hot and rainy, but at the top, climbers may find ice and snow, and the temperature can drop below 20°C. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothing to be prepared.

I made the following changes to simplify the text for a C1 learner:

* Broke up long sentences into shorter, simpler ones
* Changed complex vocabulary (e.g. ""seven-year-old boy"" to ""young boy"")

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

'Otters are rarely seen by humans. These semi-aquatic mammals live near rivers and build their homes using small wooden materials. They are most active at night. Otters are excellent swimmers, capable of reaching speeds of over 10 kilometres per hour in the water. Their thick brown fur helps keep them warm, while their ability to close their ears and nose allows them to stay underwater for several minutes. In the past, there were very few otters in Great Britain due to the poor water quality, which led to a lack of food for them. However, thanks to improved water quality, there is now an abundance of food available for them.'<|eot_id|>"

Hotels in the city centre can be quite pricey. But I have some good news! I talked to my aunt Gloria about you, and she said you're welcome to stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than mine, which should be perfect for you and your friends. Would that work for you?

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

""Building structures have been a part of human life for centuries. We need buildings to provide shelter, warmth, and protection from the elements. We also build stadiums for sports and entertainment events, such as football matches and concerts. Additionally, we use buildings like museums to preserve and showcase valuable cultural and artistic treasures. The construction of a building typically involves collaboration among many people. The architect designs the building's appearance and creates visual representations of their ideas. Engineers ensure the structure is safe and durable. Skilled workers then carefully bring the design to life. The Sydney Opera House is a renowned example of modern architecture, with its striking roof. What's notable is that the building's beauty is not limited to its roof; it's aesthetically pleasing from every angle. Similarly, the Olympic Stadium in Munich features a distinctive glass-roofed structure that resembles a tent. This unique building is a fascinating example of innovative design.""

'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers invented the first hot air balloon, allowing people to fly for the first time. A century later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and took to the skies. This was a significant achievement in the United States. The US Post Office then launched the world's first airmail service in 1918.

Over the next few decades, airplanes underwent significant changes. In the 1950s, the introduction of jet engines made them much faster. This led to the development of supersonic planes, such as Concorde, which was built in the UK and France in 1976. Concorde is the fastest commercial airliner in the world, capable of reaching speeds of 2,500 km/h. This means that a journey from London to New York can take just four hours. Today, millions of people travel by air, and it's hard to imagine a world without airplanes.'
