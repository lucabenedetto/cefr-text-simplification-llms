Charging families for their trash might seem like a good idea. It could help reduce waste and make people think twice about throwing things away. But it's not that simple.
In many countries, people don't pay for their trash collection. Instead, they pay taxes and the government takes care of it. But this means that people don't think about the cost of throwing things away. They just throw it away without thinking.
Some cities have started charging people for their trash. They give out special stickers or tags for people to put on their trash bags. Only bags with the stickers are picked up. This might seem like a good idea, but it's not always effective.
In one city, people were charged 80 cents per bag. This seemed like a good way to make people reduce their waste. But what happened was that people started putting more trash in each bag. They would jump on the bags to squish them down and fit more in. This didn't help the environment at all.
Some people also started dumping their trash illegally instead of paying the fee. This is a big problem because it's hard to measure and clean up.
The only good thing that happened was that more people started recycling. But this might not have been because of the fee. Some people were already recycling before the fee was introduced.
In the end, charging people for their trash might not be the best way to reduce waste. It's a complex problem that needs to be studied and thought about carefully.

Work and Life
Theodore Zeldin thinks about how our work lives could change. Are you happy and respected at your job? It's not enough to be good at your job anymore. Many people feel that their work is not valued or understood, even if they are very good at it. Some people who are very successful feel unhappy and bitter.
In the past, loving your work was enough to make you happy. But now, people need to think about how their job affects them as a person, their relationships, and their mind. This is important. If your job makes you boring and you can't talk to people outside your job, it's not worth it, no matter how much money you make.
Theodore Zeldin wants to find ways to make work more fulfilling. He thinks work should be a way to make us happy and fulfilled, not just a way to make money. He believes that work should be a way to discover new things about ourselves and connect with others.
But it's not just about making money. Many people are unhappy with their jobs, even if they are well-educated. Doctors, accountants, and architects often feel stressed and unhappy. Even people who are successful and well-respected feel trapped in their jobs.
Theodore Zeldin is looking at different jobs and how they affect people. He wants to know how to make work more enjoyable and fulfilling. He believes that work should be a way to be creative, to learn, and to connect with others.
For example, hotel workers are often underpaid and overworked. But hotels could be more than just a place to sleep. They could be a place where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could be given more responsibility and autonomy, and hoteliers could use their skills to create a more welcoming and interesting place.
Theodore Zeldin believes that work is a relationship. He thinks that people should be able to design their own jobs and choose their own colleagues and customers. This would require people to be able to communicate effectively and understand each other's perspectives.
In the end, Theodore Zeldin wants to find ways to make work more enjoyable and fulfilling. He believes that work should be a way to be happy and fulfilled, not just a way to make a living."

'Broadcasting: How Technology Was Shaped by Society
The word ""broadcasting"" originally meant scattering seeds widely. This is not just an agricultural metaphor, but also a symbol of modern optimism. It's about planned growth in many places, creating a rich harvest. The idea of broadcasting assumes a central location with resources to spread and reproduce. The question is why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem suitable.
Television, as a technology, is related to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone. It's surprising that it was designed as a centralized ""mass"" medium from the beginning. However, sending signals to private homes from a central location fit with the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were alternative forms of organization, but they didn't succeed. In the 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television, but big business and the government didn't support it. Instead, they established standards for TV equipment and channels, which made it difficult for amateur projects to continue.
Television was also seen as a potential competitor to the film industry in the United States. In many countries, including Britain and Germany, people mostly watched TV in public settings, not at home.
The idea of a decentralized, two-way TV system was unlikely to succeed. Manufacturers wanted to sell TV sets to people's homes, and the way society was organized made centralized broadcasting the most suitable option.
As people's living standards improved and they entered a consumer society, they began to expect to have entertainment and cultural experiences at home. This is now happening globally. There is a connection between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting.
Centralized broadcasting was a way for governments to reach citizens efficiently and to create a sense of national unity. The pervasiveness of these processes and interests made centralized broadcasting the natural choice for radio and TV.
This text doesn't mention the positive aspects of broadcasting as a way to promote democracy and equal access to resources. As TV technology changes, the term ""broadcasting"" may become outdated, and this metaphor will be seen as a symbol of a particular phase of social modernization.'"

Sometimes, no matter how many things you have, you still don't feel secure. It's natural to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes we buy too many things. Advertising often tries to make us feel like we need things we don't really need. If we don't have something, we might feel like we're not good enough.
Advertising is everywhere - on billboards, TV, radio, newspapers, and the internet. It encourages us to buy, buy, buy. But have you ever stopped to think about how much it affects us?
Caves are a special part of our natural world that fascinates us. Scientists have studied them for a long time to learn more about their origins, water, and biology. Some people visit caves for fun, and they also help scientists learn more about them.
Weather forecasting used to be done by people who used their senses to predict the weather. Today, we have special tools like satellites and computers that help us predict the weather quickly and accurately. But even with all these tools, human experience is still important. People can still notice things that computers can't, and that helps scientists make better predictions.

'Music and Theatre
I used to think that opera is mainly about theatre. But after working at an opera house, I learned that music is actually the most important part. That's how it should be. I come from a world where theatre is the main focus, where the words and the actor speaking them are the most important. In a musical performance, there will be some people who don't understand music very well. They might feel a bit embarrassed about it. Most people will be impressed by the musicians' skills. A great singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician has spent many years practicing. Going to a concert is like watching a sports game - we know the athletes are doing something special, but we can't do it ourselves. Theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't understand how actors work and aren't amazed by something that looks like something they could do themselves. They might ask the actor how they memorized their lines.
This doesn't mean that theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than concert audiences. In fact, many people are the same. What it means is that theatre audiences and performers connect on a more equal level. The question is, can music learn from theatre about this connection? I think yes. I've seen how a different approach can make the concert experience better. Music is already theatrical, with passion, humor, sadness, and grandeur. But the way music is presented, with strict rules and a big difference between the performers and the audience, can feel too formal. On the other hand, when people applaud between movements or after a difficult piece, it can be insensitive to the whole performance. Is there a solution? Yes, many people are working to get new audiences to concerts and to make music more accessible. I remember a special event where a community opera was performed in a cathedral and then in the town. It was an amazing experience, with the musicians showing off their skills, and many people were changed by it. I wish music could be more like theatre, taking risks and trying new things. Sometimes, using unusual locations can be surprising and exciting. Theatre audiences are used to going to unusual places, and they enjoy it. I think music could do the same.'

I don't like sand when it's just lying on the beach. It gets everywhere and makes a mess. It blows in your face, gets in your food, and can even swallow small things like keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you and is hard to get off. But when you sit on a towel or get into a car, it suddenly falls off. After that, it keeps coming out of your shoes and clothes for days. I don't like sand very much.
People have always wanted to have a safe and secure home. In the past, we used a rope and a beam to lock our doors. Now we have electronic locks that can be opened with a special card. But many people prefer the old way, with a physical key. They like the feeling of being in control and safe.
I was a bit worried about visiting the modern art museum because I don't always understand modern art. I like some of it, like pictures with fur and bright lights. But I don't always know what it's supposed to mean. The new museum tries to help visitors understand the art by giving them information about each piece. This helps me to understand what the artist was trying to say. Now, I can look at the pictures and understand them better.

Adapting novels into films is a process that involves cutting out some parts, making it shorter and more concise. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be helpful. When I worked on a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and description from a scene and still get the same message across. This doesn't mean that the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's just that the way we pay attention to things is different in books and movies.
In books, we need more information to understand what's happening. We need to be reminded of characters' traits and who's speaking. In movies, we can usually figure it out from the context. So, we don't need as much repetition.
Watching movies can be an amazing experience. It can transport us to another world and make us feel like we're a part of it. But when the movie is over, we snap back to reality. We don't feel responsible for the time we spent watching the movie, and we don't take it seriously.
Some people used to think that movies were just entertainment, not a real art form. They thought they were just a way to pass the time, not something serious. But now, many people think of movies as a legitimate art form.
The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing place. There were many small rooms, all looking the same, and it was hard to find your way around. The studio didn't encourage strangers to visit, so most people who worked there knew their way around. The employees were working together to make movies that would bring romance and adventure to people's lives.
Many people want to make movies. There are books and courses to help them learn how. Some people even make successful movies with very little money. Robert Rodriguez made a film called El Mariachi for just $7,000. It was a big success and helped him become a famous director.
In the past, film directors were expected to work their way up and learn from experience. They would start by working behind the scenes and then move on to bigger projects. But now, with the rise of independent filmmaking, people can start making movies right away."

In the past, there were many council houses on the west side of the city. They were all lined up in rows, and they looked old and worn out. In the summer, the air was filled with a strong smell from a factory nearby. People would often complain about the smell. 
I don't remember much about my childhood, but I do remember looking out of a window and seeing the houses getting smaller and smaller as they went away. 
My mother was a small, strict woman who was often angry. I never understood why she was angry, and I couldn't make her happy no matter what I did. She was a solitary person who liked to be alone, even when she was with other people. She had a strong sense of what was proper and would get angry if I didn't follow the rules. 
My mother had a few friends, but they were not very nice. They would talk about boring things like the weather and their aching legs. They didn't like me very much, and I didn't like them either. 
Growing up in West Earlham was a routine. Until I was five, I stayed at home and played on the floor while my mother sat in an armchair. Then, when I was five, I started going to school. The lucky ones had mothers who took them to school on their bikes, but my mother didn't have a bike, so I had to walk with the other children. 
I remember the summer holidays when I got to see the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man who lived next door who told me stories about his adventures at sea. I also went to a charity fair once where I got lemonade and tried to learn about a charity that helped people. But my mother didn't like the charity because she thought the people running it were trying to get money from others. 
My mother didn't like politicians either. She thought they were all corrupt and only cared about money. She didn't have much kindness in her, and I don't think she ever thought about how her behavior affected me. 
Although my mother didn't like me to go to school, she did take me to the museum on Sundays. We would walk hand in hand and look at the paintings. My mother wasn't always happy, but sometimes she would make a joke, like when we saw a painting of a Roman soldier and she said, ""I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"""

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. It was getting dark, and the air was thick with mist. I knew this side of the street from when I was a child. There were familiar houses, including the Matzes', the Pritchards', and Han Kieffer's grocery store. As I walked, the street got lower and the front yards became smaller. Over time, some houses had changed. Wooden porches were replaced with iron ones, and some stores became homes.
In Shillington, many houses I remembered as homes are now stores. Even stores like Han Kieffer's grocery store are now homes. I wonder how people live in these spaces with all the old smells of merchandise.
I visited a friend, Rick Gilbert, who lives in a former curtain warehouse. He wanted a cozy space, not a big open area. So, he put up a big plastic sheet to divide the room. It creates a hallway and hides his office. He wanted a neutral zone for cooking and working.
Bruce Chatwin was a famous writer. He wrote a book called In Patagonia, which is a unique travel book. He mixed fact and fiction to create an exciting story. His writing is like a thriller, romantic fiction, and extraordinary literature all mixed together.
I remember swimming in the pool behind my house on a rainy day. The raindrops exploded on the water, creating bubbles. It was a magical moment. I started thinking about swimming through Britain, following the rain to the sea. I wanted to break free from swimming in circles and explore the world.
Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. But walking, cycling, and swimming allow us to discover the unknown and break free from the official version of things. A swimming journey would give me access to a part of the world that is still mysterious and wild."

Charles Darwin thought that humans crying didn't have a clear reason to exist. He was probably wrong. Later, scientists found that crying is important for building strong relationships between mothers and children. Many people think that crying is a way to show helplessness, especially when we're young. But why do adults still cry? It's not just the sound of crying that matters, but the way it looks. This may have been helpful for early human groups because it helped build trust and connection. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. We can also cry when we hear something sad or moving, like a sad song or a powerful speech. Interestingly, we're more likely to cry when we're with others than when we're alone. It seems that crying is important for social connections, but scientists are still learning more about it.

The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. We know that the Earth is warming, but we're not sure how much warmer it will get or how it will affect our lives. A warmer climate means changes in the weather all over the world. This will have big effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have used the natural resources of the Earth to build cities, grow food, and support a population of six billion people. Any changes to these resources are important. We need to know how the world will change and what is causing these changes.
Scientists have found that human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air, which are related to global temperature. These gases are building up and may already be affecting the climate. But we don't fully understand the Earth's heat balance, so we're not sure what will happen in the future.
Scientists have used computers to predict what will happen if the Earth gets warmer. They use special programs called general circulation models, or GCMs. These programs are like simplified versions of the real world and are not perfect. They can only give us approximate answers and are slow and expensive to use.
Most people agree that the Earth will warm up faster than it has in the past. This will have big effects on the natural environment and human societies. The warmer climate could make some places more suitable for plants and animals, but it could also cause problems like droughts, floods, and heatwaves.
Some areas will be affected more than others. For example, places with dry soil may have less water, and areas with heavy rainfall may have more flooding. The Mediterranean region is already experiencing changes in rainfall patterns.
The melting of glaciers and sea ice could also have big effects. This could cause problems for people who live near the coast, as sea levels rise. About half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, so this could be a big problem. Rising sea levels could cause flooding and damage to homes and cities.
Overall, global warming is a serious issue that will affect many people and the environment. We need to learn more about it and find ways to reduce its effects."

Art and Beauty
It's ironic that the things we use to understand art can actually get in the way of understanding. This is because art is often seen as something separate from our everyday experiences. We tend to focus on the physical objects, like paintings or sculptures, rather than what they do to us and how they make us feel.
This can make it hard to understand art because we're not considering the context in which it was created or how it affects our lives. When we put art on a pedestal, it becomes isolated from the world around us. This can make it seem separate from other human experiences and achievements.
To truly understand art, we need to connect it to our everyday lives. We need to see how art is part of our experiences, just like other things we enjoy, like movies or music. Many people enjoy things they don't think of as ""art"", like watching movies or reading comic strips. This shows that we have an instinct to enjoy things that are beautiful and enjoyable, and this instinct is not limited to what we call ""art"".
In the past, people appreciated art more when it was connected to their daily lives. When art was part of their daily routines, they appreciated it more. So, to understand art, we need to connect it to our everyday experiences and see how it affects us."

Many people think lions are like a well-trained team when they hunt for food. They imagine a group of cats working together to catch their prey. But after studying lions for many years, we have a different opinion. We used to think that lions hunted together because it helped them survive and have more babies. But it seems that this is not always the case. Sometimes, lions are not very good at working together. They can even be lazy and do nothing. It took us a long time to understand their behavior because they can live up to 18 years in the wild.

**Advertising in Trouble**
In the early 1990s, the advertising industry was facing a tough time. The economy was in a bad state, and many businesses were struggling. In the UK, the situation was particularly difficult, with many people losing their jobs and homes being repossessed.
Advertising agencies were also affected, and many people in the industry lost their jobs. Those who were still working felt under a lot of pressure to deliver good results with smaller budgets. They were expected to do more with less, and this was a big challenge.
At the same time, companies were starting to realize the importance of marketing and advertising. They wanted to make sure they were producing products and services that customers wanted, not just what was convenient for them. This meant that marketing and advertising were becoming more important, and companies were willing to invest more in these areas.
However, the recession had also made companies more cautious and skeptical about the value of advertising. They wanted to see clear evidence of the benefits of advertising, and they were not willing to spend money on it unless they could see a clear return on their investment.
As a result, advertising agencies were under a lot of pressure to deliver good results with smaller budgets. They had to be creative and innovative to produce effective advertising campaigns. The industry was also facing other challenges, such as changing consumer habits, the rise of online advertising, and stricter regulations.
Overall, the 1990s were a tough time for the advertising industry, but it also led to a greater focus on the importance of marketing and advertising, and a desire to deliver better results with smaller budgets."

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. My friends thought it was an unusual choice because cooking wasn't a popular job at that time. Chefs have a hard life: they work long hours, under pressure, and don't get paid well. But I didn't let that stop me. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard and the social scene was snobbish. Being a chef seemed like a great way to escape all that. It promised a sense of purpose and honesty that I didn't find in my college life.
I wasn't just interested in cooking because I was unhappy at university. I also loved the idea of creating something beautiful and delicious. My first experience of this was when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing. I still remember my starter. After that, I wanted to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my focus from studying to learning about cooking. I read cookbooks, visited markets and delicatessens, and cooked big meals.
The school's swimming instructor was a former army sergeant. He taught me how to dive by telling me to sit on the pool edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced until the lesson was over. The next time, he made me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict and always told me what to do: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight!"" ""Point your toes!"" The next week, I went to the high board. It was high and I was scared. But when I jumped, I felt like I was flying. When I got out of the water, the instructor was disappointed with me, but I felt happy and free.
The idea of traveling is strange to some people. They think it's crazy to take risks and go to unknown places. But some people love the adventure and the thrill of the unknown. They might climb a high mountain, sail a small boat, or eat strange foods. We can't understand why they do it, but it's their choice. We can stay in our comfortable lives and be happy with what we have.

Fashion is often thought to be a modern idea that started with capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, historians of fashion say that fashion, in the sense of style and design, has a long history. They look at the rise of trade and markets in the 16th and 17th centuries as the start of fashion. As societies get more complex, people wear more clothes and use more things to decorate themselves, and the meanings of these things change. It's hard to know exactly what something means, like a man's suit, because it can mean different things to different people in different situations.
As a writer, I know that people often think that famous authors have an easy life. But the truth is, many writers have to work other jobs to make a living.

Music in the Future
Technology is changing the way we live, work, and have fun. Susan Hallam talks about how it's affecting music in Britain. In the past, we had more ways to listen to music, like the radio, TV, records, and CDs. But this has led to fewer people playing live music and fewer jobs for professional musicians.
Music is important for many people. We use it in big events and in our daily lives. It's hard to imagine a world without music. The question is, what will music be like in the future? Will people still want to learn to play instruments?
I think people will still want to learn to play instruments. Music is a big part of the entertainment industry, and musicians are important in many professions. Research shows that playing an instrument can also help children develop important skills, like spatial reasoning and concentration.
In the short term, there will still be a demand for music lessons. But in the long term, music might change. People might listen to different types of music and use technology to create and perform music. This could make it easier for people to make music, but it might also mean fewer jobs for musicians who only perform live.
To prepare for the future, music teachers will need to change how they teach. They will need to find ways to teach people of all ages to play different instruments. This will require them to be able to motivate and inspire students, work with large groups, and develop important skills like communication and leadership.
It's also important for the music profession to work together to promote music and show that it's a valuable part of our lives. Music is important, but we often take it for granted. By working together, we can make sure music remains an important part of our lives."

Actors often get criticized, and sometimes they even talk about themselves in interviews. But they should remember what the famous dancer Pavlova said: ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, they often say boring things or talk about gossip. The actor Paul Scofield said that an actor's work only comes alive when they perform it, not when they talk about it.
A recent performance of Hamlet, starring Adrian Lester, was amazing. He played the role of a young man who is struggling to find his place in the world. He used his body and voice to bring the character to life. The performance was simple, yet powerful.
So, what is acting? Is it just imitating someone else, or is it bringing the character to life? Who or what makes the actor's body move? These are important questions about the life of the theatre.
One director's approach to rehearsal is called ""dropping in"". The actors sit quietly while someone else speaks, and then they think about what the words mean to them. They wait for the impulse to speak, and then they speak. This helps them find the right emotions and feelings for their character.
The perfect theatre should make you feel like you're a part of the performance. The staff should be enthusiastic and welcoming, and the auditorium should be designed to make you feel connected to the actors on stage. The proportions of the auditorium are important - it should be big enough to fit the human body, but not so big that it feels empty.
Not every play can be liked by everyone, and that's okay. The theatre should be a place where you can experience something new and unexpected."

Rock and roll music in the 1950s was mainly popular among young people, but it also had a big impact on older people and the middle class. It paved the way for new rock stars and influenced the next generation of musicians. For Paul Simon, listening to rock and roll music was a big part of his life. He listened to a popular radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, which was hosted by Alan Freed. This show was very popular among young people who loved rock and roll music.
Paul Simon was fascinated by the music on the show and wanted to make his own music. He didn't know what the future held, but he was determined to follow his dreams. He took small steps towards his goal, and eventually, he started making his own music.

The authors of this text invited experts in the field to share their experiences and approaches to data analysis. They wanted to make the process more clear and understandable for others.

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur!"" He was pretending to be a character from a TV show. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, and he didn't know much. Some people think that learning with a computer or phone is a good way to learn, but is it really? One writer tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought his son might have learned something if he had read a book instead.
Television is a way to learn, but it's not the same as learning with a teacher or parent. We need to use technology to help our children learn, but we also need to teach them in a classroom.

Photography is a way to take pictures. A long time ago, artists used it as a new way to create art. Some people didn't think it was art because it was made with machines. But photographers knew they had found a new way to express themselves.
In the past, books for children often had pictures. This was important because it helped children understand the story. Some of these pictures are still valuable today and can be found in museums or exhibitions.

Some time ago, a website warned people about sharing their whereabouts on the internet. The website said that by sharing your location, you are also sharing it with people you might not want to meet. This made people realize that sharing too much online can have negative consequences.
The internet has given us many opportunities to share our lives with others. We can share photos, stories, and even our thoughts. But sometimes we realize too late that the internet is a big and scary place, and we can get lost.
There are people who have been sharing their lives online for a long time. They are called bloggers. They started sharing their thoughts and experiences on the internet many years ago. They have already experienced the good and the bad sides of sharing their lives online.
One of the first bloggers was a young man named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life online in 1994. He shared photos, art, and his thoughts. He even shared his personal life, including his relationships. But one day, he had to take down his blog because it caused problems in his personal life.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, also shared her life online. She wrote about her job and her personal life. But one day, her colleagues found out about her blog and she lost her job. This is called the ""online distribution effect."" It means that what we say online can affect our real lives.
Heather Armstrong learned an important lesson. She realized that just because we can share anything online, it doesn't mean we should. She started sharing her life online again, but this time she was more careful. She focused on sharing positive things and building a community around her blog.
The story of these bloggers teaches us that sharing our lives online can be risky. But if we are careful and responsible, we can use the internet to build a positive and supportive community."

Tiredness is a common problem in many countries. People are getting less sleep and feeling more anxious. In the USA, 40 million people have a hard time sleeping. Some books and movies are even featuring characters who can't sleep. People are interested in sleep because they want to know why they need it.
A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they started sleeping for 8 hours a night again. This shows that people need a lot of sleep.
There is a university laboratory in England that studies sleep. They want to know how fatigue affects people, like sailors and drivers. They also want to know how noise from airplanes affects people's sleep. They ask students to participate in the study and pay them £5 an hour.
The laboratory has a special machine that simulates a motorway. They ask people to drive while answering questions. The machine makes it look like they are driving on a real road. The people in the study think they are going to fall asleep, but they don't want to.
The researchers found that people can drive safely after drinking two cups of coffee. They also found that some people need more sleep than others. Women sleep for half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep.
Scientists are still not sure what sleep is for. Some think it helps our bodies repair themselves, while others think it just helps us relax. But one thing is certain: people need sleep.
In the past, people used to sleep differently. They would go to bed early and wake up after midnight. They would then stay awake for an hour before going back to sleep. This was a good time for them to think and relax. But with the invention of artificial light, people started sleeping more solidly at night. Today, people all over the world are struggling to get enough sleep."

I wore my expensive cowboy boots and a cowboy outfit to the Arizona desert. I thought I looked like a real cowboy, but I wasn't one. I felt out of place among the real cowboys at the airport. I used to be a racing driver, but I don't do it anymore. I loved racing, but I don't know what to do now. I thought I had a plan, but it didn't work out. I tried to be a TV commentator, but there were too many other ex-racing drivers doing the job. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but nobody was buying.
I'm now an ""ex"" racing driver, which is hard work. Nobody wants to hear about my racing stories because they don't end well. I miss racing, though. I miss the thrill of driving a fast car and the attention I got from people. Now, I have a lot of free time and nothing to do. I looked up at the sky and saw some birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to get away before they start singing. It surprised me that the desert had songbirds. I realized that I, a fake cowboy in expensive boots, had a lot to learn.

Vancouver is a city in western Canada that has become very popular over the past ten years. Many people from all over the world have moved there. The city has a mild climate, beautiful scenery, and a safe environment. It's also a great place to find a job and get an education. People like living in Vancouver because it's a nice place to be.
The city used to be called ""Terminal City"" because it was a place where people would stop before going to other places. Now, it's still a gateway to other places, but it's also a popular place to live.

""Citizen Kane"" is a famous film made by Orson Welles in 1941. It was a big deal when it came out, but it didn't do very well at the box office. It wasn't until it was shown on television that people started talking about it again. This film is special because it made many people want to become film directors. It's surprising because it was Welles's first film.
Welles worked with a great team, including a cameraman, a screenwriter, and a special effects expert. They came up with the idea of making a film about a newspaper owner who was like William Randolph Hearst. Welles thought this was the perfect project for him to direct and act in. He had a lot of energy and enthusiasm for the project.
The story is about a man who is a newspaper owner. He is very important and has a lot of power. He is also very selfish and doesn't care about anyone else. His wife, Carmel, is worried about him because he is always saying he might be late and not come home for dinner. She asks him what he will do that day and he says he will go to the town and look at the shops.
Now, let's talk about job titles. A recent study found that job titles can cause problems at work. Most employers and employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Shockingly, 70% of office workers would rather have a better job title than a pay rise. This shows that people are very concerned about how they are perceived at work. The truth is that people want to be important and have a good reputation.

I was in Vienna to take pictures. I love taking pictures. They are not just my job, but a part of my life. I enjoy looking at how light falls on things. I believe that one picture can capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I was in Vienna to take pictures for a project about four European cities - London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had done the pictures for London, and now it was Vienna's turn.
I arrived in Vienna and was put up at a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was hot and busy, and I didn't take many pictures. This time, I was on my own, and I was excited to explore the city and take some great photos.
The first day, I just walked around the city and got a feel for the place. The weather was cold and grey, and the city was quiet. I didn't take any pictures that day. I just wanted to enjoy the atmosphere and let the city reveal itself to me.
The next morning, I went out early to take some pictures. The snow had fallen overnight, and the city was covered in a layer of white. I wanted to take a picture of the cathedral, but it was big and complicated. I decided to take a partial picture instead. It was still magical, and I loved the way the light fell on the snow.
Taking pictures is special. It's like magic. You can watch a blank sheet of paper become a picture in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, it still feels mysterious. That's why I love taking pictures."

The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a magical place. It's not because of a big and flashy show, but because of a special exhibition about a type of art that moves or is about movement. This art is called kinetic art. The exhibition shows many different paintings, drawings, and films that show how artists have used movement in their work over the past 60 years. The curator, Guy Brett, has spent his life studying this type of art. He didn't add many explanations, so visitors can discover and connect the artworks on their own.
Some people like the artist David Hockney because his paintings are easy to understand and look like real life. They might not be interested in art, but they like Hockney's personality and what he says in the newspapers. Some critics think Hockney is not a very good artist, but he knows his own limitations and doesn't try to be something he's not.
As a curator, I have seen many art exhibitions. Sometimes they are very good, but sometimes they try to tell us what to think or feel. I wanted to create an exhibition that just shows different artworks together, without a specific theme. The artists I worked with made some interesting and unusual pieces, like a train track with knitted cats or a broken video camera. They didn't fit together, but they worked well together.
Some people don't like to analyze paintings because it ruins the pleasure of looking at them. But knowing more about the art can actually make it more enjoyable. Pleasure is not just about liking something, it's also about understanding why we like it. Our tastes are influenced by the society we live in.

Metals
A long time ago, people might have started using metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. One day, someone might have found a shiny yellow stone in a river and picked it up. It felt different from regular stones, so they might have thought it was special. This could be how people first found gold. Because metals are easy to shape, people soon wanted more of them. They might have also found copper by accident, and when they realized how useful it was, they started looking for more and finding ways to get it out of the ground. This is how people started making metal things.
St Ives
We walked down a small, cobblestone street in St Ives, trying to avoid the strong wind and the icy water that was splashing over the wall. The streets were empty, and all the shutters on the houses were closed tight. We had taken the train to St Ives and watched the weather get worse as we arrived. We had planned to walk along the beautiful coast and enjoy cozy evenings by the fire. Computer Modelling
The problem with studying the past is that it's already happened. The people who lived a long time ago are dead, and we can't ask them questions. We can't even test our ideas by trying them out with people who lived a long time ago. But we can use computers to create a virtual world that is like the past. We can make digital people who have some of the same needs and abilities as real people. We can make rules for them to follow and see how they behave in different situations. We can even change the weather or the number of people in the virtual world and see how they react.

One day, a dominant male monkey noticed a strange male in a nearby group of trees. The stranger was trying to join the group, but the dominant male didn't want to lose his position. So, he came up with a clever plan. When the stranger tried to cross the open ground to join the group, the dominant male made a loud noise like a leopard was coming. The stranger quickly went back to the safety of the trees. This happened several times, and the stranger eventually got tired of being tricked.
Cats
In a small English village, people collected their cats' prey over a year. They caught over 1,000 animals. A professor calculated that if all cats in Britain did the same, they would catch 100 million animals a year. However, most cats are in towns and don't catch as many animals as the cats in the village. The important question is whether the number of animals caught is sustainable. The answer is yes, because many people feed birds and provide nesting sites, so the bird population is higher than usual. The cats are a predator, but they are not harming the bird population.

Buffaloes are very important to the people who live near them. They wake up slowly and go to the reed beds, where they spend the day grazing. They move slowly and make low sounds of complaint. They may look like they are swimming, but they are actually grazing underwater.

Photography has been used to capture human life and activities for over 150 years. During this time, photography has improved its ability to record moments and show both big and small things. It has given us pictures from all around the world, from the solar system, and from daily life. Photography has also helped us understand and express human feelings.
People have been creating pictures for a long time. The earliest pictures were made about 35,000 years ago. These early pictures may have been used to record events, to help people hunt, or to decorate homes. Pictures are important to human culture.
When photography was invented, it changed the way we see the world. People thought it was a truthful way to show reality. They believed that if they took a picture, it would be a true representation of what they saw. The camera was like a machine that could capture what we see with our eyes.
Photography was also seen as a way to show people things they might not have seen before. For example, in the 1930s, a photographer named August Sander said that even people from remote areas could understand pictures of the sun, moon, and stars. However, with more global communication today, we need to think about how people from different cultures understand pictures.
Photography is often seen as a way to show the truth, but it can also be influenced by cultural norms. Sometimes, people take pictures for granted and forget that they are a way to communicate. Photography can be used to show important events and make people think about social and political issues.
For example, photography played a big role in the Italian Renaissance and helped change the way people saw the world. Similarly, photography has contributed to the media culture we have today and has shown us the harsh realities of the world.

**How to Write Poetry and Other Forms of Writing**
Writing is like playing a game where you need to be careful not to make mistakes. When you start writing, it's important to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination run free. Some people need a stable life before they can write, while others can write even when they're going through a tough time.
When writing a short story, you need to be careful not to include too many characters, too much detail, or too many memories from the past. Instead, use flashbacks to help explain what's happening in the story. Dialogue can be a great way to show two sides of an argument and keep the reader interested.
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. You need to think ahead and plan your moves carefully. You don't need to know everything at the beginning, but you need to be willing to learn and improve as you go along.
**Why Writing is Hard**
Writing is not like speaking, which comes naturally to us. We learn to write by practicing and learning the rules. Children can learn to speak without lessons, but they need to be taught how to read and write. Writing is a skill that takes time and effort to develop.
In this text, I have kept the main ideas and examples, but simplified the language and sentence structure to make it more accessible to a B1 learner. I have also removed some of the more complex vocabulary and concepts to make it easier to understand."

I'm not sure if I should call this a novel. It's not a typical story with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it's a collection of memories about a person I knew, but not very well. I don't know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could have made things up to fill in the gaps, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write what I know.
I've changed the names of the people in the story to protect their privacy. The person I'm writing about is not famous, and he might not be remembered after he dies. If that's the case, my book will only be interesting because of its own worth. But maybe his way of living and his kind heart will have a lasting impact on the people around him, and people will want to know more about him.
I've written down conversations we had, but I didn't take notes. I have a good memory, so I think what I wrote is accurate. Sometimes, I've put words in people's mouths that I didn't actually hear. This is because I want to make the story more interesting and believable. You can tell when I've done this, and you can choose to ignore it.
I'm a bit nervous about writing about people from a different culture. It's hard to really know someone from a different background. People are shaped by their upbringing, their family, their friends, and their experiences. You can't know these things just by hearing about them; you have to live them. That's why it's hard to write about people from a different culture. I've never tried to write about people from a different culture before, and it's a bit of a challenge for me."

Poetry is a confusing and complex art form, and it's hard to understand what's important at the moment. In the past, people looked back and saw a clear pattern of good and bad poetry, but today it's hard to make sense of it. There are many different types of poetry being written, and people have different opinions about what makes good poetry. Some poets write for the page, while others perform their poetry in front of an audience.
There is a debate between these two groups. The poets who write for the page think that the poets who perform in front of an audience are not as good. They think that the performing poets are only in it for the applause and don't care about the quality of their work. The performing poets, on the other hand, think that the page-bound poets are too serious and don't know how to connect with people.
Despite this debate, poetry readings have become more popular over the past 20 years. Small groups of people get together to hear poets read their work, and schools and colleges invite poets to talk to their students. Some festivals also feature poetry readings.
The consequences of all these poetry readings are not clear. For some poets, it's a good thing because they can make money and get famous. For others, it's not so good because they might be forced to write simpler poetry that is easy to understand, but not as good.
It's important to remember that poetry is meant to be read on the page, not just heard. When you hear a poet read their work, it's helpful to have the text in front of you, so you can see the words and understand them better. Poetry readings can be enjoyable and educational, but they shouldn't replace reading poetry on the page. The main reason for poetry readings is to make people enjoy poetry and not think it's only for a select group of people."

**Oral History**
When historians ask people about the past, they must be careful. The person telling the story might not remember everything correctly because of the way they are asked the questions. The historian also influences what the person says by choosing who they talk to and what questions they ask. Even if the historian doesn't ask questions, just being there can affect what the person remembers.
The person telling the story might also remember things that they learned from others, like the media. They might also remember things because they feel a certain way about the past, like nostalgia or sadness.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: physiology and whole animal. Physiologists look at how animals' bodies work, like how their nerves and muscles work together. Those who study whole animals look at how they behave and what affects their behavior.
Some scientists study how animals learn, like rats and pigeons, while others study how animals behave in their natural habitats. Both ways are important, and they can help us understand animals better.
**Social Sciences**
When you start studying a social science, you need to learn two things at once: the subject matter and the way it is studied. Social sciences are not just common sense; they have their own special methods and ideas.
Each social science focuses on a specific part of society and uses its own way of studying and thinking. This is what makes each discipline different from others.
**Classical Architecture**
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was not just about building houses. It was about creating beautiful and harmonious buildings. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution.
The origins of classical architecture are complex, but it is based on a long history of simple construction and design. Even the simplest huts contributed to the development of more sophisticated architectural ideas.

Lily's sisters kept her secret from her brother-in-law, Chen, for a while. She would drive around the town, practicing on quiet roads and bridges. Chen was actually amused when he found out what Lily had been doing. 'You can really drive!' he said, impressed. 'Well done!' Lily and Chen started making plans for a trip together. They decided to go on a Monday, when the town was less busy. They would leave early in the morning and come back by lunchtime. Lily would practice driving around the town before they left. Mui, Lily's sister, was a bit worried, but she decided to support Lily. She even bought a road map to help them navigate.
On the day of the trip, Lily drove perfectly. Mui was surprised and impressed. Chen was proud of Lily too. They drove along the coast, past the gasworks and the lagoon, and parked in a quiet street near the sea. Lily was a bit worried about parking, but she was careful and paid for a parking spot. After their trip, Chen joked that the van was not very nice, but Lily and Mui didn't like that. Chen then took his son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. Man Kee was fascinated by the waves and the ships. Chen saw a ship in the distance and used a telescope to take a closer look. He told Man Kee that the ship would take them back home one day. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily saw the ship disappear over the horizon."

You watched as I pulled up the bucket, steadied it, and then climbed down into the well. I told you to let me down, but I didn't think about the weight of the bucket or your strength. You held the handle, and I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange, blurry lights. Later, I realized that it was like the stars I saw in cartoons when a character gets hit.
At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what my parents would say. You called out to me, and I tried to answer, but you called again, sounding worried. I stayed still, watching you through my eyelashes. You left and called for help. I waited, then climbed back up and jumped out of the well. I landed on the courtyard stones and heard people coming from the castle door. I ran the other way and hid in the shadows.
My mother and father came with you and Arthur. My mother was hysterical, flapping her hands. My father shouted and told Arthur to pull up the bucket. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows, feeling proud of myself. Then I saw the spots of water on the stones where I had fallen. I looked back at the well and saw my father shining a light into it. The drops I had left were shining in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one had seen them.
My mother was screaming loudly, and I felt guilty. What was I to do? I had gotten revenge on you, but now things were serious. I had made a big mistake. I thought about it like a lifebelt to a drowning person. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding. I cried out weakly, then louder, and stumbled forward. I fell down, then sat up, holding my head. My mother comforted me, and I said I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I crawled and swam through it and got out, climbed the bridge, and walked to the passageway. I was almost getting away with it, but then my father appeared in front of me. He made me tell my story again. I did, hesitating. He looked at me suspiciously. I said the secret passage had fallen in, and it was too dangerous to send someone down. He looked at me like he was seeing me for the first time. His words were like a dark tunnel with no stars at the end. He walked away, and Arthur looked at me with regret and worry.

'Online Book Reviews: A New Way to Share Opinions
The idea of the internet was to make it easy for anyone to share their thoughts and ideas. In the early days, it was difficult to publish a book or music online, but writing a book review was easy. Amazon, a popular online bookstore, made it simple for anyone to share their opinion about a book. They allowed readers to write reviews and rate books with up to five stars.
This idea seemed brilliant, as it gave readers a chance to see what others thought about a book before buying it. Other online bookstores did the same. Amazon, being the biggest, had the most reviews and the most problems. With so many reviews, it was hard to keep track of them all. Amazon's team checked the reviews to make sure they followed the rules. They didn't allow one-word reviews, personal attacks, or reviews that gave away the ending.
However, since reviewers were anonymous, it was easy to write fake reviews. Some authors even wrote fake reviews to help their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was unhappy with the bad reviews of his book and wrote some fake good reviews. He got caught and the fake reviews were removed.
Amazon also allowed authors to write comments on their own books. Most authors wrote nice messages, but some gave their email addresses so readers could contact them. However, anyone could write a comment, so it was hard to know if it was really from the author.
Some authors tried to post fake comments, but Amazon removed them. The real problem was with readers' reviews. When a book was popular, some people wrote bad reviews just to be mean. Amazon removed these reviews, but it was hard to keep track of them all.
Despite the problems, most readers took their reviews seriously. They wrote thoughtful comments and helped others decide whether or not to buy a book. In the end, the democratization of book reviews was a good thing.'

Art is often seen as something new and special. People praise artists who do something different and exciting. But when we look at art from our own time, we often don't like it as much. We expect art to be surprising and new, so we don't notice the old ideas and techniques that are still used. We want artists to be special and talented, and we expect them to do something that no one else has done before.
Let me tell you a story. An artist chooses a text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures. The artist then asks someone else to paint a canvas with the text on it. The artist wants the text to be written in simple black letters on a white canvas. My question is: is this a painting?
In the art world, it's common for artists to stick to what they're good at. People like to buy art from artists who make the same kind of art over and over again. But some artists try to do something new and different. Eric Rimmington is an artist who is doing something new. He used to paint still-life paintings, but now he's painting pictures of the London Underground.
I'm going to tell you a story from a book. A man has escaped to a small island to be alone. He's not happy or unhappy; he's just thinking about his memories. He talks about how art can help us make sense of the world. He says that art can help us find the meaning in our lives, even when things are difficult.

Simon Costello realized that buying a house in Pembroke Square was a mistake after just one year of living there. The house was too expensive, and they had to be very careful with their money. At the time, it seemed like a good idea, though. Simon had been having a lot of success with his cases, and his wife Lois was working again after having twins. She had even gotten a promotion and was earning £35,000 a year.
Lois had wanted to move to a bigger house with a garden and a separate room for their au pair. Simon didn't object too much because he thought it would be a good idea. They could have found a similar place in a less expensive part of London, but Lois wanted something better. She wanted a house in a nice area where they could show off their success.
Simon's daily commute to work was long and tiring. He would often think about his childhood and his grandparents' house in Hampstead, where he felt happy and relaxed. His grandmother used to make sure his grandfather, a lawyer, had a peaceful evening after a long day in court.
Simon's wife Lois believed that her career was just as important as his. They both worked hard and relied on each other's income. But now, their happiness was threatened by Venetia, a woman who was angry and upset. Simon remembered their conversation and felt guilty. Venetia had accused him of not doing something right in a case four years ago. Simon denied it, but Venetia didn't believe him. He wished he had said something different, but it was too late now.
Venetia was a lawyer who had defended someone Simon had defended years ago. She was angry because Simon had not done something he should have done in that case. Simon didn't know what Venetia would do next, but he was worried that it could damage his reputation and his career."

I chose to live in this place because I thought it would be easy to be anonymous. I wouldn't have to worry about the state of the house or the garden. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon recognize me. Even the garden next door, which was once well-loved, reminds me that I'm not alone. Tonight, I'm sitting in my small garden, surrounded by plants that have grown tall and sprawling to survive. I've been clearing some space and my arms and hands are covered in scratches and stings.
My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window and sees me. She's an author and I sometimes help her with her writing. ""I've been doing some clearing too,"" she says. I don't want her in my garden, so I try to ignore her. But she comes over anyway.
Jaz is always talking about her writing, and I'm not very interested. She says she's not going on holiday, unlike me. I'm actually going to visit my friend Ruby at her pub. Jaz is curious about my plans, but I'm not very good at talking about my personal life.
Jaz asks me what I think of her latest book, and I tell her I like the title. But then I give her some advice: she should write about nicer people who try to be good. She gets defensive and says I'm being too critical. I tell her I keep a journal to write about the good things in my day, and she laughs at me.
I go back inside and feel a bit better in my calm kitchen. But then I remember my old school teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to wink at us and say she'd had her moments. It's a strange feeling, but it makes me think about my own life.

Heritage is important because it helps us feel connected to our past. We often know about our family's history and the stories of our grandparents. But it's also important to learn about the past of our country and community. This helps us understand our present and future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity and identity.
In the past, people passed down stories and legends from one generation to another. But with the change in society, this tradition has been lost. Now, we can learn about our past by visiting places and looking at old buildings.
I wrote a book called Waterland, which is set in a place called the Fens in England. The Fens are a special place that is both familiar and strange. It's a place where people can feel a sense of connection to the past.
Museums are important because they help us learn about our past. They should make their collections accessible to everyone, not just experts. They should use displays and exhibitions to make the past come alive and interesting.
Preserving our environment is also important. As our towns change, we need to think about what we want to keep and what we want to change. We need to balance preservation with progress.

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for a B1 level learner:
Einstein is a famous scientist. Many people know his name, but not much about what he did. He came up with some big ideas about the universe and time. These ideas were new and different from what people thought before. Einstein showed that time and space are not fixed, but can change depending on how fast you move and where you are. This was a big change in how people thought about the universe.
In the past, scientists like Isaac Newton thought that the universe was like a big machine with fixed rules. Einstein changed that idea. He said that time and space are connected and can be affected by how fast you move and where you are.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a B1 level learner:
Writing Reviews
Frank Kermode, a well-known writer, talks about the job of writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and have a short lifespan. They are often limited to a specific length and are only published for a short time. Some people think that writing reviews is not a valuable use of time, but Kermode believes that it is a skilled job that requires a lot of knowledge and writing ability.
A good reviewer needs to consider the audience and write in a way that is easy to understand. They also need to be able to write about many different things and use clear language. Not everyone can do this job well, but some people, like authors, enjoy writing reviews in their free time.
Kermode himself is an academic, which means he writes about serious books and articles. He believes that it is common for academics to write reviews, and that it is a good thing because it helps readers know what the book is about and it keeps academics from getting too caught up in their own work. He also thinks that writing reviews helps academics remember to write clearly and simply, so that non-academics can understand their work.
In the end, Kermode thinks that writing reviews is not the main job of a reviewer, but rather something they do in addition to their main work."

Ralph returned to his flat after work and felt a familiar feeling of ownership. He had bought the flat three years ago and still sometimes felt a little uncertain when he came home alone. When he first moved in, he used to come home early, eager to see what had happened during the day. The flat was his own space, where he could relax and be himself.
Ralph used to worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat had always been waiting for him, looking a bit messy or tidy depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to think of it as an extension of himself, a place where he could be alone and think.
When he came home, he would sometimes find letters and messages on the floor and the answering machine would be blinking. He was grateful that nothing was broken or damaged. Ralph looked forward to his evenings at home, away from the office and the people he worked with.
At the office, he felt like he was pretending to be someone else. He longed for time alone, but when he got home, he felt empty and unsure of himself. He would read or listen to music, but even those things didn't feel the same. He felt lost and unsure of what he wanted.
Ralph used to have big plans for his life, but after university, he just wanted to survive. He took a job at a local newspaper, not really thinking about whether it was the right fit. The boss, Neil, offered him the job on the spot, and Ralph took it, thinking it was a compliment.

Goat Racing
I was going to watch goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. The streets were crowded with people, food stalls, and music. I had to push my way through the crowd to get a good spot. The racing area was set up, but it wasn't like a big racing track. The goats were trying to stay in line, but they like to eat almost anything they can find.
Canoe Trip
As the day ended, I thought about the night ahead and got scared. Our canoe was wet and we didn't have a place to sleep. We hadn't seen any villages or houses since morning. We used our torches to see the cliffs, but the batteries were running out. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. Later, Lesley saw a light in the distance and we thought we might find a place to rest. But it was just the moon shining on the water. We heard the sound of rushing water, but we couldn't see what was happening. We kept moving.
How to be a Good Presenter
I'm not good at making presentations, but as a manager, I have to do it more often. I want to improve my skills and be more confident. Many executives are expected to be good at presenting, but it's different from running a company. To convince others, you have to be convinced yourself. Show your passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. Make sure you're prepared and practice your presentation. Ask colleagues to help you prepare by asking them what questions they might ask. Start your presentation by finding something you both agree on and build up to your conclusion.

There are some things that cannot be rushed. You can hurry to a meeting, but if you add oil to mayonnaise too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get even more tangled. Our minds work at different speeds too. Some things happen quickly, while others take time. We can get better at solving puzzles or doing math quickly, but some things cannot be rushed. If we try to rush them, they will break or get tangled.
We learn, think, and know in different ways. Some things need to be done quickly, while others need to be thought about slowly. Our minds have three different speeds. One is very fast, like when we react to a sudden situation. Another is slower, like when we think about a problem. The third is the slowest, like when we are daydreaming or relaxing.
We need all three speeds to be smart. We need to be able to react quickly, think carefully, and daydream slowly. Sometimes, we need to take our time to think about a problem. This is especially true for things that are complex or hard to understand. Scientists are studying how our minds work and are finding that the slow, quiet parts of our minds are very good at solving problems that are too hard for our conscious minds.
We often think that being smart means being able to solve problems quickly, but that's not always true. Being smart also means being able to think slowly and deeply. This is important for solving complex problems and coming up with creative ideas. Poets and philosophers have known this for a long time, and now scientists are starting to understand it too."

I'm staying in a special camp in a very remote place. It's a friendly and well-equipped camp where scientists, students, and weather forecasters live together. There are about 40 people here, and we all help each other. My school French is good enough to communicate, but I struggle to have a conversation or joke with others. I miss the small talk and my phrasebook doesn't help at breakfast. I was worried about making friends and felt shy at first. I would hesitate to join in conversations and felt anxious, just like when I was in school. I still feel a bit nervous when people talk to me.
I used to be very good at speaking and making friends easily. But now, I'm not as confident as I used to be. I think it's because I'm not used to not being the center of attention.

He didn't care about abstract ideas or complicated theories, and he didn't try to make his movies too deep. He just wanted to make beautiful movies that would make people feel something.

Astronomy has changed a lot in the past 50 years. Until 30 years ago, there were not many books or charts to help people learn about astronomy. Now, there are many telescopes and computers that make it easier to study the stars. This should make it a great time for amateur astronomers. However, some things have become worse. It's harder to find a clear sky to look at the stars because of airplanes and pollution. This makes it difficult to observe the sun and stars at night.

Dr. Johnson said that writing is not easy. He believed that what is written with effort is usually read with pleasure. I looked back at my old school essays and was surprised to see how few mistakes I made. I think it's because writing by hand takes more time and makes you think carefully about what you're writing. Computers make it too easy and can lead to mistakes.
People used to write letters by hand, but now they send emails. This is good because people are writing more, but the emails can be sloppy and lack care. Words on a screen can be boring and lack the feeling of handwritten words.

'Breakfast in England: A New Tradition
Health experts agree that breakfast is very important, but in the past, it was not a common meal in England. In olden times, people didn't usually eat breakfast, unless they were rich or important. There are a few mentions of people eating in the morning in old stories, but it wasn't a normal thing to do.
However, in the 1500s, breakfast started to become more popular. Some people think this is because food became more widely available. Others believe that changes in work patterns might have also played a role. Many people started working at fixed times, often very early in the morning. So, having breakfast became necessary, rather than just a luxury for the rich.
This change in breakfast habits was not just about food, but also about social changes.'

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show and how to show it based on their skills, personal opinions, and experience. They also consider what others think and expect. In this book, we'll see how these factors affect the way a photo looks and what it means to the person looking at it.
For example, when you see a photo in a newspaper, you might not just accept it as it is. You might wonder if it's a real picture of what happened or if it shows what the photographer wanted to say. Is it just a moment in time or is it a symbol of something bigger?
For me, sports are more than just a game. The best athletes have a strong sense of self-confidence. To succeed, you need to focus on your goal and not worry about anything else. Sports can teach you discipline and determination, but it also shows you the importance of working together with others. My sport allows me to be an individual, but it's also a team effort. It's like life - you can succeed on your own, but you can't forget about others.
Sports have given me many good things, like new experiences and opportunities. But you also have to give up some things to get those benefits.
Sometimes, certain experiences stay with us and become clear memories. For me, one special moment happened in California many years ago. I was lying awake at night, listening to a mockingbird singing in a tree outside my window. The bird's beautiful singing kept me awake, and I felt like I was listening to a jazz or Indian classical music concert. I was amazed by the bird's skill and creativity. I was so impressed that I finally fell asleep."

Birds have always been important to human culture. People have had different feelings about them, from loving them to fearing them. But what does this say about us? 
I'm sitting in my greenhouse, listening to a wren bumping against the glass. It's a special bird that people have believed to have special powers. Some people think it's trying to tell us something, while others just think it's stuck. 
Wrens have been a part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the direction a wren flew in would tell them their luck. Today, people still have pictures and ceramics with wrens on them. This shows that wrens are still important to us, even if we don't believe in their magic powers anymore. 
Birds are important to us because they are connected to our history and culture. We have stories and legends about many birds, like the red kite. In the past, people loved red kites because they would take food from children's hands. But later, people started to see them as pests and they almost disappeared. Now, people are trying to protect them again. 
Our relationship with birds is not just about culture. It's also about who we are as humans. We are fascinated by birds because they can fly, sing, and are free. This is a reminder of who we are and our place in nature. 
Some people might think that our feelings about birds are just old-fashioned and not important anymore. But they are still part of who we are. That's why birds are important indicators of the health of our environment. 
Birds carry a lot of cultural meaning. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are symbols of love and magic. When these birds disappear, we lose a part of our culture. 
Folklore is important because it helps us connect with the natural world and understand our place in it. The stories and legends we tell about birds help us feel a deeper connection to them. 
When we watch birds, we can't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement. We can't fully explain why, but it's like they're trying to tell us something. The wren in the greenhouse is a reminder of this mystery and the connection we have with the natural world."

Maps help us understand the relationships between different places and features on the Earth's surface. Two important things to consider are distance and direction. In the past, people used different ways to measure distance, like the time it takes to travel. For direction, people used landmarks, signs, and symbols. Maps have changed over time as new technologies and ideas have developed. 
Early maps were often used for navigation and trade. Later, maps were used for military purposes, like planning battles. Today, maps are used in many fields, such as archaeology, history, and geography. Cartographers (people who make maps) have had to adapt to new demands and technologies. They have developed new methods to show different types of information, like geological data and climate zones. 
The study of maps is important because it helps us understand how people have thought about the world over time. Maps are a record of human knowledge and progress. They are a fascinating and valuable resource for learning about the past."

Language is a special ability that we have. We can use it to communicate with each other in a very precise way. Language is a part of our daily lives. When we're with other people, we usually talk to each other. Even when we're alone, we might talk to ourselves, our pets, or even plants! I like to think of language as an instinct, like how some animals have a natural ability to do certain things.
Climate and weather have a big impact on the world around us. They can affect the types of plants and animals that live in a place. For example, warm and wet weather allows for lush jungles to grow, while cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things.

Why is it that TV shows about art are often not very good? Painting and sculpture should be perfect for TV, because it can show the whole artwork and then zoom in on the details. But I can't think of many TV shows that do a good job of showing the pleasure and complexity of looking at art. A recent example of what goes wrong is a TV series about American art. The presenter, Robert Hughes, is a well-known art critic, and he was given eight hours to introduce British audiences to a type of American art that is not well-known in the UK. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
I used to work in the metals market for 20 years. I was known for being a good speculator. Metals are not regulated as much as other markets, so it's possible to make a lot of money if you're willing to take a risk. The industry is known for being a bit wild and free-spirited, which fits well with the idea of a free market economy. However, some economists who believed that the market would keep prices high because of the scarcity of metals have been proved wrong. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. After inflation, the prices of most metals are now half of what they were 20 years ago.
I recently looked into allegations made against a big company that benefits from cheap raw materials.

**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in London**
In a small workshop in Hackney Wick, London, you can learn to build your own bamboo bike. Engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan run the Bamboo Bike Club, where you can design and build your own custom bike frame over a weekend. Bamboo is a popular material for bike frames because it's strong, sustainable, and unique.
James and Ian started the club because they wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for everyone. They used to work on their own designs in a shed in Wales, but now they share their knowledge with others. The course costs less than £500, which is much cheaper than buying a ready-made bamboo bike.
On the first day, you'll learn how to select the right bamboo and assemble the frame. It's a bit tricky, but James and Ian are there to help you. They'll show you how to use special tools and design blueprints to make sure your bike is strong and safe.
The second day is more relaxed, and you'll focus on building the lugs and adding the finishing touches. You'll get to choose the design and color of your bike, and you'll be amazed at how unique it looks. The bamboo bikes are not only eco-friendly but also really fun to ride.
James and Ian have tested their bikes on long commutes and off-road adventures, and they say they're as strong as metal bikes. They're proud of their work and enjoy sharing their passion with others.
So, if you're interested in building your own bike and want to try something new, the Bamboo Bike Club is the perfect place to start. You'll learn new skills, make new friends, and have a bike that's all your own."

I remember visiting an arts and crafts exhibition where I saw ladies painting beautiful flowers on teacups. They were very skilled and precise. I wondered if beginners would have the courage to take a course in china-painting. But when I attended a class, I found that everyone was there to have fun, not just to be perfect. The tutor didn't want us to paint quickly and perfectly either.

Keith and Dawne booked a package holiday to Venice, Italy, but something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel in Switzerland instead. They gave their tickets to a woman at the airport, and she checked their details. But when they got to the hotel, they realized it was the wrong one. The receptionist told them they were booked for 12 nights, and they were in the wrong group.
Keith and Dawne tried to explain to the receptionist that they were meant to be in Venice, but he didn't know what they were talking about. They showed him a picture of the travel agency in London and described the man who booked their trip. The receptionist didn't know what to do.
Then, a woman came and introduced herself as Mrs. Franks. She explained that there were many different holidays with Your-Kind-of-Holiday, and sometimes people got mixed up. She said that all the tickets and labels looked similar, and it was easy to get confused.
Keith and Dawne were still unhappy and wanted to go to Venice. Mrs. Franks said she would try to help them. But before she did, Keith and Dawne noticed an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, who were also on the package tour. They were very nice and had slept well in their room.
Keith and Dawne didn't say much to each other about their mistake, but they knew they were in the wrong place. They had wanted to get away from the demands of their elderly relatives, but now they were surrounded by elderly people.

Many American business leaders are looking at Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer, as an example of good management. Most people in the UK know who Shackleton was, but Americans are just discovering him. They are making up for lost time by producing books, exhibitions, and a film about his life.
Some American managers are using Shackleton as a role model. They like his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton was a determined and resourceful person who kept his team safe in very difficult situations. He was a good leader because he had strong values and was willing to take responsibility.
Shackleton's story can be applied to business. When a company faces a crisis, people want to know that someone is in charge. Shackleton was brave and made difficult decisions to keep his team safe. He was also good at communicating with his team and keeping them informed.
Jim MacGregor, a management consultant, thinks Shackleton is a great example of a good leader. He says that Shackleton's qualities, such as optimism, physical endurance, and patience, are important for success. Shackleton believed in not giving up and being willing to change plans if something is not working.
Shackleton's story is inspiring because he showed that even in difficult situations, you can still be a good leader and keep your team safe. He is a reminder that leadership is not just about making money, but about taking care of people and doing the right thing.

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special primate called the aye-aye. It has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker. The woodpecker uses its beak to drill into wood and its long tongue to catch insects. The aye-aye uses its teeth to chew through wood and its long finger to find insects. Scientists have studied how the aye-aye finds its food. They tested two aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, and a female with her baby, Samantha and Annabelle. The scientists wanted to know if the aye-ayes use visual clues like holes in the wood to find insects. But the aye-ayes didn't need these clues. They could find the insects even when there were no holes.
The scientists thought maybe the aye-ayes use their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects. But they found out that they don't use these senses either. The aye-ayes can find empty cavities and those with insects. They must be able to sense the cavity itself.
When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and brings its big ears forward. The scientists think that the aye-aye is using a special way of finding things by listening to the echoes of its taps. It might also hear the insects moving when it taps the wood.
The aye-aye is special because it can do things that other animals can't. It can be like a woodpecker, an echo-locating bat, and a squirrel all at the same time. It has teeth that grow like a squirrel's, and it can even crack open nuts to eat the inside.

Most people have old family photos, but do we really know what our grandparents were like when they were young? We might have a few memories from our parents, but what will our own grandchildren know about us? We often mean to write things down, but never get around to it. Hannah Renier has found a way to preserve ordinary people's stories. She writes books about them, with pictures if they want. She talks to people and writes down their stories, making sure they are honest and true.
Hannah started doing this because she realized that her own family's past was disappearing. She asked her family members about their lives, and they shared stories with her. They told her about their struggles and successes, and how they overcame challenges. Hannah realized that people want to share their stories, but they don't always know how.
The people Hannah writes about are not famous, but they have interesting stories to tell. They are willing to share their stories because they know that Hannah will keep their secrets. They enjoy talking about their lives and remembering the past.
Hannah's books are not cheap, but they are worth it. Each book takes a lot of time and effort to make. She records her interviews and then writes the story, making sure it is easy to understand. The final product is a beautiful book that the person's family will treasure.
Hannah's goal is to help people remember their ancestors and their stories. She believes that this is important because people are losing touch with their past. She wants to give people a way to connect with their family history and remember their loved ones.

Here are the simplified texts for each section, suitable for a B1 level learner:
A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology
The Museum of Classical Archaeology has a big collection of sculptures from ancient Greece and Rome. There are over 600 sculptures, but none of them are the originals. They are all copies made from the originals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The museum is in a special building with good lighting. The best thing about the copies is that they can be seen together, even if the originals are in different museums. This way, you can see famous sculptures from ancient Greece and Rome all in one place.
B. Cambridge Darkroom
Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography. They have darkrooms where you can develop your photos, and a gallery with exhibitions. They offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels. You can join their membership scheme and use their darkrooms. They also have books and magazines about photography and sell photographic materials.
C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology
The Sedgwick Museum has a big collection of fossils, rocks, and minerals from all over the world. It also has the oldest geological collection in Britain, which was started by a professor of geology named Dr. John Woodward. The collection is arranged by age, so you can see how life on Earth changed over time. The museum also has a special room with beautiful minerals and gems.
D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs
The University of Cambridge has a big collection of air photographs taken over the past 45 years. They have their own aircraft and take photos all over Britain.

A. The theatre director
I have been blessed with three children, and I have loved every minute of it. I have been lucky to have them, and we all share the same interests: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I am more like a friend to them. I have made mistakes as a father, like slapping them in anger, but I don't think it's the right way. I have always tried to be available for them, and I am always here if they need me.
B. The advertising executive
I was young when my children were born, and it was a big change for me. It made me grow up quickly, but it also kept me young. As they got older, they introduced me to new things, like music and fashion, which has been helpful for my work. I sometimes missed important events, like concerts and sports days, but now I can take them on holiday to France.
C. The politician
I have been busy with my work, but I make sure to spend time with my children. I only accept meetings and events on weekends when they can come with me. This way, they understand what I do and don't feel left out. More and more politicians are bringing their kids to work, and I think we are all realizing the importance of involving our children in our lives.
D. The writer
I was a single father for a while, and it made me think about what it means to be a good father. I tried my best to stay close to my children, even when we didn't live together. My daughter says I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was the best father. I was too relaxed and didn't set enough rules. I regret that now and still worry about my children.
E. The TV presenter
I was ready for a child, and having my daughter has changed me. It's a big responsibility, but it's also a great experience. Being a parent makes you realize that you are part of a long line of parents. It can be challenging, but it's worth it when I look at my daughter's smile. It's the best way to forget about any problems.

'Flying against gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students on a special flight to test their ideas. The plane looked like a normal one from the outside, but it was actually a special Boeing KC-135 that had been changed to make it feel like being in space. Thirteen students from Europe and America boarded the plane, excited to take part in the flight. They had won a competition to come up with creative ideas for experiments to do in weightless conditions. The students had to sit in a special area with no windows, but it was lit up by lights on the walls. The seats had been removed, except for a few at the back where the students sat nervously. They had been chosen to be part of this special flight because their ideas were the best.
The plane took off and went up, up, up, then down, down, down. This made the students feel weightless for a few seconds. They could move around freely and do experiments. One group of students tested how a robotic cat would move in space. Another group looked at how metal joins work in space, which could be important for building space stations. Another group tried to make special solar sails that could be used on satellites.
After two hours of flying, the students felt happy and excited. They had never experienced anything like it before. One student said, ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want to even more.""'

I had a unique experience in my life. For nine years, I spent my summers in New Zealand, which is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. My parents wanted to give my brother, sister, and me a special gift. They bought a small piece of land, and if we could take care of it and plant trees, it would be ours. My father was born in New Zealand, so it was a special place for our family.
The land was not very good for farming, but it was perfect for planting trees. I had worked on farms in Australia before, so I was excited to plant trees. My brother and sister were also enthusiastic about the project. We started planting in 1968 and finished in 1972. It was a challenging experience, especially since it rained a lot that year. But we enjoyed it and were proud of what we accomplished.
Planting trees was hard work, but it was also very satisfying. We had to wear special bags around our necks to carry the trees, and we had to make sure to plant them in straight lines. It was a lot of physical work, but it made me strong and fit. After a while, I got into a rhythm and could plant trees easily.
As I worked, I had a lot of time to think about life and the natural world. I started to think about our place in the world and how we can take care of it. This experience had a big impact on me and influenced my life.
I have visited New Zealand four times since then and seen the trees grow. It's been wonderful to see how they have thrived. Sometimes I worry about the weather in New Zealand, especially when there are big storms or droughts. But overall, it was a great experience, and I'm proud of what we accomplished.
In 1984, I went back to New Zealand for three months and wrote my first book, Seeing Green. I stayed in a small cabin on the farm and spent my days writing, pruning trees, and doing research. The connection I have with that place is still very strong. It's a special place that reminds me of the importance of our connection with the earth."

We turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago. Since then, we've helped many orphaned animals. One day, some builders brought us three small grey badger cubs. They were only about 20 centimeters long and had soft, fluffy coats. We had never seen badger cubs before. The mother was dead, and the cubs were cold and hungry.
We named the cubs Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow. We fed them with a syringe and wiped their faces with a warm cloth to make them feel like their mother was licking them. After a few days, they started to drink from a bottle and move around. They were very happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.
But one day, Willow got sick and died. We were very sad. The vet said he died from a lung infection because we fed him too much liquid too quickly. We continued to care for the other two cubs.
A few days later, a local farmer found another badger cub abandoned in the field. We named him Willow II. He was smaller than the other two and had trouble eating. We had to move the bottle around and squeeze it to get him to drink. After a few weeks, he started to eat on his own.
As they grew, we fed them different foods like cereals, fruits, and nuts. They loved to play in the long grass and chase each other's tails. We would join in and play with them.
As the summer was very hot, we noticed that they were having trouble finding food. We even saw other badgers in our field looking for food. We were worried that they might attack our cubs, so we put a metal sheet over the gate to keep them out.
The local press took pictures of us walking the badgers, and people were very interested. We started an appeal to build a special home for the badgers. With the help of many people, we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. The badgers loved their new home and explored it before going on their nightly walks.
Now, the badgers are happy and healthy, and we still see them occasionally. They are no longer babies, and they have their own territory. We are proud of what we did for them."

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, a famous astronomer. Halley is known for discovering a comet, but he also did important work on the compass. He wanted to find out how the compass needle moved when you were far from the North Pole. This is called ""declination"". Without this information, sailors couldn't navigate the seas accurately.
Halley sailed on a ship called the Paramore to chart the declination in the North and South Atlantic. He went on two voyages, but the first one was cut short because of problems with the crew. On his second voyage, he sailed to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland before returning to England. He wrote a book about his findings, which was very useful for sailors for many years.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by sailing the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 to do this. Dr. Clark is a sailor himself and became interested in Halley's work while he was working in Antarctica. He thinks Halley was a remarkable person who did many important things, not just discovering a comet.
Dr. Clark's expedition will be different from Halley's because they will have more advanced instruments. They will use satellites to find true north and make more accurate measurements. The data they collect will help scientists understand the Earth's magnetic field better. Dr. Clark is excited about the project and is willing to spend eight months at sea to complete it. He thinks it's a good way to honor Halley's legacy.

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their beautiful tails to the hens. This has puzzled scientists for a long time. How did these birds evolve such a useless feature? Do they really need it to survive?
A team of scientists from the Open University is trying to find the answer. They are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, where they live in a natural environment but are used to humans. The team wants to know two main things: Do the hens really choose the males with the most beautiful tails? And do these males have any special advantages that help them survive?
The scientists observed the peacocks and took pictures. They found that the hens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. The males with the most eye-spots get more mates. But the scientists still don't know if these males are also better in other ways.
One scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that showy birds are often healthier and less likely to have parasites. The Whipsnade team is trying to test this idea by comparing the offspring of attractive and unattractive males. They want to see if the offspring of attractive males grow faster and are healthier.
There is another idea, called ""Fisher's Runaway"", which suggests that a female's preference for a certain type of male can lead to a change in the species over time. This could explain why peacocks have such long tails. Interestingly, this idea would also support Darwin's idea that females choose males for their beauty.

'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design combines old and new. He built his own boat, ""The Westerman"", which looks like it's from the past, but has modern technology inside. This week, the London Boat Show is showcasing many new and high-tech yachts. My boat is different. It's quiet and old-fashioned, but I designed it with modern help.
I wanted my boat to have the best of both worlds: the old-fashioned feel and the new technology. It's not easy to make a boat like this, but it's worth it. Some people might think that using modern technology makes sailing too easy, but I think it's important to still have some challenges.
I used to sail an old boat called Hirta, which had no modern comforts. It was hard work, but it was a great experience. When I had to stop sailing because of an injury, I decided to build a new boat. I worked with a designer to create a boat that would be easy to sail and maintain. The Westerman has been a great success. It's sailed across the Atlantic and has won many races.
I think the key to a good boat is to make it simple and functional. I didn't want to make it too fancy or comfortable, because that would make it feel like a house on the water. I wanted it to be a real boat, not a luxury yacht. The Westerman is made of wood, which makes it strong and durable. It's also very peaceful and comfortable to sail.'

**Natural Talents**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. In fact, we are 98% identical genetically. This means that whatever makes humans different from animals must have developed recently. Our physical abilities, such as making art, must be due to a small number of genes. This is a big responsibility for those genes.
Studies of animal behavior have shown that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open shells. Even monkeys have a simple language with different sounds for warning about predators.
If human art is unique, it's strange that our ancestors didn't create art for the first 6.9 million years after they separated from chimpanzees. The earliest art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't know for sure because those materials don't last long.
The first clear evidence of human art is from around 35,000 years ago, in the form of cave paintings, statues, and jewelry. If we want to say that human art is special, we need to explain how it's different from animal art. Three differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it's made for pleasure, and it's learned, not inherited.
Let's look at these claims. Some people say that human art is not useful, like animal behaviors that help us survive or pass on our genes. But human art can communicate with others, even if it's not about survival. Birds sing to defend their territory or find a mate, so they're not just singing for pleasure.
Another claim is that human art is not motivated by pleasure. While we can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, it's likely that they're singing for a reason. Again, human art seems different.
The third claim is that human art is learned, not inherited. While humans can learn different art styles, some animals are born with the ability to make specific sounds. For example, birds learn their songs from their parents, but they can also learn from other birds.
The article also talks about two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, who created art for their own pleasure. Their paintings were exhibited in a London art gallery and even sold. This shows that art can be created for its own sake, not just for survival or communication.
Overall, the article questions what makes human art unique and whether it's really that different from animal art."

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very dangerous and unknown place. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. It's not easy to find big adventures like this anymore. Charles led an expedition across the desert with a team of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. They had never worked with camels before, which was a big problem.
The team set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles was leaving the Army after 14 years and wanted to do something new. He wrote a book about their journey. It took 59 days to cross the desert, and they had many difficulties like dysentery, extreme temperatures, and lack of water.
Despite the challenges, they found some water and didn't experience the strong sandstorms or extreme cold. But the fine sand got into their clothes and wounds, and the high dunes were hard to climb. Charles was scared, but he knew he had to keep going to survive.
As they walked, they got thinner and stronger. Charles thought about his family and how they must have been worried about him. He is proud of what they achieved, but he knows that his family and their happiness are more important.
Charles still likes the feeling of adventure and the sense of purpose it gives him. He finds it hard to be part of modern life now.

I used to feel overwhelmed by all the technology in my life. I decided to stop using some of my gadgets and go back to doing things by hand. I found that this made me feel more relaxed and happy. I no longer need a washing machine, so I do my laundry by hand. I also stopped using a sewing machine and now sew by hand. This has given me more time to do other things I enjoy, like reading and talking to my family.
I used to think that technology made my life easier, but I realize now that it can also be a source of stress. I'm not tied to a machine, and I can take my time to do things. I can even do them while listening to the radio or watching TV. I feel more in control of my life and my time.
I'm not saying that technology is all bad. There are some things I would miss, like my washing machine. But there are other things that I can live without, like my microwave oven. I'm starting to think that we don't need all these gadgets to be happy. We can still live simple, happy lives without them.

Sleep is a big part of our lives. We spend about one-third of our time sleeping. Scientists are trying to figure out why we need so much sleep. There are three main ideas about what sleep does.
One idea is that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. When we sleep, our bodies fix any damage we did during the day and get ready for the next day.
Another idea is that sleep helps us learn. When we sleep, our brains process the things we learned during the day. Without sleep, we wouldn't be able to learn new things.
The third idea is that sleep gives us energy. When we sleep, our bodies recharge like batteries, so we have energy for the next day.

What is an eccentric? An eccentric is someone who behaves in an unusual way, not following the normal rules of society. But what is normal, anyway? We all have our own quirks and things that make us different. Maybe you love collecting things, or have strong opinions, or do things that others don't understand. Being eccentric means being true to yourself and not caring what others think.
But it's not always easy. Deep inside, we have two sides: one that wants to be like everyone else, and one that wants to be different. Most of the time, the desire to fit in is stronger. That's why people with unusual hobbies or interests often join groups or clubs to meet others who understand them.
We all have a mix of both individuality and conformity within us. Sometimes we feel like we're going along with the crowd, but we also want to stand out and be ourselves. It's like having two trains on the same track, pushing against each other.
Some people, like artists or musicians, have been successful by being true to themselves and not following the crowd. They don't try to be different, they just are different. The key to being eccentric is being natural and not caring what others think. It's not about trying to shock or impress others, but about being who you are.
For example, someone who loves collecting unusual things or has strong opinions might not even notice that others think they're strange. They just do what they like, and that's what makes them eccentric."

We asked four experts in nature to tell us about the book that has had the biggest influence on them. A journalist named Geoffrey Lean chose a book by Barbara Ward. She was a famous environmentalist who wrote about the importance of taking care of the Earth. Geoffrey thinks her book ""The Home of Man"" is very important because it talks about how people should live in harmony with nature.
Linda Bennett chose a book called ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen. This book is about animal communication and how animals talk to each other. It's written in a way that's easy to understand, even for people who aren't experts in science.
Lee Durrell chose a book called ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book is about his family's adventures with animals. Lee was inspired by the book and decided to work in conservation.
Bruce Pearson chose a book called ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher. This book is about birds and has beautiful pictures of them. It helped Bruce learn more about birds and appreciate the natural world.
The books chosen by these experts are all important because they help us understand and appreciate the natural world. They show us that taking care of the Earth is important and that we can learn from animals and nature."

DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five British publishers about the effect of book reviews on sales. Here's what they said.
Publisher A: Reviews are very important for us. In fact, a study found that many people buy a book because of a good review. Authors and publishers have different reactions to reviews. Authors are often upset if a book gets no reviews, while publishers are more calm about bad reviews. They think that some negative reviews can even help sales.
Publisher B: Publishers and newspapers have different goals. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to promote their books. Book reviewing has changed over the years. While it's more diverse and less elitist now, there's still a problem: many paperbacks don't get reviewed.
Publisher C: Reviews are crucial for our business. Without them, we wouldn't know how readers like our books. We depend on literary editors to give our books space. When the reviews are good, they can be very helpful.
Publisher D: It's hard to understand the relationship between publishing and reviewing in the UK. In the US, one review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, it's more unpredictable. Some books get bad reviews and still sell well, while others get great reviews and don't sell much.
Publisher E: Of course, everyone wants great reviews. But do they really sell books? I published a biography that got amazing reviews, but it didn't sell well. People thought they didn't need to buy the book because they had read the reviews. Does the reviewer's name matter? In the past, if certain reviewers praised a book, people would buy it. Now, it's more about the reviewer's style and originality that makes people want to buy the book.

WEATHERVANE MAKER Graham Smith is one of the few people in the country who still makes hand-cut weathervanes. He has been doing this for a long time and loves his job. Graham's weathervanes are special because he designs them himself and makes them just for the person who wants one. He likes to make unique gifts that show what someone likes or does for a living.
Graham used to work as a precision engineer, but he and his wife decided to switch roles. She went to work and he stayed home to take care of the children and build his weathervane business. He has been doing this for five years now and is very happy.
Graham has made over 100 different designs and is always looking for new ideas. He works very carefully and makes sure the person who wants the weathervane likes the design before he cuts it out. He also keeps some traditional designs in stock because people still like them.
Graham likes that his business is small and local. He enjoys seeing people happy with his weathervanes and likes that they are unique. Weathervanes have been around for a long time and were used to show people the direction of the wind. Now, more people are moving to the country and want to make their homes special. This is good for Graham's business.
Graham has been getting more and more orders, even from people in America and Denmark. He likes making weathervanes and is happy to be able to do what he loves for a living."

Before his book was published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was already very popular. It was the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it earned him a lot of money. He talks about his inspiration and his success.
Nicholas Evans had a difficult start to the year. A film project he had been working on for months fell through. He was worried because he hadn't earned any money in two years and the project was his only way to pay his bills. Instead of getting a job, he decided to take a risk and go to America for three months to research his first novel. He had always been fascinated by the story of a farrier who could calm down angry horses just by talking to them. This man was called a ""horse whisperer"".
Evans spent the spring traveling across the US, learning about horses and the people who work with them. He was alone and felt like his life was falling apart. He had been trying to make it as a film-maker for 10 years, but he was in debt and didn't know how he would feed his family. He thought about giving up, but he kept writing.
When he finished the first half of the book, he showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was good and said Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more money to pay off his debts, so he was disappointed. However, his agent sent the book to seven publishers and one of them offered $75,000. The book was then sold to two publishers for a record-breaking amount of money. The film rights were also sold, and Evans became a famous author.
Evans is grateful for his success, but he is also careful. He doesn't want to give up control of his work and become an employee of the film industry. He wants to write another novel and is considering making a new film project, but he is not sure what to do."

Bobby Fischer, a famous chess player, has come out of retirement to play again. He is 49 years old and hasn't played chess in 20 years. His opponent is Boris Spassky, who is also old. Chess has changed a lot since Fischer's time. Now, professional chess players focus more on winning than on being good at the game. The game is also more physically and mentally demanding. Players need to be in good shape and have a lot of endurance. The game is timed, and players have to make their moves quickly. If they don't, they lose.
Young players are now more successful than older ones. Most of the top 10 players are under 30 years old. This is because the game has changed and requires a lot of practice and preparation. Players use computers to analyze games and find weaknesses in their opponents' strategies. They also work with teams to prepare for matches.
Playing chess is not just about being good at the game; it's also about being physically and mentally strong. Players need to be able to concentrate for a long time and make quick decisions. The pressure is high, and players can get very tired and stressed.
Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to the top, but it's not easy. He will have to play many matches and tournaments, and he will need to be in good shape and have a strong team to help him prepare. If he wins, he will get a lot of money, but if he loses, it could be very difficult for him."

**Fame and Success**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to the top.
Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is a playwright who has written three successful plays. He is now working on a screenplay for his first play, Peaches. ""It's a low-budget film, but we don't know how low yet,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30.""
What's amazing about Nick is that he had never seen or read a play before he wrote Peaches. ""I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I might not do that now because I know the problems it would cause. I knew nothing then.""
Nick left school at 16 and went back a year later. He then joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors,"" he says. ""I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read. It's about rhythm and rhyme."" He enjoyed his time at the theatre because he was surrounded by like-minded people. It was the first time he enjoyed school.
Simon Pegg, 28, is a comedian who has come a long way since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard, even when he was at university. ""It was very theoretical,"" he remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor. I've always been more interested in comedy.""
Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he danced his way into people's living rooms as the lead in the TV series The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. The reaction was very positive, and his career has taken off. ""It's been a great showcase for me,"" he says. ""I can now choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted.""
Ciaran started acting at school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre. He stayed there for four years. ""I was using acting as an excuse not to do my homework,"" he laughs. ""But I decided to make a go of it because I was good at it and I loved it.""
Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be huge when their single, Chimera, is released soon. ""The record company thinks it will be a big hit, but I'm not sure,"" he says. ""For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy.""
Neil left school at 16 and has been trying to make it in the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was about to give up when this happened."" By ""this,"" he means meeting Rick Brown and forming Matrix.
Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many awards. He is already well-known on the poetry circuit and has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, Hidden, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love,"" he says. ""It was a strong idea that I couldn't do as a poem."" Stephen was a big fan of creative writing at school, but became disenchanted with education later on. ""I decided not to go to university, but it wasn't until I was bored with my job at a theatre that I decided I should write."""

International Volunteering: Is it Helpful or Harmful?
A. Some people think that international volunteering doesn't really help developing countries. They say that volunteers often pay a lot of money to do the work, which could be used to hire local workers instead. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who don't need special skills or experience. This raises questions about whether they are really helping or just trying to look good on their CV.
B. Volunteering can have many benefits. It can help people understand each other better, solve conflicts, and work together for the good of the world. It can also create a sense of global community and help people connect with each other. However, if only rich people from wealthy countries get to volunteer, it might not help those who need it most.
C. International volunteering can be good or bad. It can be a way for wealthy Westerners to help others, but it can also be a way for them to feel good about themselves without really making a difference. At its best, volunteering can bring people together and help them learn from each other.
D. Some people think that volunteer tourism is a good way to help others. It seems like a simple and positive way to make a difference. However, it can also be a way to avoid dealing with the real problems that cause poverty and inequality. Instead of trying to change the system, people might just focus on doing small acts of charity. This can be a problem, because it doesn't address the root causes of poverty and inequality.

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up. But, most people also need something to help them get out of bed. That's where the clock radio comes in. How do you choose a good one? Our team tested five different models. We found that one model was the best. It has a special feature called a ""dual alarm function"". This means you can set two different wake-up times - one for weekdays and one for weekends. This is useful, but it's not very practical for most people.
The clock radio we liked the most has a cassette player. You can listen to your own music before you go to sleep and wake up to the radio without any noise. The radio quality is very good, but the clock radio is quite big. It's like a rugby ball!
We all liked the design of this clock radio. The buttons are easy to use, and the display is clear and easy to read. The clock also has a special feature that saves the time if the power goes off. This is very useful.
However, we found it a bit difficult to set up the clock radio. It took some time to figure out how to use it. But, once we did, we felt proud of ourselves. The clock radio also has a built-in lamp, but it's not very useful. The light is too small and only shines on the clock.
One of the other clock radios we tested was very popular. It's brightly colored and has a fun design. It's easy to use and doesn't take up much space. However, the alarm can be a bit tricky to set, and it's not very accurate.
The simplest and cheapest clock radio we tested was also one of the best. It's easy to use and takes up little space. However, it's old-fashioned and doesn't have all the fancy features of the other models.
In the end, we chose the best clock radio based on its features, design, and ease of use. We hope this helps you choose the right clock radio for you!"

""Hedgehogs are small mammals covered with sharp spines. They live in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a ball when they feel threatened, so their spines stick out. This helps protect them, but it depends on how many spines they have. Some hedgehogs in the desert have fewer spines because they need to carry their weight. They might try to run away instead of rolling into a ball. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They like to sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. Some hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs stay awake all year round.""

""Great female athletes on a winning streak
It's not easy to be a successful athlete, but women have to work even harder. They have to make sacrifices in their personal life and give up many things they enjoy. But despite these challenges, many women are achieving great things. We spoke to five British female athletes who are doing just that.
A. Jill, a 27-year-old skier, says: ""It's an amazing feeling to fly down the slopes, but it can be scary. Sometimes the weather is bad or I don't feel well, but I just keep going. It's hard to have a normal life outside of skiing because we train for most of the year. But it was my choice.""
B. Caroline, a 22-year-old cyclist, says: ""I started cycling two years ago and won a charity race. I didn't know how to cycle before, but I was faster than everyone else! As a professional cyclist, I earn a good income and have many opportunities for sponsorship. But sometimes I worry that people think I'm successful because of how I look, not because I'm a good cyclist.""
C. Annabel, a 26-year-old rower, says: ""Rowing is a tough sport for women because not many girls learn to row in school. So, many women start later and it's harder to become a top athlete. We also have coaches who don't stay with us for long, which makes it hard to improve. But I love being fit and the social aspect of rowing is great.""
D. Ffyona, a 24-year-old long-distance walker, says: ""I've always wanted to walk around the world. I started when I was 13 and have been doing it ever since. It's been tough, especially in hot weather with blisters on my feet. But I got the record and it was worth it. Some people think women are more likely to fail, so it's harder for us to get sponsors.""
E. Lisa, a 26-year-old saloon car racer, says: ""Some men can be very competitive and aggressive when they're racing. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. As a woman, I face some challenges, but I love the thrill of racing and trying to be perfect.""
F. Alison, a 28-year-old triathlete, says: ""I have to get up early three mornings a week to swim. I need some time to sleep and then I cycle or run in the evening. It's a lot of hard work, but I feel happy and fulfilled when I'm fit. I do get tired and sometimes wonder why I do it, but the answer is that I love the social aspect and the feeling of achievement.""
These women are all achieving great things in their respective sports, despite the challenges they face. They are role models for young girls and women everywhere, showing that with hard work and determination, anything is possible."""

I met Picasso when I was 18 years old. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco with a friend in a old van. We had run out of money, so I got a job painting boats on the waterfront. I was also drawing a lot, and I had a big sketchbook with me. One day, I saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. He was an old man, but he was still very famous and respected. I was surprised to see him because he was known to be a private person who didn't like to be seen in public.
I was too shy to approach him, but my friend encouraged me to go over and ask for his signature. I was amazed when he agreed, and he even drew a picture on the paper. I showed him my sketchbook and he drew a portrait of me. He was a very good artist and he made me look like a character from one of his paintings.
After he finished drawing, he handed the paper back to me and said it was my turn. I was nervous, but he showed me how to draw a simple face. He was very kind and patient with me. When he finished, I thanked him and asked if he would sign the drawing. He said I already had his signature, so he didn't need to sign it again.
I was very lucky to meet Picasso and to have him draw with me. It was an amazing experience that I will always remember.

Have you ever gone into a shop and bought more than you meant to? Shops use special tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of the ways they do it:
A. Fresh and clean
Shops know that people like to buy fresh food. They put fresh fruit and vegetables near the entrance and make the store smell like freshly baked bread. They also use green colours to make it look fresh and clean.
B. Where you find things
Shops put things where they think you will find them most easily. They put popular items near the entrance and expensive things in hard-to-reach places. They also put things together that go well together, like salad dressings and burgers.
C. Making you walk around
Shops put everyday items like bread and milk at the back of the store. This makes you walk past other things you might want to buy. They also put their own brand products far away from the entrance, hoping you'll look for them and buy other things on the way.
D. Making things look exclusive
Some shops make their products look exclusive by displaying only a few things on the shelves. This makes you think the products are special and you need to buy them.
E. The total price
Shops put a mix of cheap and expensive things in their stores. They know that people care more about the total price than the price of each item. They also put some things on sale to make you want to buy more.
F. The price tag
Shops make sure the price tag is easy to see and understand. They also make sure the prices are a little bit lower than the competition to make you want to buy from them.
G. Lighting
Shops use lighting to make things look good. They use natural light in clothes shops and special lighting in food shops to make the food look fresh and appetizing.
H. Guiding you through the store
Shops use different colours and patterns on the floor to guide you through the store. They want you to follow the path and see all the things they have to offer.
I. Advertising
Shops use big pictures and videos to advertise their products. They also use special screens on shopping carts to show you ads as you shop. This helps them sell more things to you.

One day, Chris and Robin decided to go on a trip to Greenland together. They sailed to the island and then climbed a big mountain called the Cathedral. Chris was impressed by Robin's climbing skills, even though he had never climbed before. Robin was good at using his arms to climb down ropes on his boat.
Chris and Robin had to work together to make decisions on the trip. Robin was a good leader who listened to everyone's opinions. Chris found the sailing part of the trip boring, but Robin enjoyed fixing things on the boat.
When they reached the mountain, Chris was worried about taking responsibility for Robin's safety. Robin wasn't a natural climber, but he was determined to reach the top. They had to turn back because it was too difficult, but Robin was okay with it.

Apples have been around for thousands of years. People have been eating them since prehistoric times. In the past, people found apple seeds and planted them to grow new trees. Over time, different varieties of apples were developed.
In ancient times, people in Britain and Switzerland grew wild apples. These apples were small and not very tasty. Later, the Romans brought new apple varieties from France and taught the British how to grow them. The British monks experimented with new apples and created many varieties that we still enjoy today.
In the 13th century, many types of apples were grown in Britain. One popular dessert apple was the Old English Pearmain. Another type, the Costard, was used for cooking and was sold in markets.
In the 16th century, Henry VIII ordered a fruit expert to visit France and learn about growing apples. This expert brought back new varieties, including the famous Pippins. These apples were grown in an orchard in Kent and became popular.
When people settled in new countries, they took apple seeds and trees with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. In the 19th century, a Quaker farmer discovered a new apple variety, which he named 'Delicious'.
In the 20th century, a woman named Maria Anne Smith discovered a new apple variety in Australia. She named it 'Granny Smith' and it became famous worldwide.
Today, apples are grown all over the world. However, many varieties are being lost because farmers only grow a few popular types. This is a problem because it reduces the variety of apples available and can make them taste less good.
We need to make sure that we protect the diversity of apples and other foods. This means supporting farmers who grow a variety of apples and buying apples from different places."

Richard Nerurkar, a famous long-distance runner from Britain, visited the training camp of Kenyan runners in the mountains. The camp is 10 miles south of the equator and 6,200 feet high. For three years, Richard had been training at this camp, but he had never trained with the Kenyan runners before. This time, he decided to join them and even compete in a race. Richard was invited to the camp by the Kenyan national team coach because he finished fifth in a big running competition.
Training at high altitude helps runners by increasing the number of red blood cells in their bodies. This is why many Kenyan runners are very good. Richard's first race in Kenya was also a big event. It was the first international cross-country race to be held in Africa. Richard didn't do as well as the Kenyan runners, but he didn't think he had a bad race.
Richard noticed that the Kenyan runners have a simple way of training. They run a lot, but they also take breaks and rest. They eat simple food and don't have many comforts. Richard stayed with the Kenyan runners for a week and saw how they lived and trained. They ran three times a day, with a total distance of about 40 kilometers. On Sundays, they only ran 20 kilometers.
Richard was impressed by the Kenyan runners' lifestyle and thought that their simplicity, hard work, and passion for running might be the reasons for their success."

Advertising is not working well. It has been declining since 1989, even before the economic recession. The problem is not just the recession, but that advertising is not keeping up with the changing economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people and big media, but as there are more brands and media, the groups are getting smaller. Advertisers rarely target the right people.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you buy many things, but most of them are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. Over a year, you probably buy a few hundred different brands, not thousands. And most of these are not advertised brands.
There are many brands advertised, but most people do not buy them. According to a study, the average person buys only 4% of the advertised brands. This means that 96% of advertising is wasted. When you watch TV, you might see a few commercials for brands you buy or might buy, but most are not for brands you care about.
Advertising is not effective because people do not pay attention to most ads. They only notice a few and ignore the rest. This is because it is hard to know who will respond to an ad. Even direct mail, which is more targeted, does not always work.
The best way to advertise is to target the right people. But it is hard to know who will respond. If an advertiser knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use media. They could just talk to those people directly.
For an advertiser to be successful, they need to reach a small group of people, about 2% of the population. This is a small group, but it is important. The most effective way to reach them is through mass media, but advertisers need to be more precise in their targeting to make their ads work.

Meet Charles Clover, who visited a very special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This house is called the ""autonomous house"" and is designed to be environmentally friendly. The house is run by Robert and Brenda Vale, who are architects and professors at Nottingham University. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, and recycle their sewage into compost for their garden. They also heat their house using waste heat from appliances and their own body heat, as well as that of their three children and two cats.
The house looks like a traditional house from the outside, with a clay roof and burnt-orange bricks. But inside, it is very special. The windows are triple-glazed and filled with a special gas called krypton, which makes it very quiet inside. The house is also super-insulated, which means it stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
The Vales designed the house to be low-tech and easy to maintain. They wanted to show that it's possible to live in a house that is good for the environment without sacrificing comfort. They don't have a dishwasher or a washing machine, but they do have a composting toilet and a rainwater tank.
The house is very energy-efficient and uses very little electricity. In fact, it only uses about 9 units of electricity a day, which is much less than most houses. The Vales are planning to install solar panels soon, which will generate even more electricity.
The house is also very warm in the winter. The Vales only use a small wood-burning stove, and they claim it's not necessary to use it except in the coldest winter nights. The room temperature is usually around 18°C, which is comfortable and cozy.
The Vales' house is a great example of how we can live in a way that is good for the environment without sacrificing comfort. It's a simple and low-tech solution that anyone can adopt."

He wrote an article and published the photos, saying that fairies were magical creatures. Later, in 1939, the two ladies who took the photos admitted that they were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them among the flowers. The pictures are still beautiful, but it shows that photography is not always honest. We can now use computer software to change our digital pictures, so it's not true that photography was once completely honest. From the start, cameras have been changing what we see.

Blacksmiths have always been important people throughout history. They make things like tools and weapons from iron. In the past, blacksmiths were very skilled and respected. They were like doctors and astrologers. They even made beautiful decorations for important buildings like St Paul's Cathedral.
However, blacksmiths became less important in the 1960s because factories didn't need them anymore. But now, there is a new interest in decorative architecture and interior design. This means that blacksmiths are needed again.
The British Artist Blacksmiths Association is having an exhibition to show off the work of its members. The exhibition has over 250 pieces, including bookends and a spiral staircase. The prices start at £90 and go up to four figures. The money raised will go to the blacksmiths and also help promote good ironwork.
The blacksmiths are very creative and enjoy working with iron. They like that it's soft when it's hot, but hard when it's cold. One blacksmith, Ann Catrin Evans, makes door-knockers and handles that look like things you might see in a horror movie. She likes the way iron feels strong and permanent.
Iron has been used for decoration for a long time, and it will probably continue to be used for a long time. As long as people don't get tired of rusty candlesticks, that is!"

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very upset. ""Why didn't you stop smoking a long time ago?"" she asked. I couldn't explain why I suddenly stopped smoking one day. I went to a stop-smoking session, which was a combination of group therapy and hypnosis. It was two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who didn't smoke, and I thought I was healthy because I had low blood pressure and a long-living family. I didn't cough or feel unwell, and I got over colds easily.
I went to the session to write an article about people trying to stop smoking. I said I wouldn't be trying to stop myself because I was just writing about it. The counselor looked at me strangely. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was filled with smoke. But when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to. I think what happened was that the idea of stopping smoking made sense to me. It was like a challenge to overcome. The thought of not smoking made me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that was just between me and myself.
It was easy to stop smoking. The physical cravings went away after a few days. I was surprised that I didn't have any problems working without cigarettes. The only thing that was hard was doing nothing on weekends. I think I smoked because it was something to do when I was bored. I do miss my cigarettes a little, but not too much. I have to get used to new situations, like eating out or waiting for a plane."

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won the Nobel Prize. She was a remarkable woman who made many important discoveries in science. But, surprisingly, not many people in the UK know about her. This is strange because if a writer or artist had achieved something similar, they would be well-known.
I've been asking my friends and acquaintances about Dorothy Hodgkin, and most of them don't know who she is. When I tell them I'm writing a biography about her, they often say ""There must be one already!"" But there isn't.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a pioneering scientist who worked in a field called crystallography. She was very good at it and made many important discoveries. Her work helped us understand the structure of important molecules like penicillin and insulin.
But Dorothy Hodgkin was also a person with a family and personal life. She had three children and was married to a historian. Her personal life is not directly related to her work, but it's interesting to see how she balanced her scientific career with her family life.
Many people think that scientists are boring and don't lead interesting lives. But this is not true. Scientists, like artists and writers, have their own stories and struggles. They are people too, with their own passions and interests.
Unfortunately, scientists often don't talk about their personal lives, which can make them seem distant and unapproachable. But this is changing. More scientists are now sharing their stories and experiences with the public.
The book I'm writing about Dorothy Hodgkin is an attempt to make science more accessible and interesting to a wider audience. I believe that people can learn from her life and achievements, and that her story can inspire others to pursue careers in science.

Margaret Wilkins is a woman with a special talent. She can find water using a simple forked hazel stick. She and her husband run a business drilling wells, but Margaret's unique ability helps them locate water more accurately. Their success rate is over 90%. Dowsing, or finding water, is a mysterious skill that some people have. There are different theories about how it works, but Margaret thinks it's because everything on Earth vibrates, and she can sense these vibrations.
Margaret's customers are mostly farmers whose wells have dried up. She also works with people building holiday homes and golf courses. She tries to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She needs to make sure the water is safe and clean, and that there's no risk of pollution. After she finds a likely spot, she uses her hazel stick to pinpoint the exact location.
Margaret holds the stick in her hands and feels a strange sensation when she's above water. The stick starts to rise when it's above water, and she uses this to guide the drilling. Her husband also dowses, and they usually agree on the spot to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they find a spot they both agree on.
Many people have studied Margaret's ability, and they call it an ""intuitive perception of the environment"". It's hard to explain, but it helps her find water accurately. Without this skill, her business wouldn't be successful.

Have you ever wanted to try a different job for a day? Four people did just that and told us about their experiences.
Amanda, a young mother of two, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a waitress at a big restaurant in London. Amanda had never worked in a place like that before. It was very busy and noisy, and she had to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. She was a bit embarrassed when she spilled some drinks, but the other waitresses laughed and said it's normal to make mistakes. Amanda was surprised at how tiring the job was and how much she missed her children.
Cindy, on the other hand, swapped lives with Rosemary, a farmer. Cindy had to take care of two young children and do all the household chores. She was surprised at how exhausting it was to look after the children and how much responsibility it was. She enjoyed the day, but was glad to get back to her normal job.
Rosemary swapped lives with Hilary, a teacher. Rosemary had to get up early and teach a class of 400 students. She was surprised at how much work teachers do and how little time they have to eat. She also had to help with a nature project and a sports event. She was tired by the end of the day and was glad to get back to her farm.
Hilary swapped lives with Rosemary and had to work on the farm. She helped with milking the cows and feeding the animals. She was surprised at how much work it takes to run a farm and how little time Rosemary had off. She missed her students and the social interaction she had as a teacher.
All four people learned that their jobs are not as easy as they thought and that they appreciate their own jobs more after trying something new."

Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player from Sweden. He didn't grow up in a musical family, but he started playing the trumpet at a young age. His parents gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present when he was eight years old. He was very good at playing it and his teacher, Bo Nilsson, was impressed. Nilsson was a trumpet player himself and he taught Hakan how to play.
Hakan's parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player. They even let him go to Paris to study with a famous trumpet teacher, Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud thought Hakan was very good, but he didn't think he should play in an orchestra. Instead, Hakan should focus on being a solo artist.

Hakan is a humble person and doesn't like to talk about his talent. He thinks that if he tries to explain it, he might ruin it. He just knows that music has the power to move people and that's what matters.

**Being a Good Leader**
What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires and motivates others. It's not about being tall or smart, but about being enthusiastic and confident. A good leader should be able to speak clearly and persuasively.
Many people have the potential to be leaders, but they may not know it. The key is to recognize and develop your strengths. We all have the ability to lead, but it's about finding the right situation to do so.
Think about your past bosses. The best ones motivated and supported you, while the worst ones made you feel unimportant and kept secrets from you. Good leaders make things happen through others, while managers just follow rules.
Leaders and managers are different. Managers work within set boundaries, while leaders create their own goals. A good leader can transform an organization, while a good manager can keep it running smoothly.
If you want to improve your leadership skills, here are some tips:
* Find your passions and convictions and act on them.
* Think of yourself as a leader and recognize your abilities.
* Be willing to take risks and learn from mistakes.
* Learn to delegate, motivate, and communicate effectively.
* Don't assume everyone will like your leadership style, and be open to feedback.
* Be visible and accessible to your team, but know when to step back and let others take the lead.
Remember, leadership is not something that happens overnight. It takes practice, patience, and self-awareness to become a good leader."

This film is a thriller about a group of people who try to rescue a submarine. It's like a Cold War movie. The actors do a good job, but the story is not very original. The special effects and the way the film was made are impressive, but the characters and dialogue could be better.
**B. The Thin Red Line**
This film is about a war. It's based on a book by James Jones. There are two versions of the film, one by Andrew Marton and one by Terrence Malick. Marton's version is more traditional, while Malick's version is more artistic. Both films have their good points, but Malick's version is more complex.
**C. On Guard**
This film is a swashbuckling adventure. It's loosely based on a book by Paul Feval. The film has a good villain and a hero who is fun to watch. The film-makers use a lot of costume drama clichés, but they do it in a fun way.
**D. Character**
This film is a drama about a man who is a bailiff in Rotterdam in the early 20th century. The film is very detailed, but it's a bit slow and the story is not very interesting.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This film is a classic western by Sergio Leone. It's been remastered for video and sounds great. The story is cruel and the music is fantastic. The three main characters are all unscrupulous, so it's hard to tell who is good or bad.
**F. The Longest Day**
This film is a war epic with many famous actors and 23,000 extras. It's a big production, but it's too long and some parts are boring. It's better to watch it on a big screen, not on video.

The future of newspapers is uncertain. Some people think that newspapers will soon disappear, but others believe that they will continue to exist in some form. The truth is that the way people read newspapers is changing. More and more people are reading newspapers online, but this does not mean that print newspapers will disappear completely.
In fact, many newspapers are still popular and profitable. The numbers show that while some newspapers are losing readers, others are gaining. For example, some newspapers in Asia are selling more copies than ever before.
People also read books and magazines, and these are also popular. Some people buy e-books, but many still prefer to read physical books. In fact, the sales of physical books have not dropped much.
Some people think that young people are not interested in reading newspapers, but this is not true. Many young people still read newspapers, and some even prefer to read them in print.
Newspaper companies are trying to adapt to the changing way people read. They are creating websites and offering online subscriptions. However, it is not easy to make money from online advertising, and many newspapers are struggling to survive.

**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. When there's someone in the picture, it's usually more interesting than a picture without people. However, people can be difficult to photograph well. You need to think about their actions, gestures, and expressions. And sometimes, the camera can make them act strangely.
**Group Shots**
When taking a group photo, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front to make it easier to see everyone's faces.
**Posing for Pictures**
People often act stiff when taking a photo. To relax them, suggest they find a comfortable position. You can also tell them to put their hands in their pockets or fold their arms.
**Approaching the Subject**
Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you are. This can make the person feel uncomfortable. Most people are happy to have their picture taken and are flattered. But they might feel self-conscious, so you may need to guide them.
**Eye Contact**
A picture is more interesting if the subject looks directly at the camera. Ask them to look at the lens, but not necessarily smile. This can be a challenge, so remind them just before you take the picture.
**Candid Concentration**
Another way to take a good picture is to have the subject focus on something in the picture. This can be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their attention to another part of the picture.
**Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures can tell us a lot about the person in the picture. A happy child can make us smile, while a sad expression can make us feel sorry for them.
**Background and Situation**
The background or environment can add interest to a picture. Try to exclude details that are not relevant to the subject. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
**Interaction**
When taking pictures of people interacting, look for contact between them, such as eye contact or physical touch. This can create a more interesting picture.
**People and Places**
When taking pictures of people in a place, use a standard or wide-angle lens to show the background. Ask the subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so that they are in the foreground.
**To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear picture, you can ask the subject to pose. But if you want a more natural picture, try to capture the moment as it happens."

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. She creates paintings that look like real things. She doesn't like to talk about herself, but she agreed to be interviewed by Joanna Watt.
Sarah doesn't think the artist is important. She thinks the work is what matters. She is humble and doesn't like to brag about her skills. In fact, she would rather you think her paintings paint themselves.
Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for 16 years. She learned drawing and illustration at art school and worked in a publishing house. But she didn't like illustrating, so she started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to do one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that's when she knew she wanted to do it full-time.
Sarah is very good at observing details, which is important for trompe-l'oeil. She says that no one can teach you how to do it - you just have to practice and observe. She is still learning and doesn't think she has mastered it yet.
Sarah is honest about her mistakes. She says she can't paint bread, and it always looks like concrete. She is also honest about her math skills - she got confused when she had to calculate measurements for a big commission.
Sarah's work is very good, and she has many clients who appreciate her talent. She likes to work with clients and get to know them. She says that trompe-l'oeil has to be personal to the client and that she loves the interaction with them.

**Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success**
In the past, people were judged by how smart they were and how well they did in school. But now, things are changing. Employers are looking for more than just intelligence and skills. They want to know how well we work with others and how we handle our emotions.
This is because the way we work is changing. We are no longer just individual workers, but team players. We need to be able to work well with others and understand their feelings. This is what we call emotional intelligence.
Emotional intelligence is not just about being nice or friendly. It's about being able to control your own emotions and understand the emotions of others. It's about being able to work together with others to achieve a common goal.
Many companies are now recognizing the importance of emotional intelligence. They are teaching their employees how to develop these skills. This is because emotional intelligence is essential for success in any job, no matter what the job is.
The good news is that emotional intelligence can be learned. We can develop these skills as we grow and learn from our experiences. This is especially important in today's job market, where job security is not guaranteed.
In short, emotional intelligence is not a magic formula for success. But it is an essential skill for anyone who wants to be successful in their job and work well with others."

""Should the media use photos they didn't take? With smartphones, it's easy to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed the way we share news. Journalists now use social media to get images quickly. Some journalists use photos taken by ordinary people without asking permission. This is a problem because some people think it's not fair. Even though there are rules that say it's okay to use photos without permission in special cases, people still argue about whether this is right. Many people would take photos or videos of news events. This means that photos taken by ordinary people will be important for the media in the future.

Acupuncture is an old Chinese treatment that is over 2,000 years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which includes many different ways to heal, like using herbs, massage, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many different health problems, but doctors in the West are most interested in its use for pain relief.
Traditional Chinese medicine thinks that our body has energy, called Qi, that flows through our body. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, we can get sick or feel pain. An acupuncturist tries to find where the Qi is blocked and uses special needles to help it flow again.
There are over 300 points on the body where the needles are inserted. The points are not always near the part of the body that hurts. People often feel a gentle, tingling sensation when the needle is inserted. This shows that the needle has reached the Qi.
Some doctors in the West have studied acupuncture and found that it can work for pain relief. They think that it might work because it can block pain signals to the brain or release natural pain-relieving substances.
Acupuncture is used to treat many types of pain, such as back pain, headaches, and arthritis. It's often used when other treatments don't work.
In China, acupuncture is used during surgery to help patients feel less pain. This has helped some doctors outside of China to take acupuncture seriously. In China, acupuncture is used for many different types of surgery, including heart surgery.
Some people find acupuncture helpful, but it's not always effective for everyone. Acupuncturists say that it usually takes several visits to feel real relief, but some people feel better after just a few visits.
Acupuncturists view pain in a different way than Western medicine. They look at the whole person, not just the pain. They want to know what's causing the pain and how it's affected by things like the weather or stress.
Some doctors have traditional acupuncture training, while others don't believe in the traditional Chinese theory. It's important to choose an acupuncturist who is qualified and will refer you to a doctor if necessary."

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. She is known for her clever and imaginative stories. At first, you might think she is a strict teacher because she looks serious. But she is actually a shy person. She says that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is like her if she were a man. Dalgliesh is a detective who likes to solve crimes on his own, just like P.D. James.
P.D. James likes to write in private and doesn't like distractions. She is very proud of her work, but she doesn't think she is the best crime writer in Britain. She likes reading books by her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James also likes books by other women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner.
P.D. James didn't become a famous writer until later in her life. She was 42 when her first crime novel was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband at university and loves the city, which is why she set one of her novels there.
P.D. James had a difficult life. Her husband came back from the war very sick, and she had to work hard to support their two daughters. She worked in administration for the National Health Service and later for the Home Office. She was good at her job and was in charge of five clinics. She also worked in the police department and the juvenile crime division.
P.D. James didn't write about her own life in her books. She wanted to write detective stories because they are a good way to practice writing and they are different from her own life. She thinks that writing detective stories is a way to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime is like proving that life is important, even if it's not always easy."

The study of handwriting can reveal a person's character. In some countries, people are asked to write a sample of their handwriting when applying for a job. This is because handwriting can say a lot about a person's personality, health, and even their potential. Many companies hire experts to analyze handwriting to help them choose the right candidates for certain jobs.
Patricia Marne, a professional handwriting analyst, believes that handwriting can be a useful tool. She says that it can show whether someone is honest, clever, or has a good or bad character. She also claims that it can predict whether someone might commit a crime or have mental health issues.
According to Ms. Marne, handwriting can reveal many things, such as whether someone is sensitive, confident, or artistic. She believes that it can even predict whether someone will have health problems, such as heart or lung issues.
However, not everyone agrees with Ms. Marne. Some doctors and psychologists think that handwriting is just a result of how someone was taught to write and has no special meaning.

A new survey says that a happy and healthy workforce needs fresh air and good chairs. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had a team of experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here's what they thought:
Office A: This office is very simple. It doesn't have central heating or air conditioning, and the windows open directly onto the street. But the people who work here are a small, friendly team, and they seem happy. They adapt to the changing weather by opening doors and windows or turning on heaters. This might be the secret to their happiness: they have created a cozy and homely working environment, and they don't have to deal with a lot of rules.
Office B: This office is comfortable and well-maintained. The air is good, and the staff like it. They have a no-smoking policy, which helps. The chairs are good, and the lighting and computers are also good. However, the office is a bit boring and uninteresting, with grey walls.
Office C: This office is a mixed bag. It's a bit like being in a museum, with rows of desks and chairs. The air is good, even when there are smokers around. The staff are happy and supportive, and they like the technology they use. The office could be improved if the desks were arranged better to make it easier to share information.
Office D: This office is a bit of a mess. The air-conditioning doesn't work well, and the space is cluttered. The desks are small, and the chairs are old and uncomfortable. The office is also very dusty, and the roof collects dust that falls down when it's disturbed. The staff seem stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to improve the air conditioning and make the office a more pleasant place to work.

Chewing gum is very popular in the United States. People chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. But did you know that chewing gum has a long history? The ancient Greeks chewed a type of gum made from the bark of a special tree. Women especially liked it because it helped keep their teeth clean and fresh.
Later, American colonists started chewing a type of gum made from the resin that forms on spruce trees. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the United States.
In the late 1800s, people discovered a new type of gum called chicle. It comes from a special tree in Central America. Chicle gum is smooth and elastic, and it's still used today.
However, it's hard to find chicle, so most gum is now made from synthetic materials. This means it's not natural, but it's cheaper and easier to make.
There are still some people who gather chicle, called chicleros. They have a hard job, working in the hot rainforest with snakes and insects around them. They have to climb trees and carry heavy loads to make the gum.
As the demand for gum has increased, manufacturers have found new ways to make it. They add special ingredients to make it taste better and last longer. Some people even claim that chewing gum can help keep your teeth healthy by increasing the flow of saliva in your mouth.
Today, the United States is one of the biggest producers of mint, which is used in many popular chewing gums."

The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown checks hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her at work. The Globe Hotel was her first stop on the annual inspection. Already, things were going wrong. The receptionist was talking to a guest on the phone, but she hadn't noticed Sue and her companion waiting. Sue said, ""This is very poor."" She has been an inspector for 11 years and has seen this mistake many times. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it's one of the best hotels in the country. However, the hotel's entrance was not what Sue expected. The door was unmanned and the corridor was long and empty. ""This is not what I expected,"" she said.
Things got worse. The receptionist couldn't find their booking. It turned out that many of the hotel's rooms were empty that night. Sue didn't like the top-floor room because it was stuffy and had a big hole in the wall. When she started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black"" because she was tough, but she said she wasn't really tough.
The next morning, Sue told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, about all the problems she found. He apologized for the smell in the main lounge and said they would fix it. Sue suggested that the hotel should also improve the way they welcome guests. Greaves took notes and looked unhappy. He had only been working at the hotel for five months and didn't want to hear that his hotel was not perfect.
However, Sue also found some good things. The assistant manager, Emma, and the waitress, Trudy, were very helpful. The food was also good, which meant the hotel could keep its two-rosette rating. Greaves asked Sue how to get three rosettes, and she said they should make sure their desserts don't collapse. Greaves looked unhappy again.
Sue's job is to tell hotel owners about the problems she finds. Sometimes, hotel owners don't like what she says and make false accusations. Sue gets many complaints and it hurts her feelings. She has to write a report about her findings and give it to the hotel owner. The hotel has to pay for the report, but it's worth it because it helps them improve. Greaves was relieved to hear that Sue wouldn't take away the hotel's red stars, but he was worried about another inspector coming to check on them soon."

I, Doug Scott, share my adventures climbing the highest mountains on each continent. I'll tell you about my journey, in the order I climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
We were in a snow cave, 91m below the summit, when my friend Dougal started talking to our guide about sleeping bags. I thought this was strange, as we were alone. Later, I found myself talking to my feet! The cold was getting into my toes, and I worried about frostbite. We were lucky to have each other and made it to the summit.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
This mountain is known for being the most challenging. We climbed in ""alpine style"", carrying all our gear and food. It was tough, but we made it to the summit.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
We got lost in the jungle on our way to the mountain. We found some arrows and a trail of rubbish, which led us to a rock pool. We took a different route to the summit, which was surreal.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
We joined a group climbing via the Polish Glacier. We decided to skip the glacier and take a shorter route. The wind was strong, but we made it to the summit.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
We guided a team to climb Vinson Massif, which helped us finance our trip. The weather was harsh, with strong winds and cold temperatures, but we reached the summit.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
Our team assembled in St Petersburg and climbed Elbrus by cableway. We walked to the refuge and then to the summit, which was a long and windy journey.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
We climbed Carstensz Pyramid, hoping to establish a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. We were warned about bandits, but we were not deterred. We reached the summit and were given a standing ovation.

Susan Shepherd is a famous artist who loves to paint flowers. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, like tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path are very beautiful, with a mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is because the previous owners of the house were good gardeners and left many plants that Susan likes. She also inherited a gardener named Danny, who helps her take care of the garden.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. She takes a flower, paints it, and then brings in another one to add to the painting. It can take a long time to finish a painting, sometimes even a couple of years. In the spring and early summer, she is very busy painting tulips and poppies.
Susan has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wildflowers when she was a student and didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake. Now, she has plants from all over the world in her garden. She doesn't mind if the plants grow a bit wild and lets her children play in the garden without worrying too much about the mess.
Susan has two exhibitions coming up and has been busy painting. She has hired an extra gardener to help her take care of the garden, but she knows that to stay inspired, she needs to get her hands dirty.

Many big trees in the Brackham area fell down during a strong storm in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This changed the way the town looked, and some people didn't like it. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the police force, was not happy about it. But he was not well at the time. He had bronchitis, a bad cold, and was in bed.
Pelham's wife, Molly, wanted him to go to the doctor, but he didn't listen. He thought the police force needed him, so he kept working. This made him feel worse. It took his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, to take him to the doctor. The doctor gave him medicine, and he started to feel a little better.
When Pelham woke up on Saturday, he felt better and realized that the big walnut tree in his garden was gone. He was surprised and a bit sad. The tree had made his living room look nice, but now it was gone. The room looked very bright and the old furniture looked old and worn out. The house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible and looked ugly.
Pelham didn't like the way it looked and asked his wife, Molly, if she thought it was terrible. But Molly said that she had been telling him for a long time that they needed to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.

We had been living in our valley for 16 months when we realized that the hills around us could be a danger to our safety. It was an unusual year with early snow and strong winds. The snow was deep and blocked our path, making it slippery and dangerous. But we were more worried about the river, the Ryburn. It was usually calm, but we remembered that many years ago, the flow of water from the hills was controlled by dams. When the snow started to melt, we saw dark clouds gathering over the hills. The river began to rise, and we watched as it became wilder and fuller every day. The reservoir was filling up fast, and we were worried. Then, for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. The water rushed down the stream, making it deeper and wilder than ever before. We were relieved when the dam held, and the water started to go back down. We had learned that the dam was important because it stopped the river from flooding the villages nearby. Now, we can enjoy the big clouds and the power of the river without worrying about our safety.

I've been a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page for ten years. Before this, I did some reviews for other newspapers, magazines, and radio stations. I met Tom Seaton, the arts editor, who hired me. He had a plan to have a team of critics for different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would meet once a week to discuss what to review, and there would be guests to make it a social event. It was a new newspaper, and I was excited to be part of the team.
However, the team idea didn't work out, and we ended up working individually. People preferred to associate a reviewer with one specific area, so I chose film. I like my current job, where I write a weekly article about one film. It gives me the freedom to think deeply about the movie and make my own arguments.
Some people might wonder what my role is in the public arena. Do people choose which movies to see based on the stars, the trailer, or the director? Sometimes, people go to see a movie because of their favorite actor or because they like a certain type of film. Rarely do people change their minds about a movie because of a review.
As a film critic, I don't feel responsible for being right or wrong about a movie. My job is to make an argument about the film, not to decide whether it's good or bad. I'm not a judge, and I wouldn't want to be."

A 17-year-old girl named Melanie loves sports. She wants to find a training partner who is also good at swimming, cycling, and running long distances. Melanie is very good at these sports and wants to be an Olympic champion one day. She has been doing triathlons for three years and has already won some competitions.
Melanie says that doing triathlons is fun, but it's not easy. She has to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. After the swim, she gets out of the water and jumps on her bike, which is still wet. Then she has to cycle 40 kilometers and finally run 10 kilometers when she's very tired. But she enjoys it and thinks it's worth the effort.
Melanie started doing triathlons when she was 14 and won the junior section. She was so confident that she entered the National Championships, but she didn't do as well as she expected. She made a mistake and cycled 20 kilometers too far. She was very disappointed, but she didn't give up. She kept training and is now one of the top junior triathletes in Europe.
Melanie's coach, Steve, is very impressed with her determination. He says that she works very hard and never gives up, even when she's tired. Melanie wants to improve her cycling skills, so she's asking her parents to buy her a new bike. She also wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon.
Melanie doesn't have much time for her social life because she trains very hard. She doesn't like going to parties and would rather sleep after a long training session. She stays in touch with her friends through phone calls and letters, and they talk about their training and how they're doing.
Melanie is very focused on her goal to become an Olympic champion, and she's willing to work hard to achieve it."

I love collecting things and so do many other people. In fact, one in three adults enjoys collecting. It's a world of passion, excitement, and joy. But remember, only collect things you truly love. People have been collecting things for a long time. In the past, people collected stones and seashells because they liked their shapes and colors. I have been collecting things all my life. I collect flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was of stones I found in my parents' garden.
When I was a child, my parents took me to a museum in a small town in England. I was fascinated by the objects on display. I'm not the only one who loves collecting things. Many people collect things for different reasons. Some people collect because it's the only thing they have complete control over. For me, collecting is just something I enjoy doing.
There are many famous collectors throughout history. One example is the Duc de Berry in France, who had a collection of strange and interesting objects. Another example is Catherine the Great of Russia, who collected over 4,000 paintings. You don't have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I've collected things like tulip bulbs and china cups, and I searched for them with great enthusiasm.
I once had a collection of 350 American rag dolls. I looked all over the USA for them, and I was very happy to add each new one to my collection. Unfortunately, my house caught fire and my collection was destroyed. It was very sad.
What I find interesting is how collections change hands and become more valuable. A spoon that once belonged to a king or a famous poet can be very valuable. As people start to collect certain items, their value increases. Even old toys from the 1950s can be valuable now, as long as you kept the original boxes.

The owners, the Malseeds, bought the house and made some changes, but they did it quietly. Our friend Strafe found the house. He saw an advertisement and showed it to us. We had gone on holiday the year before, but it wasn't good because the food was bad. We've been friends for a long time, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me, Milly. Dekko got his nickname at school, and Strafe did too. We're all around the same age and live near each other.
When we arrived at Glencorn Lodge, Mrs Malseed was waiting for us in the big hall. She always knows when we're coming. She showed us to our rooms, which were named after flowers. In the winter, when it's quiet, she likes to add little touches, like painting flowers on the doors. Mr Malseed, her husband, takes care of the decorations and repairs.
When we got to the hall, Mr Malseed greeted us with a big smile and said ""A hundred thousand welcomes"" in the Irish way. We felt like we were really on holiday. We went to our rooms, had dinner, and played cards for a bit. There were other people staying at the lodge, including a man and a French couple. We could see some of them walking around the gardens or going down to the beach.

Later, one of Michael's friends suggested they go back up to the roof and jump again. This time, Michael was the only one left, and his friends were calling him to come down. But Michael was scared and couldn't make himself jump. He was thinking about how it didn't seem so scary the first time. His friends started to get impatient and left him alone on the roof.

Are you not happy in your job? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. If you want to change your job, you can talk to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write about your life and then do some tests. The tests show what you are good at and what you like. The adviser will then give you some suggestions for new jobs and what training you might need.
I tried out Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The tests were like my science exams at school. I had to answer questions quickly and remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The tests asked me to find mistakes and match shapes. Then I talked to an adviser and they made a report with their observations and suggestions. I agreed with most of what they said, but I was surprised to find out I didn't do well in the scientific and practical tests.
You don't have to make a big change to rethink your career. Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager and went to Career Analysts for help. She wanted to think about her career and what she liked. The results were surprising - she had a talent for design! But she had to think about the cost of training and her financial situation.
Other people have also found Career Analysts helpful. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and decided to change her career. She took some tests and had four sessions with an adviser. The tests showed she liked sciences, and after the last session, she decided to study geology and start a degree course.
Not everyone finds career advice helpful, though. Amanda Margetts, 24, went to Career Counselling Services, but she didn't find it very useful. She thought the adviser would suggest something new, but the advice was similar to what she already knew. She felt like she could have talked to a friend and got the same advice.

'Is the Dentist's a Fun Place to Visit? 
Dr. W. Lloyd Jerome runs a dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow. His surgery is modern and has bright paintings on the walls. Patients sit on a blue couch while he checks their teeth. Dr. Jerome says that many people only go to the dentist when they have a problem with their teeth, not for regular check-ups. He thinks this is because they are afraid. To make people feel more comfortable, he has created a relaxing atmosphere. He doesn't wear a white coat, which some people associate with pain. He believes that dental treatment should be enjoyable and relaxing.
Dr. Jerome has introduced some new techniques to help patients feel more at ease. One of these is using virtual reality headsets. Patients wear the headsets during their initial check-up and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Dr. Jerome examines their teeth. The headsets also show a special camera tour of their mouth. Many patients enjoy this part of their visit.
The surgery also has a pleasant smell, like a perfume shop. Dr. Jerome wants patients to feel that they are not at a typical dentist's office. He takes his work very seriously and uses special instruments to clean teeth, which makes the process less painful. He believes that making patients feel comfortable is important for both the patient and the dentist.
Dr. Jerome has even introduced a special way of cleaning teeth that uses warm water instead of scraping. He also offers patients a choice of tea and asks them what video they would like to watch while they are in the chair. The surgery feels like a luxurious beauty parlour, not a typical dentist's office.'

Chocolate is a popular treat that comes from South America. Today, it's a big business worth millions of pounds. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. It's a time when eight per cent of all chocolate is sold. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.
The history of chocolate goes back over 3,000 years to the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilisations in Central America. They grew the cacao tree, which is a tropical plant found in many parts of the world. The fruit of the tree has 20-40 seeds, which are called cacao beans. These beans are used to make chocolate.
In the past, the Aztecs used cacao beans as money and to make a special drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in their language. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar. Chocolate houses were popular in Europe's capital cities, where people would gather to drink chocolate.
In the 19th century, a Dutch inventor created chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. Later, a British company called Fry and Sons created the first chocolate bars. A Swiss company added milk to the process, making milk chocolate. Today, many chocolate companies are looking for new ways to attract customers, such as making chocolate-flavored ice cream and soft drinks.
Unfortunately, many small-scale cacao farmers struggled when cocoa bean prices dropped in the 1980s. As a result, many were forced to stop farming. Next time you eat a chocolate bar, remember the farmers who work hard to grow the beans."

Peter Cooke is 83 years old and has become very good at making things out of shells. He has been doing it for 10 years and is very happy with what he does. He shows me around his apartment and points out some of his creations. He says, ""If you think I'm boring, just tell me!"" But he's not boring - he's very enthusiastic and his work is beautiful.
Peter started making shell objects by accident. Some friends came to visit him and said, ""You should have an exhibition!"" So he did, and 70% of his work was sold. Now he has a new exhibition with 86 pieces, and the prices are quite high - up to £2,000 for some of the ornaments. But Peter doesn't care about the prices; he just wants to make beautiful things.
Peter uses shells to make all sorts of things, like flowers, pictures, and baskets. He has his own way of doing things and uses materials he finds, like cardboard and glue. He even travels to different countries to find the most beautiful shells. He only collects dead shells and doesn't hurt the environment. He says, ""Why should I not collect shells if people are breaking them up anyway?""
Peter wishes he had started doing this sooner, but he's happy with what he's accomplished. He's very proud of his work and wants to keep making more beautiful things."

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old model. When she's not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she's probably studying for her school exams. I went to an agency to meet her and was told she would be late. I was worried that she might not show up or be in a bad mood. But when she arrived, she was smiling and friendly with her mother. Kira wasn't wearing fancy clothes, just a simple dress and trainers. She seemed like a normal girl, not a spoiled model.
All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Kira's mother was with her, and she seemed very proud of her daughter. Kira won a model competition by accident. Her older sister entered her without asking, and Kira didn't even want to participate. But she ended up winning and became a model.
Now, Kira has to balance her modeling career with her school life. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are mean and say she's too full of herself. Kira says that's not true. She's just more confident now and can stand up for herself. As a model, she can't make plans with her friends because she might get a job call at any time. But her friends are understanding.
Kira has a great chance of becoming a successful model. She's already done well before she even takes her school-leaving exams. I asked her what she would do if she wasn't a model, and she said she would like to do what I do - be a journalist.

Terence and his son Chris Madden are on a big adventure. They are searching for gold in Wales, a country in the UK. They believe they might find a lot of gold in a mine they are digging on the side of a mountain. After 10 years of searching, they think they are very close to finding a big vein of gold worth five million dollars.
Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find a lot of gold. We just need to dig a little more to get to where it's concentrated."" Terence and Chris have been searching for gold for a long time. They started after Terence read about a place called the 'Dolgellau gold belt', where there is a lot of gold. They chose a good spot to dig and have been working on it for 10 years.
They have spent all their money on the project, so they need to find someone to give them £50,000 to help them finish digging. Chris said, ""It's not looking good right now, but we have some people we can ask for help."" The news about the dig has made people in the area very excited. The town of Dolgellau relies on tourists, and the locals are hoping that if the Maddens find gold, it will bring more tourists to the area.
Gold was very important in Wales in the past, but now there are not many gold mines left. One of the last mines closed recently. However, some people are still searching for gold, like George Hall, who is planning to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill. He said, ""Searching for gold is exciting. It's like finding hidden treasure."""

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She studies the chemical processes that happen in the sea. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater adventures in a special vehicle that's like a small car. She dives down three kilometers to study underwater volcanoes.
The space inside the vehicle is very small, so she can touch the pilots who are with her. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. The dive can take up to 16 hours. If something goes wrong, she can press a button to escape quickly.
Rachel has made six dives so far. She has gone down to the ocean floor with a Russian team to study a special volcano. The volcano is very hot and has black smoke coming out. This is because of the ""black smokers"", which are underwater volcanoes that release hot water and black smoke.
Rachel is very excited to be able to study the black smokers. She has been studying them for three years and was amazed when she first saw them. She feels a sense of wonder every time she looks out the window and sees the volcanoes.

I was tired, hungry, and dirty after my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind needed a break from all the traveling. I said to myself, ""I'll never do this again."" But the next year, I did it again. And the year after that. With my Inter-Rail ticket, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month. I didn't need to worry about finding a hotel or booking a train ticket. I just carried my backpack and slept on the train. It was a strange but exciting way to travel. We didn't plan much, we just went with the flow. We saw many new places, but we didn't always take the time to visit famous landmarks. We were just happy to be on the move and enjoying the journey. Seeing Europe with your own eyes is different from just reading about it or looking at pictures. It's like discovering a new place for the first time. The train trip is a unique experience that helps you understand what Europe is really like. It's a big continent, and Inter-Rail gives you the chance to explore it in your own way.

'Imagine arriving at an airport and finding out that your luggage is missing. This can be very frustrating. You might have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your luggage. If you're traveling to a different climate, you might not have the right clothes. Airlines don't often tell us how many bags they lose, but it's a common problem. Even the best airlines can make mistakes. They can't guarantee that your luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have a connection. 
Airports have a system to handle luggage. Airlines ask you to check in early so that your bag can be loaded onto the plane. They also have minimum connecting times, which are the shortest time it takes to transfer between flights. These times are longer than usual to allow for luggage transfers. Usually, the system works well. But sometimes, flights are delayed due to extra security checks or air traffic problems. This can cause the baggage system to fail. 
There are also human mistakes or accidents that can happen. Large airports, called hubs, can be especially busy and mistakes can happen more often. For example, London's Heathrow airport is very busy and many people transfer planes there. 
To avoid losing your luggage, try to take a direct flight. Check in early and make sure your luggage is labeled correctly. If you have a connection, try to fly with the same airline and allow extra time. If your luggage still goes missing, go to the airline's baggage area and fill out a report before leaving the airport.

Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who loves kingfishers. These beautiful birds live near streams and rivers and eat fish. They have a special blue-green color because of the way their feathers reflect light. Charlie fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He can't explain why, but he finds them very special.
In Greek mythology, the kingfisher was said to be a goddess who turned into a bird. Another story tells how the kingfisher flew so high that its body turned blue from the sky and its belly got hot from the sun. This story is partly true. Kingfishers don't have blue feathers, but their feathers scatter light and make them look blue.
Charlie likes to take pictures of kingfishers from a hiding place. He uses a special blanket to hide behind and waits for the birds to come close. It took him a long time to get a good picture, but he didn't give up. He loves kingfishers so much that he even missed school to be with them. He became a photographer and now makes films about wildlife. His dream is to make a film about kingfishers that doesn't need words, just beautiful pictures.
Charlie is still fascinated by kingfishers and wants to show how much he loves them. He thinks about the colors of their wings and how they shine in the sunlight. His pictures show how much he cares about kingfishers, but he knows that there's more to his love for them than just his work."

If you want to take your children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try out the best ones. Here's what they thought:
Fun Island - The Burns family
We went to Fun Island with our three-year-old. We thought it might be boring compared to a big theme park in the US. But we were surprised. The park is great for young children, so our three-year-old had a lot of fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's even a special ride for very young children. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! We were tired after five hours, but the kids didn't want to leave. We thought the park could improve its atmosphere and scenery, but the staff were very helpful and the park was clean and well-organized.
Wonderland - The McMillan family
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought our little boy might be too young, but he loved it. He loved the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small replicas of famous buildings. The older kids enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were glad there were places to rest. The park is very well-designed and the staff are friendly.
Adventure World - The Jeffree family
After seven hours, we still had a lot to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus and the Terror Line, which was a bit scary for them. They also liked Running River, which is like a river ride. For younger kids, Toy Land is great fun. We were impressed with how well the park is designed, even the queues aren't boring. The park is very clean and the staff are great.
The Great Park - The Langridge family
We went to The Great Park and were a bit disappointed that it only opened until 5 pm. It's a great park for young children, with rides that aren't too scary. Even I, who's a bit scared, had fun. We loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, but it was over before we knew it!
Fantasy World - The Break-all family
Fantasy World has a big roller-coaster called the Rocket, which is the tallest in Europe. Our son thought it was the scariest ride, but our daughter said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down, was even worse! There are many main rides that the older kids went on several times. Our younger child was too small for some of them, but enjoyed the Long Slide. We thought the staff were a bit mixed, some were great with the young children, but not all of them were friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World.

She has four employees and makes over £200,000 a year. Christine says her customers are like friends because she doesn't have to deliver work to them. They come to her instead.

She sells her cards to museums and doesn't advertise. Maggy likes being her own boss and working from home, but sometimes it can be lonely.
C. Delia Turner makes curtains. She started her business eight years ago and it was very successful. She had to lay off her employees when the economy declined, but now she works with a few women who help her from their own homes. Delia has to be careful with her money and prices.
D. Tessa Strickland publishes children's books. She moved to the countryside because it was cheaper and she loves the country. She works with authors and artists from all over the world and has to make phone calls at odd hours. Tessa likes being her own boss and working from home, but it can be hard to shut off work.
E. Meg Rivers makes cakes and runs a shop. She started her business at home and it grew quickly. She now employs six people and makes £250,000 a year. Meg's biggest challenge was getting the financial side of her business right.

Meet the Amazing Watkins Family
The Watkins family is very special because all the sons are musicians. Their dad makes musical instruments. Matthew Rye reports.
It's not common to find a family with musicians, instrument makers, and composers. John and Hetty Watkins, schoolteachers from South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their son Paul when he was 10. But they thought it was too expensive. So, John decided to learn how to make one himself. He took evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for three years.
Paul, now 28, says: 'He made me a cello after a few tries. It was great! He made another one later, and that's the one I used until recently.'
John now makes violins full-time and sells them to famous musicians. Paul and his brother Huw started playing music when they were young. They both played the piano first, but Paul loved the cello. Their dad, who played the viola, thought Paul would be good at the violin, but Paul preferred the cello.
Huw, 22, is now a pianist and composer. Paul won a big music competition with his cello and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played his dad's cello until he got a new one from the Royal Academy of Music.
Paul's dad is proud of him, but he's also happy to see him playing a new cello. Soon, Paul will play Elgar's Cello Concerto on TV, and his brother Huw will premiere his string quartet at the Wigmore Hall. Their parents will have to work hard to keep track of their sons' busy schedules.

The National Trust is a group that works to protect the countryside in the UK. I visited the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talked to Gareth Roberts, a warden who looks after the beautiful areas owned by the Trust.
Gareth says that to be a good warden, you need to have common sense and be good at dealing with people. He works with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies, so it's important to be able to handle different situations.
Gareth grew up on a farm in the area and worked there until he got married. He applied for the warden job because of his local knowledge and farming experience. He didn't have any special training, but he was chosen for the job because of his background.
Gareth says that his farming experience has helped him with the physical demands of the job, like building fences and planting trees. He also understands more about nature conservation now. He used to collect flowers, butterflies, and birds' nests when he was a child, but he realizes now that farming has affected the countryside.
Gareth used to think that farmers and conservationists were against each other, but now they are working together. His job is to make sure projects are finished on time and within budget. He enjoys seeing projects completed and meeting the public, but sometimes he has to deal with difficult people.
Gareth likes his job and enjoys talking to people, but he doesn't like it when people demand things without respecting the environment. If you like the outdoors and have common sense, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. However, there might not be a job available in the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time."

Suzie Ellis interviewed England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. She's been preparing for the World Championships, which will take place next month. Kendra's days are busy - she teaches at a local school and then trains in a car park. She's too focused on her game to notice people staring.
Kendra says her whole life is about getting ready for the Championships. She has a strict schedule to improve her fitness. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 teams participating.
Kendra is excited to have home support, which is special. She wants to improve the reputation of netball in England and make the country proud. The team will face Barbados in their first game, which will be after the opening ceremony. Kendra thinks it will be a tough match, but they have beaten Barbados before.
The World Championships are different from other competitions. There's no rest between games, and you can still win even if you lose the first game. But if you lose, you only get one chance to make it up.
Kendra has been playing netball for 15 years, and the game has become faster and more competitive. Players are more aggressive, but Kendra says they're all friends after the game.
Netball is also using new methods to test fitness. Kendra thinks it's important to be a strong leader and set a good example for her team. She's been planning her netball career carefully and has decided that this will be her last big competition as a player.
At the opening ceremony, Kendra will likely have a tear in her eye. She's proud to be leading her team and is focused on doing her best."

**Special Music Schools for Gifted Children**
When a child shows exceptional musical talent, it can be difficult to know how to help them develop their skills. Many parents may not recognize their child's gift until they start to behave badly because they are frustrated. Regular schools can't always provide the special support that musically gifted children need. This is why specialist music schools were created.
There are five specialist music schools in Britain that offer a special environment for children aged 7-18 to learn and practice music with professional musicians. These schools provide a balance between music lessons and normal school subjects like English, maths, and science. The schools have small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio.
Most students at these schools are boarders, which means they live at the school and attend classes full-time. This helps them focus on their music and make friends with others who share their passion.
However, there are some disadvantages to consider. The schools are expensive, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 per year. Some parents may also worry about sending their child to boarding school at a young age.
Some people think that setting children apart from their peers too early can be stressful and may even cause their musical talent to disappear. The schools try to monitor each student's progress and offer help if needed.
Not all students who attend these schools feel that the academic program is good enough. Some are very intelligent and can handle academic pressure, but feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. It might be better to wait until the child is old enough to make their own decisions about their education.
There are other options for musically gifted children, such as attending a school with a strong music department or taking extra music lessons at a music college. However, these options may not be available for families who live far from major cities."

Susan Shepherd is a famous artist who loves to paint flowers. Her garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are wild and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path are very beautiful, with a mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is because the previous owners of the house were good gardeners and left many plants that Susan likes. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.
Susan focuses on painting individual flowers, not the whole garden. She takes the flowers to her studio and paints them one by one. It can take a few days to finish each painting, and sometimes it takes a few years. In the spring and early summer, she is very busy painting tulips and poppies.
Susan has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers when she was a student and didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. Now, she has plants from all over the world in her garden. She likes to let the plants grow freely, like an aunt who lets her children play freely as long as they don't cause trouble.
Susan is very busy preparing for two upcoming exhibitions, but she knows it's important to spend time in her garden to stay inspired. She now has an extra gardener to help her, but she still likes to get her hands dirty to stay connected to her work.

She likes her job because it's a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down.
Sarah gets up early to walk to the chalet, where she makes breakfast for the guests. She makes sure they have everything they need, like porridge, eggs, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans the rooms or prepares afternoon tea. She loves to ski and usually goes skiing until 4:30 pm.

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet and they go out at night. She usually stays in on Saturday nights because she has to work early on Sundays.
On Sundays, Sarah works harder than usual. She cleans the chalet and prepares breakfast for the new guests. She also does the shopping if she didn't do it on Saturday. In the evening, she prepares tea for the new guests and helps them with their ski equipment.

Are you trying to get your writing published? Margaret Stubbs is here to help. Many people write to us asking, ""Where should I send my story?"" Before you start, you need to know about the publishing industry and improve your writing skills. To do this, read widely and research the market. Look for books and magazines that are similar to what you want to write. Visit your local library and bookshops to find out what's popular.
It's also important to keep up-to-date with new publications and changes in the industry. Publishers are always looking for new writers, but you need to make sure you're writing what they want. If you're not sure what you want to write about, start by reading different types of stories and magazines. For example, if you like writing love stories, find out which magazines publish them and read recent issues.
Some writers send me their work and ask if it's any good. As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone, but most new writers are not ready to be published yet. It's better to keep writing and improving your skills before sending your work out. When you do send your work, don't stop writing. Keep writing more stories and articles, and each one will be better than the last. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and don't show your work to others until you're sure it's ready.
Remember, every successful writer has had many rejections before they became successful. To improve your writing, consider taking a creative writing course or joining a local writers' group. Think of yourself as a writer and make writing a part of your daily routine."

I was waiting for my train at Baltimore railway station. It was a busy day, and the station was full of people. I was leaning against a pillar, watching everyone, when I saw a well-dressed man talking to people. He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia, and then he moved on to ask another person. I was curious about him, so I listened as he talked to more people. He was looking for someone who was going to Philadelphia, but nobody seemed to be going there.
I was going to Philadelphia myself, but he didn't ask me. I think he didn't ask me because I didn't look like someone who could help him. He was getting more and more worried as he talked to people. Finally, he found a woman who was going to Philadelphia, and he asked her for a favour. He told her that his daughter was flying out of Philadelphia and had forgotten her passport. He had sent his daughter to the station with her passport, but then he realized that he had left the passport at home. He asked the woman if she could take the passport to his daughter.
The woman was kind and offered to help. She asked him why he didn't go to the station himself, but he said his wife was in a wheelchair and he couldn't leave her alone. I didn't think this was a good excuse, and I thought the man was trying to trick the woman. I was watching him closely, and I noticed that he was holding a padded envelope. I thought it might be important, so I was careful.

My son Gary is a famous TV chef. I, John Moore, am his father and the owner of a restaurant. I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son got his chance with cooking, and I got the chance to run a restaurant. When I saw the restaurant, it was in a bad state, but I saw an opportunity. It reminded me of my childhood when my mother worked in a factory and I was left alone. I wanted to make sure my family had time together. My wife helped with the children and the accounts, and I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant and had meals together. This helped our children, Gary and Joe, become confident. They would talk to our regular customers from a young age.
Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into the bath like a pool and knocked himself out. He started working for pocket money when he was older and was very disciplined. He would get up early and help out in the kitchen. He wasn't good at schoolwork, but he was amazing in the kitchen. By the time he was 15, he was as good as the other chefs, and sometimes he was even in charge. He produced over 100 meals, and I knew he would go into catering.
Gary recently started playing the drums and has his own band. I told him to focus on one thing at a time, as chasing two things can mean you don't achieve anything. He went to catering college at 17 and was very good. On his first day, he finished all his work in an hour, which was impressive. Now, his TV cookery series is very successful, and I'm very proud of him. I always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. He's taken the opportunity he was given and worked hard to succeed."

Finding a flat in Dublin that you could afford was very difficult. Jo had just moved to Dublin and didn't know anyone who could help her find a place to live. She had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat on her own. Jo was feeling a bit scared and unsure about living in a big city like Dublin. She didn't really know why she was moving there, but everyone at school thought it would be a good idea. 
Jo's parents were worried about her living in a hostel, but she wanted to find a flat of her own. She saw an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that seemed too good to be true. It had its own room, TV, and shared kitchen and bathroom. Jo really hoped it would be nice and not too expensive. 
When Jo arrived at the flat, she met two girls, Nessa and Pauline. Nessa was wearing a college scarf, and Pauline had bright pink hair and a colorful shirt. They were friendly and invited Jo to have a cup of tea. They told Jo that they didn't like the previous tenant, who was very snooty. They said they would let Jo know if they could stay in the flat."

People love dolphins. They are very intelligent and can understand human emotions. We see them in movies and TV shows, but their situation is actually very serious. According to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, their numbers are decreasing.
Dolphins have a special place in our hearts. They are known for their intelligence and ability to communicate with humans. However, this love affair is not entirely true. The reality is that dolphins are struggling in the polluted and overfished oceans of the 20th century.
The population of North Sea harbour porpoises has decreased by up to 89,000. You might expect these popular animals to be protected by law and cared for in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and it may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.
There are 40 different types of dolphins worldwide. In European waters, the most common ones are the striped, common, bottlenose, and harbour porpoise dolphins. The first two are usually found far out at sea and are rarely seen. The bottlenose and harbour porpoise dolphins, on the other hand, used to be common near European coasts. They are now mostly found in Scotland and Wales, and they show signs of stress.
It's difficult to determine the exact reason for the decline in dolphin numbers. Overfishing, which is reducing the world's fish stocks and threatening local fishing industries, also affects porpoises and dolphins. Dolphins need to find food quickly, and if fish in one area are removed, they may not survive to find food elsewhere. They are also at risk of getting caught in fishermen's nets, which are often invisible to them.
In recent years, many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornish beaches, with signs of injury from being caught in nets. Dolphins can also store waste and pollutants in their bodies, which can be harmful to them. For example, pesticides can build up in their fat and be passed on to their babies through their milk. There have already been cases of young dolphins being poisoned by their mother's milk.
Human disturbance is another major threat to dolphins. They live in groups and communicate through sound, and noise pollution from ships, oil wells, and other sources can disturb them in ways we don't yet understand.

Exercise is good for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced in a world that is often busy and stressful. There are many reasons why you should exercise, and few reasons why you shouldn't. Exercise can help you feel stronger, improve your posture, and prevent injuries. It can also help you lose weight and improve your overall health.
Did you know that exercise can also help with depression, tiredness, and stress? It can even help with certain medical conditions. There are many types of exercise you can do, such as aerobics, jogging, or using free weights.
Remember to start slowly and carefully, especially if you're new to exercise. It's also a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise routine. Good posture is important, as it can affect how you look and feel. Imagine your head is connected to a balloon, and it's trying to lift you up. This can help you stand up straight and breathe more easily.
Stretching is also important. It helps improve your flexibility and makes it easier to move around. It can also help prevent injuries. You should stretch four or five times a week to stay flexible and fit. The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, a workout, and a cool-down.

AMANDA AND OWEN'S WILDLIFE ADVENTURES
Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman are two filmmakers who travel to Africa to make amazing wildlife films. They spend months in the jungle and plains, searching for the perfect shot. It's not easy - the rain has been heavy, and they have to be careful not to get stuck in the mud.
Amanda and Owen work together well. They have made many great films, like one about leopards. They are always looking for new and exciting animals to film. Right now, they are making a film about jackals.
Amanda and Owen are good friends and work well together. They both love animals and see the world in the same way. They set up their tents every night and make tea in the morning. They eat simple meals and can be away for up to eight weeks at a time.
It's not always easy, but it's worth it. They get to be close to the animals and become part of their lives. Once, they filmed a family of lions, and one lioness would come to say hello to their car every day.
Amanda and Owen have been working together for a long time. They make sure to plan their trips carefully and spend four months on location to get all the footage they need. Before they start filming, they write a script and get approval from their bosses.
Amanda and Owen want to make films that make people feel something. They want to show the beauty of the animals and the places they live. They believe that if they can make people feel something, it's better than just showing them facts.

Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. She's been preparing for the World Championships, which will take place next month. Before the tournament, she teaches at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to learn about her training venue. She said she's too focused on her movements and feet to notice the strange looks from people.
Kendra's life is all about getting ready for the Championships. She has a strict schedule to improve her fitness. This is her fourth World Championships, and it's going to be the biggest one yet with 27 countries participating.
We'll have home support, which is special, says Kendra. She wants to improve the reputation of netball in England. There will be more pressure than usual because we'll be playing in front of a home crowd. They will expect us to do well.
Our first game is against Barbados. We usually beat them, but they're a tough team. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra says the World Championships will be challenging. You have to play your best every day, and there's no rest between games.
Kendra has been playing netball at the top level for 15 years. The sport has become faster and more competitive. Players are more aggressive on court. But after the game, we're all friends again.
Netball is using new methods to test our fitness. Kendra thinks it's important to think and train like a world-class player. As captain, she wants to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example.
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided a while ago that this will be her last big competition. She might coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on the World Championships. When she leads her team out onto the court, she might have a tear in her eye. Her fans will be supporting her every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She studies the chemical processes that happen in the sea. Rachel is a teacher at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she's not teaching, she goes on underwater adventures in a special vehicle that looks like a small car. She dives down three kilometers to study underwater volcanoes.
The space inside the vehicle is very small, so Rachel has to stay close to the two pilots. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can take 16 hours - three hours to get to the bottom, 10 hours to collect samples, and three hours to go back up.
If something goes wrong, Rachel can press a panic button. The outside door opens, and a small escape vessel comes out. It's like a ball that goes up quickly to the surface. Rachel has made six dives and has been on a trip with a Russian team to study underwater volcanoes.
When she's not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She teaches and does research on underwater volcanoes, which she calls ""black smokers."" They're like chimneys that blow out black smoke. The water comes out of the rock and turns into black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees.
Rachel has been frightened only once, when she went on a dive with Americans and there was an explosion. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was a loud bang. Rachel thought she was going to die, but they were okay. The relief was incredible.
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Rachel feels a sense of wonder every time she looks out the window and sees the chimneys. She's the first person to see them, and it's an amazing feeling."

**First Impressions Matter**
When we meet someone for the first time, we often make a judgment about them in just a few minutes. We notice how they dress, how they talk, and how they move. Mary Pearce, a teacher, learned this the hard way. She had a small hole in her jacket during an interview, but she didn't change because she was already running late. Unfortunately, the interviewer thought she didn't care about her appearance, and that was a problem.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, agrees. He says that people who take care of their appearance are more likely to care about their job. Many people forget to dress professionally, like Janet Goodwood, who didn't get an interview for a promotion because of her clothes.
Our body language also matters. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 55% of our message comes from our facial expressions. If our words and facial expressions don't match, the listener will pay more attention to our body language.
It's also important not to seem too eager or desperate for a job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, got a job offer, but she reacted too excitedly and got a lower salary than she expected.
Finally, knowing about the company and preparing questions to ask during the interview can help. David Artesio, a manager, suggests looking at the company's annual report and mentioning areas that interest you. Business consultant Marian Woodall recommends speaking in short sentences and having a few questions ready.
I changed the text to make it more accessible for a B1 learner by:

**Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
A. Darius (runner)
I've always been into sports. I tried many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a tryout for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country's youth team and getting a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much attention in the media. I train at home during the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun - there are great athletics facilities and a good nightlife. But you have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. My goal is to get to the next Olympics.
B. Gabriel (surfer)
The surfing community is small, so you see the same people everywhere you compete. Professional surfers are serious and often the best waves are at dawn. You have to cut out late nights if you want to get good. I don't mind, but I do love sleeping in. But it's worth it because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships. After a big win, I like to celebrate with a big night out. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run.
C. Dieter (yacht racer)
When we're on a boat with five friends, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and like to celebrate a win with a big party. Sometimes reporters are more interested in where we go out and what we do there than in our sailing skills. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's great to come back and do normal things with my friends. You can't live and breathe sailing all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I'm not a celebrity. I get nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I always reply.
D. Tomas (tennis player)
It's great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd supporting me. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. I do get a thrill when fans recognize me when I'm out shopping or something. But it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players have to travel a lot, and that's why we split up. You have to make sacrifices in any sport. I'm focusing on my game now and will catch up on other things when I retire, because that comes soon in this sport."

Shopping with children can be difficult. They always want something new and exciting, like a special breakfast cereal or a Disney video. Sometimes, parents feel guilty if they say no, but if they say yes, they worry about buying unhealthy food. They also worry about not letting their children make their own choices.
Research shows that children ask for something new every two minutes when they are shopping with their parents. Companies spend a lot of money advertising to children, especially on TV. This can be confusing for children, who don't understand why their parents say no to some things.
Some parents feel stressed when they are shopping with their children because they have to make difficult decisions. They might say no to some things, but then feel guilty. They also worry about not letting their children make their own choices.
Experts say that supermarkets could make shopping easier for parents by moving sweets away from the checkout area or providing a play area for children. This would help reduce the stress and make shopping more enjoyable for everyone.

The hotel has the latest technology to make things easy for both the staff and the guests. The general manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests' names and preferences. He uses a computer system to keep track of this information. This system cost £250,000, but it will save the hotel money in the long run.
The hotel has many special features. For example, if a guest likes a certain type of music, the hotel can play it for them on their next visit. The hotel also has a special system to control the room temperature. Guests can adjust the temperature themselves, or they can ask the staff to do it for them.
The hotel has many rooms with modern technology. Each room has three phones, a fax machine, a photocopier, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has also thought about the future and has laid extra cables to be ready for new technology.
The hotel has many other facilities, such as a swimming pool, gym, conference rooms, bars, and restaurants. The food at the hotel is excellent, thanks to the chef, Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars. He has a new kitchen and can offer a wide range of dishes.

B. Linda Kelsey is a magazine editor. She says, ""I love my work, so it doesn't feel like a chore. I need a good night's sleep to feel energized. Exercise also gives me energy, but sometimes it's hard to find the motivation. When I do exercise, I feel great!""
C. Annie Nightingale is a disc jockey. She says, ""I get energy from being positive and enjoying life. I don't eat healthily, but I think that's okay. I love my job and the people I work with. When I'm having fun, I feel energized!""
D. Floella Benjamin is an author and TV presenter. She says, ""My energy comes from doing things I love and believing in what I do. Working with kids is great because they give me energy and make me feel happy. Smiling at people and seeing them smile back is a great way to get energy too!""
E. Deborah Moggach is an author and playwright. She says, ""I love creating something from nothing, like turning a wasteland into a garden. It gives me more energy than any exercise or sport. I also get energy from knowing that people want to read my writing.""
F. Katherine Monblot is a therapist. She says, ""You need to be interested and respect what you do in life. I like taking risks and trying new things, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do can drain your energy, so focus on what's important to you.""

Ice Skating
Ice skating has a long history. Archaeologists have found old skates made from animal bones. People used these skates until iron was introduced in Scandinavia about 2,000 years ago. In the past, only rich people could afford to skate. But in the 1920s, a young girl named Sonja Henie changed the way people skated. She made it more fun and exciting.
Now, ice skating combines art and sport. It's a great way to stay fit and have fun. To start, you need to learn how to balance and control your movements. Keep your knees bent and your body centered. Relaxing is also important. You should keep your heels together and your feet turned outwards.
To move on the ice, you need to make small movements with your feet. Start with short movements and gradually increase the distance as you get more comfortable. It's normal to fall, even for experienced skaters. To avoid getting hurt, try to relax and roll with the fall.
Once you're comfortable on the ice, you can try different styles, such as figure skating, free skating, or skating with a partner. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then moving on to free skating. Most ice rinks offer lessons and guidance to help you learn.
To improve your skating, you should practice regularly and do exercises to loosen up your muscles. This will help you move more smoothly and easily on the ice. Skating can also improve your balance, coordination, and overall health.

Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain. He is 228 cm tall. When he was 14, he wanted to join the navy. His teacher asked him what he wanted to be, and Chris replied, ""The flagpole on a ship!"" The teacher was right, as Chris was already very tall.
Every year, people in Europe are getting a little taller. This is because we are eating better and getting more nutrients. Our ancestors used to eat a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and animals. But 9,000 years ago, people started farming, and this changed everything. Now, most people eat the same three foods - wheat, rice, and maize - which are not very good for us.
This poor diet has made people unhealthy and short. In the past, people who ate these foods were not as strong and healthy as those who ate a variety of foods. But now, some countries are starting to eat more like our ancestors did, and this is making people taller again.
In the US, the average height is 179 cm, in Holland it is 180 cm, and in Japan it is 177 cm. This is good news, but it also means that we need to make our buildings and clothes bigger. Scientists think that the average height of people could reach 193 cm in the future.
However, some scientists also think that we might actually be getting smaller as a species. During the last ice age, our ancestors were taller and rounder because it was cold. Now that it's warmer, we are getting thinner and smaller. This means that our height might not keep growing forever.

What's it like to be in a TV studio audience? I found out. Many of us have wondered what it's like to watch TV shows being made. We might see people laughing and cheering on game shows, but we don't know much about them. Some people think studio audiences are made up of silly people who want to be on TV. But that's not true. People from all walks of life come to watch TV shows. They come from different jobs, ages, and places. TV tries to get different types of people to watch different types of shows.
Some people might think, ""Why would anyone want to go to a TV studio? You can watch the same show at home!"" But people have different reasons. Some want to be on TV, even if it's just for a second. Others are curious to see how TV shows are made. Many people just get a free ticket from a friend.
When you're in a studio audience, you sit with strangers and follow signs that tell you when to clap or laugh. It might seem like that's all there is to it, but it's not. Some people find it more exciting to watch live TV, while others like the feeling of being part of something special. I missed out on seeing the actors up close, but for many people, it's just a fun night out.

I don't like landscapes that are completely wild and untouched. I prefer places with human touches. When I travel, I like visiting old villages with temples, not empty deserts. When I was a child, I went to school in England and loved exploring the countryside. I would cycle to a village called Lastingham and enjoy the hills, valleys, and old villages. I even kept a diary to write about my adventures.
I still like visiting this place today. There's a small train that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, and I always sit in first class because it's not much more expensive. The scenery is not very exciting - we see sheep, a canal, and some fields. But there's one part of the journey that I look forward to - when the train goes through people's backyards. For a few minutes, we get to see people doing everyday things, like making tea or doing laundry. I like seeing how ordinary people live.
Matthew likes a place called the Hartland Peninsula. It's a remote and beautiful coast with few visitors. The beaches are hard to reach and have lots of rocks, so it's not crowded. People who visit like to enjoy the sea and reflect on its power. The coast is known for shipwrecks, and there are walks you can take to explore the area.
Annette likes the Trough of Bowland, a big open area with no many people. It's perfect for hiking and has a feeling of space. She discovered it by chance when she was a student and has been going back every year.
James bought a house called Glenthorne, which is his favorite place in Britain. He wanted peace and quiet and to reconnect with his English roots. He grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon, where he loved cycling around the moors and villages. He always wanted to visit Glenthorne, and now he can. It's a special, secluded, and romantic house where you can only hear the sound of the sea, wind, and birds."

We love animals and sometimes we have unexpected visitors at home. One day, my daughter found a pine snake and asked if we could keep it. I said yes, but only for one night. We set up a special tank for it. I was running late, so I quickly started cooking dinner when I heard my sons screaming for help. Domino, our cat, had caught a white mouse and was running around the room with it. I rushed in and tripped, but then I saw the snake had escaped from its tank. It was slithering all over the floor. I was scared, but I didn't want to hurt the snake. The cat, mouse, and kids were all running around, trying to get away from the snake. I finally caught the cat and saved the mouse. The snake was very slippery and hard to catch. After a while, I managed to pick it up and take it outside to the garden. I pointed it towards a tree, and it went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. My kids and I were relieved that it was gone. My youngest son said, ""That was a big snake!"""

""Write to me! In today's world of phones and computers, writing letters is becoming less popular. But I think there's something special about receiving a letter that you can't get from other forms of communication. When I was young, I used to write letters to my mother all the time. She always wanted me to write thank-you notes for gifts. It didn't matter if the letters were short or messy, as long as they were written. When I moved to London to study medicine, I would write to my mother every week. Sometimes my father would write too, and it was always exciting to receive his letters. The letters from home usually talked about everyday things, like what my parents and their friends were doing. We would also make phone calls, but I remember the letters more. I also received letters from my boyfriends when they were away. Writing letters actually helped our relationships. I found it easier to express myself in writing than in talking. I love getting letters with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to get a year's worth of news! It's also special when the letter comes from another country, like Sri Lanka or Australia. I have penfriends in these places and also in France. If I hadn't met my French friend in a restaurant, I wouldn't have been able to write to her. Now we write to each other regularly and have even visited each other's homes. I'm happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I want them to write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little notes, just like I used to write to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I think it's important to keep writing letters, so it doesn't become a lost art.""

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures on a mountain in the French Alps are being damaged. These pictures are over 4,000 years old and show cows, fields, and gods and goddesses. They were carved into the rock by people who used to pray and worship there. But now, as more and more tourists visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless visitors.
Tourists are walking on the drawings, wearing them away, and even taking pieces of the rock as souvenirs. Some people are using sharp objects to scratch their own drawings on the rocks. This is causing the pictures to disappear quickly.
Scientists are worried that if this continues, the pictures will not be left for future generations. They think the site should be closed to visitors, except for guided tours. However, others think this would cause too much trouble and would not be effective.
One expert suggests charging a fee to visit the site to raise money for guards and to protect the area. Another expert thinks the area should be roped off and guides should be provided. The government should provide the necessary funds to protect this important historic site.

Shopping with children can be very difficult for some mothers. They always want to buy everything they see, like the latest breakfast cereal or a Disney video. The mother in this story feels guilty when she says no to their demands because she thinks she's not giving them a good choice. She also gets angry and defensive when she has to say no. 
Research shows that children ask their parents to buy something every two minutes when they are shopping. This means that a lot of money is spent on advertising to children, especially on TV. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to some things, and the advertisements make them want to buy things even more. 
According to Susan Dibb, a food expert, parents are worried about what they feed their children and have their own ideas about what is healthy. However, these ideas are not always correct. It's good that parents talk to their children about food, but sometimes they feel like they are competing with the advertising industry. 
Some parents find it stressful to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother said she is patient when talking to her children about food, but she still feels unhappy about saying no to them. Another father, Mike, said that he and his wife are sometimes inconsistent in their answers to their children's requests. They say no to their son's requests for sweets because they are bad for him, but they buy chocolate and double cream for themselves. 
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from the checkout area or providing a play area for children. This might make parents want to shop more often without their children."

""Climbing has changed. No longer do climbers need to go to the mountains. Now, they can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. French climber Francois Lombard is hanging upside down from a climbing wall at the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham. The climbing wall is special because it's indoors and can be changed easily. 
In the past, climbers would go to cliffs to practice. But this wasn't always possible. In the winter, the weather was too cold, so they would walk or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. They started using brick edges and stone buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong and prevented boredom. 
Later, many sports centers built climbing walls specifically for this purpose. These walls had special edges for climbers to hold onto. One teacher, Don Robinson, built a climbing wall in his department at Leeds University. He had the idea to set natural rock into a block of concrete, which could be included in a wall. Many climbing walls were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s. However, they had some problems. The walls could only be built straight up and down, unlike cliffs, which have overhangs and angled rocks. 
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a material that could be molded into shapes like those found on cliffs. This material could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers got bored. French manufacturers also experimented with panels on steel frames. These frames could be built anywhere and allowed for interchangeable fixtures, giving climbers endless new holds to try."""

Do you want to be an actor? Many people think it's a risky career because there are more actors than there are jobs available. When you tell people you want to be an actor, some will say you're crazy. Others will give you different advice. But it's a personal choice, and you're the only one who can make it happen.
Becoming an actor is not easy. There's no special exam or guarantee of success. It's a mix of luck and talent. But there is a demand for new faces and new talent. And sometimes, acting can be exciting, glamorous, and rewarding.
So, what makes someone want to act? It's hard to explain, but for many actors, it's the moment when they connect with the audience. This is what drives them to keep acting. When asked how they've been successful, actors often shrug and say they don't know. They know some things about themselves and their technique, but they never take anything for granted. They know they're only as good as their next job, and their fame might not last.
Actors often don't talk about their chances of getting a part. They find ways to cope with the stress of auditioning and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, the possibility of rejection is there from the start. You're saying you're available, willing, and talented enough for the job. If you don't care, nobody else will."

Chris Greener is the tallest man in Britain. He is 228 cm tall. This is not unusual. Every year, people are getting taller. In fact, we are going back to how our ancestors were 40,000 years ago. They were taller and stronger because they ate a balanced diet.
For most of human history, people ate a variety of foods. Women gathered fruits and berries, and men hunted animals. This way of eating kept people healthy and strong. But about 9,000 years ago, people started farming. This changed everything. Now, most people eat the same three foods - wheat, rice, and maize. This diet is not good for our health and bodies.
In the past, people were not as tall as they are now. They were shorter and weaker. But in some countries, like the US, Europe, and Japan, people are eating better and getting taller again. This is good news, but it also means that we need to change the way we make clothes and furniture.
But there is a limit to how tall we can get. Scientists think that the maximum height is around 193 cm. However, as a species, we may actually be getting smaller. This is because our ancestors were taller and rounder during the last ice age. Since the climate warmed up, we have become thinner and smaller. And as the planet gets warmer, we may get even smaller.
The growth of humans could be affected by global warming. This means that we may not get as tall as we think we will.

Dave and Norm Lagasse are two brothers who have turned their childhood game into a successful business. They are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, playing the game of pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game to the USA from Quebec, Canada. The family loved playing the game on weekends and holidays. When they moved to New Mexico, they continued to play with the board their grandfather made from old wooden crates.
One day, Dave decided to make a new board because the old one was broken. A relative and a friend wanted one, and soon more people were asking for the game. The brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar and people were surprised by how much fun it was. They started asking about the game's origins, and Dave researched and found that it came from India, was adapted in Britain, and then brought to Canada by British people.
Pichenotte is a game of skill that can be played with two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces, or pucks, and tries to flick them onto a board with a wheel-like shape. The game is usually played for two minutes, and the player with the most points wins. The Lagasses started selling the boards at markets and craft fairs, and soon people were buying them. They even started holding championships and creating a trophy called the Lord Pichenotte Cup.
The brothers decided to start making the boards full-time and set up a workshop in their garage. They have made over 450 boards so far, which are made of birchwood and mahogany and are very durable. They sell the boards on their website for $595 each. While they don't have professional players or TV coverage yet, they hope that their business will grow and they will be able to buy a luxury car. For now, they are happy to play the game they love and make a living from it."

Welcome to the Model Village! This place used to be a piece of waste ground with brambles. But one man, Colin Sims, and his wife worked hard to turn it into this beautiful village. They moved a lot of soil and clay to create the landscape you see today. It was a big job that required a lot of hard work, but it was worth it.
To make the village look like a real place, they planted hundreds of trees and shrubs. They had to choose plants that could survive in a salty, windy area near the sea. Some plants came from local garden centers, while others came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims made all the models himself over nine years. He used different materials like stone, concrete, and plastic to make them last. He had to learn how to make them strong and durable, but he became an expert.
You'll notice that everything is on a small scale and looks very detailed. This took a lot of patience and special techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high-quality work.
You can see many different buildings, including a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. Please stay on the paths and don't touch the models. You can take photos from the paths, but not from close up. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.
We hope you enjoy your visit and would love to hear your comments. We're always planning new models and would like to know what you think. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please let us know!"

British newspapers often publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break their own rules. Celebrities usually don't pose for photographers, but sometimes they do. However, most people in the public eye suffer when their private moments are published on the front page. Few people complain to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with these issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do pictures of famous people help solve crimes? How did a famous actress's hotel room photo protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about paparazzi pictures before, but this time she didn't. The PCC should have looked into it.
The PCC should also investigate a recent story about a pop star's private life. The pop star didn't complain either. Shouldn't the PCC take the initiative? It seems like a good idea, but there are some problems. The PCC would have to decide when to investigate and how to do it. It would also have to deal with celebrities who might be upset if their stories weren't published. The PCC would have to monitor all British newspapers, which is a big task. Some people might not want an investigation because they're embarrassed. Others might be worried that a worse story would come out if they complained.
A British comedian was also a victim of the press. He and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon, and later, on a family holiday. He didn't complain because he was afraid the newspaper would run the pictures again with a new story about his anger. People are afraid to challenge the tabloids because they think they'll be targeted again. It's hard to find a solution to this problem."

When you have been in your first job for a while, you might think about moving to a new job. This is a big decision, and you should think carefully about what you want to do. You might want to stay in the same field, take on more responsibility, or try something new.
When choosing a new job, think about your long-term goals. Do you want to specialize in a particular area or move to a different field? You should choose a job that will help you grow and develop as a professional.
It's also a good idea to think about your future. You might want to travel or take a break before moving to a new job. This can be a good way to gain new experiences and skills.
Juliette Davidson, for example, worked for three solicitors after leaving college. She liked her first job, but it didn't offer much opportunity for advancement. So, she took a year off to travel and then found a new job as a Personal Assistant to a Chief Executive. In two and a half years, she has become more confident and her job has changed. She now does more important tasks, like managing correspondence and budgets, and works on special projects.
When choosing a new job, remember to think about your long-term goals and what you want to achieve. Choose a job that will help you grow and develop as a professional, and don't be afraid to take a break or try something new."

I visited a kite-flying festival in Malaysia with a friend named Adnan. He gave me a kite as a gift because the string had broken. I was surprised and asked him why. He said it's a tradition in Malaysia - if the string breaks, the finder gets to keep the kite. He showed me his many kites, all the same size and made of special paper and bamboo.
We sat under some trees and looked out at the festival. There were 10 platforms where people held up their kites, and many people waiting to let their kites fly. When the whistle blew, the kites went up in the air like rockets. There were over 500 people competing, and they had to make four different kites each. Adnan told me that making kites is not easy, but flying them is not so hard.
Adnan invited me to visit him at his home, and I accepted. He showed me around and we had tea and snacks. He said I could come back the next day to help him make a new kite, but I didn't have time. Instead, I drove to a nearby town and then got lost in the forest. I met a man named Baba who had a tent and some huts, and I decided to stay there. The night was dark and noisy, but I was too tired to worry about the insects. The next morning, I woke up to a beautiful view of the mountains. It rained later, and I got wet, but I was relieved to find my car was still there at the bottom of the track.
When I got back to the city, everyone was friendly and curious. They asked me where I was from and how old I was, but it was all friendly. I remember my trip to Kelantan more for the kind people than the kites."
