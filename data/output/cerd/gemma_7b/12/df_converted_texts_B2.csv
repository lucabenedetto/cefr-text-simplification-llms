Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their careers. To be successful in today's world, you need to be more than just skilled. You also need to be able to communicate effectively, be open-minded, and be able to build relationships.

There are a number of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you love and that allows you to use your skills and talents. Another is to be able to work in a supportive and collaborative environment. Finally, it is important to be able to find a sense of purpose in your work.

However, there are also a number of challenges that can make work less fulfilling. One is stress and burnout. Another is the feeling of being stuck in a rut. Finally, it is the feeling of not being appreciated or respected.

If you are feeling unfulfilled in your work, there are a number of things you can do. You can talk to your boss about your concerns, or you can look for a new job. You can also try to find ways to make your work more enjoyable, such as by taking on new challenges or by working with a team of people you enjoy.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.

The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate. Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium.

However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments.

The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like no matter how much stuff you have, you don't feel secure. Having a home that meets your needs is reasonable, but there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities. It's designed to make us feel like we need things to be happy. We are constantly being exposed to advertising messages - on TV, the radio, newspapers, magazines, and the internet. They all encourage us to buy, buy, buy.

Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years. But because they require physical agility, cave research has been less in the hands of academics than other scientific fields. However, there is a lot of overlap between professional and amateur cave research.

Meteorology is the study of weather. It started with simple observations made by people who used their senses. Today, meteorology is a highly technical science. Satellites and electronic instruments relay weather information quickly. Computers can solve complex mathematical problems at a speed that humans can't even imagine. But human experience is still the most important part of meteorology. It's the one that translates data into weather forecasts.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first in opera. The music is the foundation of the performance, and it is what makes the event truly captivating.

In contrast to music audiences, theatre audiences have different expectations. They mainly understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly impressed by long and difficult speeches. However, they are often awestruck by the skill of the performers.

There are some similarities between music and theatre audiences. They both appreciate the artistry and passion of the performers. They also understand the importance of creating a shared experience.

In order to improve the relationship between music and theatre, I believe that there is a need to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. This could be achieved through innovative approaches, such as staging operas in unconventional locations or using new technologies to create a more immersive experience for audiences.

I want both music and theatre to thrive, and for more and more people to experience the joy of being an audience.<eos>"

Sand is a nuisance when it's in its natural state. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you like 'stucco'. It's hard to get rid of sand, even with a fireman's hose. But, when you step onto a beach towel or climb into a car, the sand falls off. It can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.

A lock and key have been used for a long time to keep people out of places. They provide a sense of security and privacy. But people don't like computerised locking systems.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.

The film studios The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a complex place. It possessed a few permanent landmarks such as the Script Department, but it also appeared to be made up of numerous small rooms, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations. To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing.

So I've only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film.""<eos>"

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.

My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.

My mother was a solitary person. She was as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She had a strong personality and was known for her strict rules and her obsession with cleanliness. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked.

I remember my mother taking me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. Here, hand-in-hand, we would parade through roomfuls of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification.<eos>"

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was thick. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses down the street that I remembered. They had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. Wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses that had once been homes had become stores, and the stores that had once been homes had become houses again. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?

I swam in the pool. The warm rain tumbled from the gutter. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm intensified, drowning birdsong, and a haze rose off the water as though the pool itself were rising to meet the lowering sky. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social significance. It can help to develop the attachment between mother and child. Tears can also be used to express sympathy for those suffering terrible injustice. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We know that human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases, which are closely related to global temperature. We also know that the average annual global surface temperature has increased by between 1C and 3.5C since 1950.

The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. For example, the average sea level is rising, and extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, are becoming more frequent. These changes are having a negative impact on many ecosystems and human societies.

The most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the rise in sea levels. This is caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe.<eos>"

Aesthetics is a field that studies the nature of beauty and art. However, the existence of artworks often hinders the understanding of aesthetic theory. This is because artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they exist. This separation of artworks from human experience creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.

The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events. When what we know as art is relegated to the museum and gallery, the unconquerable impulse towards experiences enjoyable in themselves finds such outlet as the daily environment provides.<eos>"

The early 1990s were a tough time for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.

There are a number of factors that have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult.

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in national events and individual activities. It provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal. Playing an instrument can have many benefits, including improving cognitive skills, social relationships, and concentration. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can help develop transferable skills such as punctuality and organization.

The craft of acting is often met with disdain and contempt. Many actors fall into the trap of talking about their craft in interviews, instead of giving the dancer Pavlova's reply: 'If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it.'

Blogging: Confessing to the world

Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing everything on the internet.

There are a lot of benefits to blogging, such as wealth and fame. But there are also risks, such as being fired from your job or having your privacy violated.

It is a collection of individual artworks that relate to each other purely through the fact that they proclaim to be art. The works do not impede each other and actually give something to each other.

The painting is of a fishmonger's slab with a crab, and a pair of scales containing two or three soles. The painting has a symbolic edge. There is an undercurrent of menace and barely suppressed violence that gives the picture a symbolic edge.<eos>"

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. The photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

Throughout history, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image. Photography has been seen as a way to provide a truthful visual record. It has also been held to be an achievement of sophisticated culture and produced the type of image that artists had struggled throughout the centuries to acquire.

However, photography is not without its challenges. One challenge is that it can be difficult to penetrate through cultural differences in understanding. Another challenge is that photography can be biased. It is important to be aware of these challenges so that we can use photography responsibly.<eos>"

Poetry writing is like walking through a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and careful, or you'll blow up. If you want to write poetry, you should read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination and spirit run wild. You can also write to a schedule or wait for inspiration to strike. The most important thing is to find your own rhythm and let your creativity flow.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters, long narratives, or unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story. Dialogue is more effective than long explanations. Keep your writing concise and focused on the main point.

Screenplay writing is like playing chess. You need to be able to see the big picture and understand long-term strategy. The more you practice, the more you'll learn about the complexities of writing.

Writing is a human instinct, but written language is not. It's a complex system that has been invented only a few times in history. Children are naturally wired for sound, but they need to learn how to write in order to express themselves. We need to understand how the minds of children work and how to help them learn to write.<eos>"

I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals. I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving. I have taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are a popular way to enjoy poetry. There are two main types of poetry recitals: those that are intended to be printed and read on the page, and those that are intended to be performed live. The poets who write for the page tend to be more serious and dedicated to their craft, while the poets who perform live tend to be more popular and accessible. There are a number of benefits to attending poetry recitals, such as the ability to learn about the art of poetry and to appreciate the beauty of poetry.

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture

The growing trend of historians to rely on oral evidence has its challenges. It is difficult to determine whether someone's testimony accurately reflects the past. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.

Students who come to study a social science for the first time must familiarize themselves with the substance and methodology of the subject. Each discipline of the social sciences focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses particular methods of study.

Classical architecture was much more than the mere construction of buildings. It was an art form that emphasized aesthetics over function. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, in essence, the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.<eos>"

The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.

Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to grant this. On the road Lily had actually overtaken a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve and such timing that Mui had pressed her lips closely together against her own protest.

The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances. Taken aback, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the two sisters to look at the grey barbarian sea. He perched Son on the top railing and put his arms around his stomach.

Chen resolved to bring Son up his way. He would have an education in figures (Chen's own weak point) and grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience in all aspects of the trade on the way. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career.<eos>"

The Internet has opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits is that it has made book reviews accessible to everyone. Anyone can visit Amazon.com and read or write reviews. This has led to a lot of mischief, but it has also made it easier for authors to connect with their readers.

The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com are serious and provide a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods is worth buying. However, there is also a lot of silliness. For example, one writer wrote a review that compared the book to the architecture of the Internet. Another writer wrote a review that praised the book for providing a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts.

Overall, the democratisation of literary criticism has been a positive development. It has made book reviews more accessible to everyone and has also made it easier for authors to connect with their readers.<eos>"

Art in modern times, has become more prominent over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we tend to get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. This is often due to our expectations for art to be puzzling and new. We require artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive, so vigorous that conventions cannot contain them.

Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds. An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book and writes it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting.

The exhibition ""Underground Encounters"" showcases paintings and drawings of the London Underground. It is a popular exhibition because it conforms to the unspoken rule of commercial success as a painter. If you are interested in art, you should definitely check out ""Underground Encounters.""<eos>"

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The overcrowded tube journey had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead and the smell of dinner from the kitchen. He remembered his grandmother's insistence that the returning breadwinner should be given peace and relief from petty domestic anxieties. The job was important to Lois and important to them both.

I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.

My upstairs neighbour, Jaz, is leaning out of the window. She is a writer and I sometimes call upon her to dissemble about her unpublished manuscripts.

I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing presents and mall-order goodies to other houses.

I have a life. I go out sometimes and fly home again, sitting on the tube with my nose in a book. When I go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment's reassurance.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower, more purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.<eos>"

England's breakfast revolution. A good breakfast is important according to health experts. In historical terms, breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England. There are some references to travellers having a meal at dawn and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast. As individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours, often starting work extremely early, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. Birds have been flitting through the undergrowth of British culture ever since it began. In medieval times, a complicated system of observing the directions in which wrens flew determined the sort of luck the observer would experience. In modern times, the image of the wren remains in pictures and ceramics in many British households.

Our relationship with other creatures is more than cultural and goes way back to the evolution of human nature. Flight, song, freedom - our fascination, envy and emulation of the avian world is surely a measure of our own identity against that of the wildness of nature.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content. The development of cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. It has also led to the invention of new tools and techniques for mapping.

For example, warm and wet climates can support the growth of tropical jungles, which are home to a wide variety of species. Cold and windy climates can only support a few living things.

The weather patterns that make up the climate are caused by the movement of air. Air rises and mixes with other air masses, and this motion creates turbulence. The sun is a major source of turbulence. Coffee is a popular drink that people often enjoy. It is made with coffee beans, water, and milk. To make a good cup of coffee, you need to use the right equipment and follow the correct steps.

Art and the Visual Arts

Television often fails to showcase the pleasure and complexity of looking at paintings and sculptures. There are few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of art. One example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part survey of American art, American Visions. The series focuses on the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

Metals Market

The metals market is regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-trade global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing.

Abaco Islands

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. Each island has its own personality and something to offer. To get anywhere in the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. There are plenty of ferries, water-taxis and boats to rent. Sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that gems can be found. At night it's the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay that sparkle.<eos>"

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate named the aye-aye. The aye-aye is similar to a woodpecker in many ways. It also bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface in its search for insect larvae. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations.

We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting.

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the aircraft became weightless and floated aimlessly for 20 seconds. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were fed every four hours and eventually they were weaned on to creamed rice. After a few months, they were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hardboiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening.

The cubs were playful and would chase each other's tails. I also saw odder badgers in our field. We built a sett for the badgers and they moved into it. Now, I see the cubs only occasionally, but they still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.

Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer and geophysicist who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass, which are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.

Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various places, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and England. From these travels, he published a chart that proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific merit. It will involve making precise measurements of the terrestrial magnetic field and refining the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.

Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England and has a strong understanding of navigation and geomagnetism. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews.<eos>"

Peacocks that live at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. Wallace, on the other hand, believed that the peacocks' trains were used for sexual selection. The debate between Darwin and Wallace continues to this day.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are trying to settle the matter once and for all. They are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to see if the hens really do choose the males with the showiest trains. They have found that the hens do like the showiest males, but they are not sure if the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways.

There is a final twist to this story. Fisher's Runaway theory suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the rest, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This process will continue to repeat itself, and eventually, the males with the longest tails will get most mates and leave most offspring.<eos>"

The best boat design should combine old and new. Tom Cunliffe says that this is the case. He designed his own craft, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has benefited from all the magic of old-fashioned boat design, but it would have been a much harder job without the advances of modern know-how. However, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life. This is often the very reality that sailors hoped to rediscover by going to sea in the first place.

My own boat is a humble craft that lies quietly on a tidal creek off the south coast. It was designed last year, but seeing her, you might imagine her to be 100 years old. Despite being an indispensable tool in current design methods and boat-building practice, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life.

When I bought my boat, Hirta, I realised that she had every comfort, but no luxury. She taught me how wise he was. Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and absolutely no electronics. Back on land, however, it is a sad fact that the very antiquity of classic boats means that they need a lot of looking after.

The Westerman has never disappointed me. Although she is a beautiful boat, she is also very strong and durable. She is made of timber treated with a penetrating glue, which makes her totally impervious to water. Thus she has all the benefits of a glass fibre boat yet looks like, feels like and sails like the real thing.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans have not developed any significant differences from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities exist between humans and animals. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.

There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity. However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Someone who behaves abnormally or refuses to conform to the accepted norms of society is called eccentric. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity. The desire to be accepted and loved is stronger than the desire to stand out in the crowd. People who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems. The most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness.

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in the world of chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. The game is becoming longer and there is more pressure on the players. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'.

Volunteer tourism is a topic that is discussed by four academic writers. They argue that while volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, the actual contribution to development is often not as great as it seems. However, volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, widespread and democratic participation in global affairs, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities.<eos>"

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. One common way to wake up is the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available models.

The 'dual alarm function' does not allow you to be woken up by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends.

We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses and telephone.'

The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.

The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'.<eos>"

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked. The effectiveness of this defence mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

To excel in any sport is challenging, even for men. Women have to be even tougher. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. Despite the odds, women are breaking records and achieving their goals.

Here, we talk to just a few brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, a skier, says, ""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. You just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice.""

B. Caroline, a cyclist, says, ""I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I'm because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money.""

C. Annabel, a rower, says, ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level.""

D. Ffyona, a long-distance walker, says, ""I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record!""

E. Lisa, a saloon car racer, says, ""Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!""

F. Alison, a triathlete, says, ""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes!""<eos>"

The day I met Picasso, I was an 18-year-old student travelling around Europe and Morocco. I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront and spent much of my time drawing. One day, I met Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was seated with his wife and three companions. I was surprised to see him and managed to get his signature. Picasso was known to be a reclusive artist, so I was doubly astonished to find him in such a public place. I drew a portrait of Picasso and he gave me a generous nod. He also signed my drawing. I was delighted to meet Picasso and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have been able to draw his portrait.<eos>"

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They may place their fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale, to enhance this. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store.

Supermarkets also use lighting to attract shoppers. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.

Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'.

As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you - irresistible if you've had nothing to eat before setting out on your shopping trip.<eos>"

Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are two climbers and sailors who have achieved great success. Bonnington is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. Knox-Johnston began his sea career in the Merchant Navy and was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handedly. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

One day, the author was working on a book about adventure and called Knox-Johnston to ask for an interview. They went sailing and climbing together, and the author learned a lot from Knox-Johnston's skills. The author found that sailing was trying and boring, but he also found that it was a great way to build friendships.

The author also found that climbing with Knox-Johnston was challenging. He had to watch for Robin's safety and make sure that he was not putting himself at risk. The author felt that he was useless at times and that he was not trusted by Knox-Johnston. However, the author and Knox-Johnston were able to build a strong friendship through their shared experiences.<eos>"

Apples have been with humans since the dawn of recorded time. They have been eaten in many different ways throughout history. In prehistoric times, people spat out apple pips or left apple remains to carbonise. Ancient humans also stored apples for the winter. Over time, different varieties of apples were developed. Some of the most famous apples include the Old English Pearmain, the Costard, the Pippins, the Delicious, and the Granny Smith. Apples are now grown all over the world. Most apples are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all.<eos>"

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-meter runners, visited the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp. The camp is located in Nanyuk, Kenya's Central Highlands. It is a beautiful, lonely, and isolated spot. The training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and train three times a day. The daily regime includes a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Running apart, life is simple and uncomplicated. The athletes eat a simple diet and bathe in streams. By the time the runner leaves the camp, he is even more appreciative of Kenyan success.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. As brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are.

If you visit a supermarket, you will probably buy a few advertised brands, but not many. You will probably buy a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands.

The truth is nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. The advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments.

If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly. So, any advertising campaign, for any product, which could win over 2 per cent of the population would be outstandingly successful.<eos>"

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. There is a monastic stillness in the house. The Vales designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. They also designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and inexpensive to run.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought they were real. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for centuries. They have been responsible for providing weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used as they once were, but there has been a recent revival in interest in the craft.

The blacksmiths craft is unique because the metal is incredibly soft when it is hot, but becomes rigid and immovable when it cools down. This makes it a challenging medium to work with, but also a rewarding one.

There are many different types of blacksmithing, including decorative blacksmithing, which is the focus of this text. Decorative blacksmithing involves creating items for aesthetic purposes, such as gates, railings, and sculptures.

The blacksmiths craft is a valuable one and it is important to preserve it for future generations. There are a number of events happening over the next few weeks that aim to promote the blacksmiths craft. These events will provide an opportunity for people to learn more about blacksmithing and to see some beautiful examples of the craft.<eos>"

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was furious. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I suppose my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours later was slightly irritating. The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not particularly want to. For one thing, I resented the pressure from the anti-smoking mob - and I still do. For another, I had low blood pressure and a long-living and healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and threw off colds more easily, it seemed to me, than friends with consciously healthier lifestyles. On that day, I had simply gone to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to give up. I could not have been more reasonable. After all, I positively enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me rather knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wished and most of the afternoon was conducted in a room so smoke-filled that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others. I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense. The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world? In many senses, it was easy. The physical craving, the pangs of desire for nicotine, faded after a minute or two. The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order. Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing - and it still is.<eos>"

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1964 for her work on penicillin and vitamin B12. She was also a mother of three and wife to a historian. Hodgkin's life reflects some of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century, including the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.

There are a few challenges associated with writing a biography of a scientist. One challenge is that scientists often avoid personal appearances and interviews. Another challenge is that scientific ideas can be difficult to understand for many people. However, Hodgkin's biography is a good example of how to write a compelling scientific biography that is accessible to a wide audience.<eos>"

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense' that allows her to locate water. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business.

Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. After the map has indicated likely areas, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the straight part of the stick rises up.

Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?<eos>"

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere.

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again.

C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep in late. After that it was time for a maths class and a nature project. The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming, anyway!

D. Hilary's story I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day.<eos>"

His records are opening up new repertory, including concertos by long-neglected composers. When you meet him, he seems even younger than his years and has a bright and open personality. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in London. He owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father gave him a genuine grown-up trumpet, and his mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson. Bo was an up-and-coming musician and spotted natural talent in Hardenberger. From the very start, Hardenberger has had the gift of finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. He has a particular gift of communicating and can move people through his music.<eos>"

A good leader inspires, motivates, and shows the way forward. Leadership is not about height or intelligence. It's about making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are. To be a good leader, you should be able to speak out articulately and with conviction. You also need to be able to motivate others and inspire them to believe in themselves.

Becoming a leader is recognizing your latent talents and developing them. It's like being born with the potential to lead, but needing the right circumstances to flourish. You can benefit from improving your leadership skills, regardless of your position or level of seniority.

There are some definite lessons to be learned about leadership. First, find out where your passions and convictions lie and act on them. Second, start thinking of yourself as a leader and recognize your ability to lead. Third, experiment with your style and find what works best for you. Fourth, set goals and work hard to achieve them.

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

To photograph people effectively, you should follow these tips:

1. Group people in a way that is visually appealing.
2. Help your subject relax and pose naturally.
3. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
4. Use eye contact or gestures to engage the viewer.
5. Consider the overall composition of the picture, including the subject and the background.
6. Take candid pictures of events as they happen.

By following these tips, you can take better pictures of people and capture their personality and expression.<eos>"

Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. It comprises basic elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.

In the new workplace, emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world. It is a crucial set of skills that can help people work together smoothly towards their common goal.

More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a valuable component of management philosophy. If a person has a deficiency in emotional intelligence, it can hinder the use of whatever technical expertise or intellect they may have.

Emotional intelligence can be learned and added to one's tool kit for survival. It is especially relevant at a time when it seems a contradiction to put the words 'job' and 'stability' together.<eos>"

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received the most attention.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy flow through the body. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating chronic pain, back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine. It is also used during surgery.

Traditional acupuncturists believe that acupuncture is most effective when used in conjunction with traditional Chinese medicine. They also believe that it can bring about deep changes that lead to a longer cure.<eos>"

P. D. James, a best-selling crime writer, is known for her intricate and brilliant imagination. She exudes an air of quiet authority, but it is soon apparent that she is actually shy. She has written 12 major detective novels that are read avidly by millions worldwide. She is a great fan of the works of close friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys reading detective stories.

Success came to P.D. James late in life. Born in Oxford, she grew up mainly in Cambridge. She worked full-time in administration for the National Health Service and made good use of her organizational skills. She became 'quite accustomed' to seeing corpses while working in forensic science. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. It was the shape and construction involved in the writing of a crime novel that appealed.

She says, 'Writing detective stories is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life - even if that life is unlovable. Nobody really likes violence.'<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.

Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as deviousness, intelligence, and confidence. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other serious problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them.<eos>"

The office environment has a significant impact on employee health and happiness. A new survey found that fresh air and the right chairs are key to creating a positive working atmosphere. The study visited four contrasting offices to assess their health and happiness levels. The expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist.

Office A is a small, dynamic team office with a simple and straightforward layout. The lack of central heating and mechanical ventilation is compensated for by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators. The office is cozy and comfortable, but the furniture is not ergonomic.

Office B is a comfortable and well-maintained office with good air quality and general maintenance standards. However, the space is impersonal and unstimulating. Office C is a glass case office with a mix of smokers and non-smokers. Despite the air conditioning control issues, the office is relatively comfortable. Office D is a dusty and cluttered office with inadequate desk space and poor air conditioning control.

The survey findings suggest that the office environment can have a significant impact on employee health and happiness. By creating a comfortable and stimulating work environment, companies can improve employee productivity and well-being.<eos>"

Chewing gum culture is fashionable, classless, and popular in the United States. Americans chew 12 million sticks of gum a day. Gum is a food that contains fewer than ten calories per stick. Today's gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree. American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees. Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree. Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.<eos>"

The receptionist was reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest, but she was oblivious to the identity of the real guest. Sue was not impressed by the hotel's poor service and condition. She found out that the hotel was rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide. However, there were some problems with the hotel. The access from the car park was via an unmanned door, and the corridor was long and deserted.

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Living in the valley, we had been there for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But the snow and wind were not the biggest threat to us. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder and the dam was filling up quickly. One day, the dam overflowed and the river surged like Niagara Falls. The river seemed wild beneath the bridge and was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy the huge clouds that hang over the valley and be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.<eos>"

Film critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was his first proper job. Before that, he had done bits of reviewing novels and films. That was how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom hired him, but he was not primarily a journalist. He would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff. At first, Tom's idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which they would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me.

The hobby of collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. Many people enjoy collecting objects for various reasons. Some people collect objects because they have complete control over their collection. Others collect objects because they simply enjoy doing it. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a 'room of wonders'. Another aristocrat, Catherine the Great of Russia, collected more than 4,000 paintings. If you are interested in collecting, you do not have to be rich and powerful. You can start a collection with items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. It is the way that collections change hands that has always interested me. As small objects become a popular collector's item, so they begin to rise in price.<eos>"

You're not happy with your job, but you don't know how to change. If you're in this situation, you should consider talking to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then give you a summary of the findings from a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on this information, they will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and other similar tasks. After the test, you will have a long chat with an adviser and they will produce a report giving their observations and recommendations.

Rethinking your career needn't involve a massive change of direction. Last March, after working as a marketing manager with a large insurance company for five years, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job.

I thought a careers adviser might suggest something I had never thought of. Although I was given a host of new ideas, I rejected them as they either required a substantial drop in salary or considerable retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't know.'<eos>"

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries around the world. It is made from cacao beans, which are also called cocoa beans. The cacao tree is a tropical plant that grows in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate.

In Aztec times, cocoa beans were used as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week. Manufacturers are looking for new ways to attract customers. The latest marketing trick is the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert.<eos>"

The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.

Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000 into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.

The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens.<eos>"

I was tired, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was glad to be home. I bought one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket. We were just there to get by and have a good time doing so. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

Sometimes, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The baggage system can fail for a number of reasons, including extra security checks, air traffic problems, human error, and accidents. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.

The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It feeds on fish. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He has a deep feeling for this little bird. There is some scientific truth in the story about kingfishers. They have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue. The kingfisher is a popular bird to photograph. It is easy to watch from a hideout. Charlie James' first hideout was an old blanket which he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favourite spot. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream. He missed lessons and became an 'academic failure'. But his interest in kingfishers was getting noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.<eos>"

Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is captain of England's netball team. She had a typical day for the weeks leading up to the World Championships: teaching at a local school and training in the local supermarket car park.

The World Championships will be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part. The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the Championships will be tough.

Kendra has been playing at top level for fifteen years. The sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive.

Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra.<eos>"

A child who shows outstanding musical ability may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. Specialist music schools in Britain provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen to develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend a significant amount of time on musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which concentrates on the essential subjects.

What are the disadvantages of attending a specialist music school?

- The cost is high.
- Not all parents want to send their children to boarding school.
- Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years.
- The pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure.
- The academic programme is restricted.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

On the rails, five celebrities share their favorite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.

Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favorite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.

Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. The journey itself was lovely and the dress she wore on the train was a gift from her husband.

Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. The train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes he had ever seen.

Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favorite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life.<eos>"

Trying to get published? If you are thinking about writing and wondering where to send your story, Margaret Stubbs has some advice for you. To get published, you need to research your markets, find out about publishers, and practice your writing skills. You also need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. To do this, you can read everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time. As a writer, you need to be patient and persistent. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. But don't give up. Keep writing and keep practicing. With hard work and dedication, you can achieve your dream of becoming a successful writer.<eos>"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting for the train in the Baltimore railway station. There were a lot more people waiting than I had expected. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples with matching luggage and swarms of college kids littering the floor. A man was walking around speaking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. I understood why he didn't. He seemed unreliable. He marched on down the row to one of the matched-luggage couples. I was looking at him and thinking about what he was saying. He was talking about his daughter and her passport. He said he put his daughter on a train and came home to find his wife in a state. I felt sorry for him. But I didn't say anything. I waited to see where he was heading. He was holding a packet. It looked like it was stapled shut. I said silently, ""Watch yourself, lady.""<eos>"

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was to know someone who knew someone who was leaving a place. If you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

The flat was upstairs and there was a cheerful-looking girl coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.'

Jo went on climbing and met a punk named Pauline. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.

Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.

Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.<eos>"

Getting fit is essential for mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It improves the condition of the heart and lungs and blood circulation. It also helps to ease depression and tiredness, and regulate sleep patterns. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. The best exercise, therefore, involves a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout and definitely a cool down period.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe our appearance, including our clothing, eye contact, body language, and the speed and volume of our speech.

Mary Pearce was a student who worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job because the Head Teacher thought she didn't fit the image of an office manager.

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages, the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message.

Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. It is important to be well-informed about the company, have a few questions ready, and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences.<eos>"

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. When I left home to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a week. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. Letter writing seemed to improve relationships. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. I also have penfriends in Australia and France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being damaged. The 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged rapidly. The mountain is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. The pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some experts believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site but charge a fee.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. If the government does not provide funding, the drawings will be lost for future generations.<eos>"

Usually, parents can't afford to buy all of their children's demands, and they feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Sometimes, parents feel frustrated and defensive when they say no to their children's requests. They also admit that they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict, such as removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas.

**Questions:**

1. What are some of the common demands that children make when shopping at the supermarket?
2. Why do parents feel guilty about buying and feeding their children rubbish?
3. What are some of the challenges that parents face when shopping with children?
4. What could supermarkets do to ease parent-child conflict?<eos>"

Going up the wall was once a challenging climb that could only be done in the mountains. Now, a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath as high above them on the climbing wall, hangs the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. As the sport developed, it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for the task, using bricks with special edges to cling on to.

If you want to become an actor, it's a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs. Once you decide to become an actor, people may tell you that you're crazy. But it's a personal choice and only you can take responsibility for yourself. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You need luck and talent. There is a demand for new faces and new talent. Acting is all about making contact with the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted. Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. You need to be prepared for rejection. If you don't care enough, no-one will care for you.<eos>"

Chris Greener was tall when he was young, and he is the tallest man in Britain today. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. More and more people are being born who are very tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. But when agriculture was invented, our diet changed. We started to eat mostly carbohydrates, such as wheat, rice, and maize. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are playing a game called pichenotte. It's a game that their grandfather brought to the USA from Canada. The game is popular in their hometown of Santa Fe, New Mexico. It's a game of skill and it's fun to play.

The game is played on a wooden board with 12 pieces called pucks. You flick the puck across the board using your hand. If you flick the puck into the hole, you get 20 points. If you flick the puck into one of the rings, you get points too. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses have made a lot of money from selling pichenotte boards. They've sold more than 450 boards and they're making a lot of money. They're happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune.<eos>"

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. These pictures often damage individuals in the public eye when they see their most private moments captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. However, there are also some problems with this idea. If the PCC decided to take on this role of 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless?<eos>"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. It should show evidence of serious career planning and extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.

Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system and are not likely to go off again. If the travel bug is biting, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then.<eos>"

Confident people may appear to be born with it, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned. Nina Hathway asked five people how they did it.

A Jenny, a young woman, was shy and thought she would always stay that way. But she surprised herself by doing well at school and was encouraged to do a university course.

B Michaela, a businesswoman, became too aggressive and impatient when she took over her family business. She learned that to be confident, you have to believe in yourself and be patient.

C Lisa, an actress, has a calmer appearance, but she's actually terrified when she's in important situations. She's learned that the best way to gain confidence is to look confident, even if you don't feel it.

D Barbara, a restaurant owner, has a natural confidence that comes from enjoying her work. She believes that if you just get on with it and learn from your mistakes, you'll be more confident the next time round.

E Kim, a politician, was nervous about speaking in public. But she found that by jotting down a few things and telling herself repeatedly that nothing is impossible, she was able to overcome her fear and become more confident.<eos>"

For one group of children, aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are a time for learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. In time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

Ever since she was a child, she has loved drawing clothes and designing patterns. She never told her parents that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a loan and begin her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her.

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the north to the south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The climate can be bitterly cold because of its northerly location. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred meters up - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. The track soon climbed and their legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, Keith had to rest more frequently. After seven hours of climbing, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. Keith was glad they had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when he was safe in the tent that he could say he really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not great, but we had everything we needed. On Saturday morning, I met the other ten members of our group. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have excellent eyesight and can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who often require handling sharks.

Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. I was nervous at my first ballet class because I didn't know anyone. Everyone was friendly and I managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me and my Russian has improved enormously. The classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. I feel confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops. At the moment, we are preparing for a new production and there's also a competition for young dancers which I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.<eos>"

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous.

As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed. The hotel melts in the spring. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC. Guests need to wear warm winter clothes and socks. If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.<eos>"

A new furniture shop, Homestyle, opened last Thursday. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for PS45 and a bed for PS30. The shop's normal hours are 9 am to 9 pm every day. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening due to a large crowd.

The shop was soon full and the managers decided to close the doors. People outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. There was also a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop.

One customer, Jenny Smith, managed to get into the shop. She said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.'<eos>"

Tanya Streeter is a world-record-holding free-diver. Free-diving is a sport where people reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath. She had been deeper a year before, but this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man.

Tanya's training regimen is intense. She spends two thirds of her time doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart, but she doesn't run because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness.

When Tanya is not training, she makes frequent public appearances, mainly to advertise sports products. She has also supported environmental organisations. As for the future, Tanya says she plans to keep breaking her own world records.<eos>"

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, one or two directors had some original new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed, mainly because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main idea of the text?
2. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of making cartoon films for adults and children?
3. What was the main reason for the failure of The Black Cauldron?
4. What did directors learn from the failure of The Black Cauldron?

No Title When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, I had a simple goal: to earn enough to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a global company that is growing rapidly. Since we began, I have learned a lot. Much of what I have learned can be found in this book. I believe that we, as a company, have something valuable to share about how to run a successful business without giving up what we believe in. It's not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The message is that to succeed in business, you have to be different. Business can be fun, a business can be run with love and it can do good. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. Now this book sends these ideas of mine out into the world, makes them public. I'd like to think there are no limits to our 'family', no limits to what can be done. I find that an exciting thought. I hope you do, too.<eos>"

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made mostly of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. There are more than three hundred varieties of honey. The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Research suggests that honey prevents tiredness and improves athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products.

San Francisco is a city in northern California, USA. It is located on the coast. The first Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Although San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the miners who got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin and were worn during cold weather. Today, we still use leather, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.<eos>"

When I injured my back, I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I decided to start a running group for women in my area because I was annoyed by the lack of women in the sport and the poor facilities they were being offered. I put up posters and many women, young and old, fit and unfit, joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves.<eos>"

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

In the winter months, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail.

Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, a city that is known for its beautiful scenery and friendly people. Standing with its feet in the water and its head in the mountains, this city allows its residents to ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city centre. There are a few passenger trains that run from Vancouver on the cross- continent railway. The ride is still a great adventure.

People who think that zoos are a good idea say that they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals.

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Although it doesn't happen often, when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods, which turn the streets into rivers. As many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain that does come is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.<eos>"

Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Winter driving is dangerous because it's difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents happen easily. Fog can be waiting for you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road.

To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen. If you drive smoothly, you can avoid making sudden movements that can make your car difficult to control. You should also test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

By following these rules, you can stay in control of your car and avoid trouble.

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art and became interested in early Italian artists. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

Last year, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked his parents for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, his parents were hesitant because of the noise. However, they eventually gave in. The drums are not easy to transport, so the other members of Ben's band started appearing at Ben's house with their instruments. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their singing. Ben's hobby has been good for his health. Whenever the band starts practising, his parents go out for a long walk. Although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. The main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet.<eos>"

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It gives young people the opportunity to gain experience of life outside the classroom and to study for their exams. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.<eos>"

Being an older student, I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary, although I was earning a reasonable amount of money, I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in the job. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who looked happy, carefree and full of hope, and part of something that I wanted to explore further. However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. They are always mistaking me for a lecturer and asking me questions I can't answer. I also feel separated from the lecturers because, although we are the same age, I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job, which is really important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. Then there are the normal student benefits of long holidays and theatre and cinema discounts. I often have doubts about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this late date has been a wise choice.<eos>"

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he began working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After he had driven it a long way, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T', which sold for $825. He was soon selling a lot of cars. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.<eos>"

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she went up the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink. When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters and socks with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present. On the walls of Jenny's office, there are lots of letters from happy customers all over the world.

Most house burglaries happen between the afternoon and evening, say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also ask your neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when you are away. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

The history of farming. Before people started farming, they had to go to the forest to find food. They moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

The Weather People are interested in the weather for a lot of reasons. It is important for people in many different jobs. For example, the weather makes a big difference for farmers. Many years ago, farmers spent a long time looking at the sky and at animals and flowers to try and learn more about the weather. Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain.

Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years.

Howard Bonnier Bray is a village about fifty kilometres west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there a few months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.<eos>"

In the 18th century, London was a big city with many problems. There were a lot of thieves and people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

**Questions:**

1. What does Bob Marvisch do at Lake Nipissing in winter?
2. What clothes do you need to wear when fishing on ice?
3. How do you catch fish on ice?
4. What is the average length of a fish that you can catch on ice?

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot. Lions are the only cats that stay together in large family groups. Several lions may work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. All cats need good eyes, because they catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast, and very strong.<eos>"

'I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.'

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. 'Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.'

People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for the otters. But today there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

Dinosaurs were giant animals that lived long ago. No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.

The bear is a powerful animal. It is very strong and can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and running very fast. But they cannot see well and, like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are different kinds of bear. The largest is the white polar bear, which is tall. There are two kinds of black bear: One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown. Everyone loves the panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is difficult to find food.

Dear Jeff, I'm having a good holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were all different here: red, yellow, purple. Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue
